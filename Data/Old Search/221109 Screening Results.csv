rayyan-881236429,Lay causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural correlates in five countries,2022,12,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY,2000-8198,13,1,,"Meyer, Caroline and Kampisiou, Christina and Triliva, Sofia and Knaevelsrud, Christine and Stammel, Nadine",,English,TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Background To date, cultural clinical research has primarily focused on differences between ethnic groups when investigating causal beliefs about mental disorders. While individual as well as contextual factors are considered important for gaining a better understanding of cultural influences, research on causal beliefs about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cultural correlates in laypersons is scarce. Objective This study aimed at gain a better understanding of the association between causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural aspects, as well as other contextual and individual correlates of causal beliefs. Method We conducted a cross-sectional, vignette-based online survey with 737 laypersons from Mexico, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, and Russia. Participants completed the illness perception questionnaire revised (IPQ-R) and reported several cultural and sociodemographic (e.g. country of residence, gender, personal values) as well as mental health-related variables (e.g. PTSD symptoms, previous seeking of help). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of individuals expressing similar causal beliefs for PTSD. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse covariates of class membership. Results LCA resulted in a three-class solution of casual beliefs: a traumatic event-focused class (41.1\%); an intrapersonal causes class (40.1\%); and a multiple causes class (18.0\%). Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed country of residence, gender, personal value of security, PTSD symptoms, and mental health literacy as significant covariates of class membership. Conclusions Integrating a more diverse concept of culture into cultural clinical research can be a valuable addition to group comparisons based on nationality or ethnicity. Cultural clinical research needs to move towards a more integrated approach that accounts for the complexity of culture. Including additional contextual and sociodemographic factors can help to reach a more accurate understanding of the cultural influences on the development of causal beliefs and mental health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not sure if PTSD counts",10.1080/20008198.2022.2029333,"Post-traumatic stress disorder; illness perceptions; values; trauma; cultural clinical psychology; Ecuador; Germany; Greece; Mexico; Russia;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Causality",,

This study explored traditional, religious, and cultural beliefs about causes of mental illness and the use of traditional/alternative treatments for mentally ill patients. Method We adopted a qualitative content analysis method as proposed by Schreier. This study was conducted at a mental Hospital in Indonesia. We interviewed 15 nurses and 15 patients.

Conclusion Traditional/alternative treatments play an important role in meeting the need for mental health treatment. The findings are relevant for mental health nurses who provide direct to their patients, and for other areas of mental health practice. We also found a lack of knowledge about the causes of mental illness among patients and families.

Therefore, we studied the association between mental health literacy (MHL) and active help-seeking in a community sample. Participants were recruited from an add-on questionnaire study to the `Bern Epidemiological At-Risk' (BEAR) study on 16-40-year-old community subjects of the Swiss canton Bern. At baseline, data of N = 1504, and at 3-year follow-up, data of N = 535 were available. Based on an unlabelled case vignette (on depression or schizophrenia), MHL was assessed by the questionnaire of Angermeyer and colleagues. Cross-sectional and longitudinal baseline predictors of help-seeking were analysed using path analyses. Additionally, sensitivity analyses of the prospective model were computed for sex, vignette, and baseline mental health problems/disorders. Cross-sectionally, help-seeking was associated with non-endorsement of biogenetic causal explanations, presence of mental health problems/disorders, help-seeking before baseline, poorer functioning, and lower health satisfaction. The prospective model was similar; yet, help-seeking at follow-up was associated with endorsements of the causal explanation `biogenetics' and, additionally, `childhood trauma' but not the presence of baseline mental health problems/disorders. Sensitivity analyses revealed a significant impact on sex, vignette, and mental health problems/disorders. For example, actual functional problems were predictive in males, while health satisfaction was predictive in females. Our findings indicate that future studies on drivers of help-seeking should assess very large community samples with case vignettes on different mental disorders to examine appropriate subgroups and their likely interaction to address group-specific factors in awareness campaigns.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00406-022-01483-9,Mental health literacy; Active help-seeking behaviour; Mental health problems; disorders; Longitudinal community study;Case-Control Studies,,

A cross-sectional, vignette-based online survey was conducted with 737 participants from Germany, Greece, Ecuador, Mexico, and Russia. Participants were presented with a short unlabeled case vignette describing a person with symptoms of PTSD. Causal beliefs were assessed using an open-ended question asking for the three most likely causes. Answers were analyzed using thematic analysis. Afterwards, themes were transformed into categorical variables to analyze differences by country and by gender. Qualitative analyses revealed a wide range of different causal beliefs. Themes differed by gender, with women tending to mention more external causal beliefs. Themes also differed between the five countries but the differences between countries were more pronounced for women than for men. In conclusion, causal beliefs were multifaceted among laypersons and shared basic characteristics with empirically derived risk factors. The more pronounced differences for women suggest that potential gender effects should be considered in cross-cultural research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not sure if PTSD counts",10.3390/ijerph191811594,"post-traumatic stress disorder; illness perceptions; explanatory models; trauma; cultural clinical research; mixed methods; intersectionality;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Causality",,

(3) Results: Several socio-demographic characteristics of YMR altered during the crisis (lower income, higher smoking/alcohol consumption, etc.). The majority of YMR conceived distress and burnout as serious syndromes requiring professional support. Feeling very susceptible and the necessity for establishing PAR interventions were frequently reported during the crisis. Numerous (a) barriers and (b) cues to action were mentioned: (a) lack of time, money and support from friends/family/colleagues (b) being extensively informed about the intervention, participation of their collaborators, and raising awareness events.

However, little is known about the role of offspring's achievement attribution in the relationship between parenting and offspring's psychological well-being. We aimed to find the role of adolescents' achievement attribution pattern in the relationship between parent-child communication quality and adolescents' mental health. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 2,725 adolescents aged from 9 to 18 years who are participating in the China Family Panel Studies. Participants supplied demographic information and completed a series of psychological scales including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, an adapted version of the Parental Bonding Instrument, an achievement attribution scale, and single-item measures of subjective well-being and subjective interpersonal popularity. Results Linear regression analysis revealed that after controlling for demographic factors good parent-child communication negatively correlated with depression symptoms, and positively associated with subjective well-being and subjective interpersonal popularity. Next, mediation analysis found that internal attribution of achievement partly mediated the effects of parent-child communication quality on adolescents' depression, subjective well-being, and subjective interpersonal popularity. The result was robust after controlling demographic variables. Conclusions An internal attribution pattern of achievement partially accounted for the associations between parent-child communication quality and adolescents' psychological outcomes including depression, subjective well-being, and subjective interpersonal popularity.

However, little is known about how stigma varies across different substance types, whether individuals are actively using or in recovery, and medical versus recreational onset. We examined these questions using data from the 2021 Shatterproof Addiction Stigma Index, the only nationally representative data available on this topic. Respondents (N = 7051) completed a vignette-based survey experiment to assess public stigma (social distance, prejudice, competence, and causal attributions) toward people with alcohol, opioid (following a prescription pain or recreational use onset), heroin, or methamphetamine dependencies. Vignette characters were described as active users or in recovery. Adjusting for covariates (e.g., race, age, gender), prejudice and desire for social distance were highest toward heroin and methamphetamine, and lowest toward alcohol dependence. The perceived onset of the dependency affected stigma. Specifically, prescription opioids with a recreational onset were more stigmatized than those with a medical onset. Moreover, individuals depicted as being in recovery were less stigmatized than those depicted as active users. Recovery status had the largest impact on prejudice and social distance toward methamphetamine, relative to other conditions. The nature and magnitude of substance dependency stigma differs across substance types and onset and offset conditions.

Participants were asked about challenging child behaviors that they have encountered, their perceptions of these behaviors and how they manage them, and their thought processes around suspension and expulsion. Overall, the most frequently reported categories of challenging behaviors were physical aggression and noncompliance/defiance/arguing. The most commonly reported perceived causes of challenging behaviors were typical child development and parenting problems. The primary reported strategy for addressing challenging behaviors was connecting with the child, with relatively few providers reporting using other evidence-based strategies. Finally, the most commonly reported reasons for considering suspension or expulsion were the providers feeling they had exhausted options and could not meet the child's needs, and the child's behavior being perceived as dangerous to self or others.

The virulence of the initial COVID-19 surge in Spain and the urgency for rapid evidence constrained early studies in their capacity to inform mental health programs accurately. Here, we used a qualitative research design to describe relevant mental health problems among frontline HCWs and explore their association with determinants and consequences and their implications for the design and implementation of mental health programs. Materials and methodsFollowing the Programme Design, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation (DIME) protocol, we used a two-step qualitative research design to interview frontline HCWs, mental health experts, administrators, and service planners in Spain. We used Free List (FL) interviews to identify problems experienced by frontline HCWs and Key informant (KI) interviews to describe them and explore their determinants and consequences, as well as the strategies considered useful to overcome these problems. We used a thematic analysis approach to analyze the interview outputs and framed our results into a five-level social-ecological model (intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public health). ResultsWe recruited 75 FL and 22 KI interviewees, roughly balanced in age and gender. We detected 56 themes during the FL interviews and explored the following themes in the KI interviews: fear of infection, psychological distress, stress, moral distress, and interpersonal conflicts among coworkers. We found that interviewees reported perceived causes and consequences across problems at all levels (intrapersonal to public health). Although several mental health strategies were implemented (especially at an intrapersonal and interpersonal level), most mental health needs remained unmet, especially at the organizational, community, and public policy levels. ConclusionsIn keeping with available quantitative evidence, our findings show that mental health problems are still relevant for frontline HCWs 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic and that many reported causes of these problems are modifiable. Based on this, we offer specific recommendations to design and implement mental health strategies and recommend using transdiagnostic, low-intensity, scalable psychological interventions contextually adapted and tailored for HCWs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not sure",10.3389/fpubh.2022.956403,psychological distress; mental health; occupational health; healthcare workers (HCWs); COVID-19; free list interviews; key informant interviews; qualitative study;Spain;Mental Health,,

The difficulties in children leading to their referral demonstrated a problematic parenting in which the diminished role of the father was causal. Beliefs about masculinity held within the family matrix were largely ones that functioned to fill epistemic lacunae. Such filling represents a double injustice. Not only is there very little empirically based thinking about fathers in our western culture for families to draw upon to make sense of their experiences. Instead, this dearth is often falsely compensated through ideologically derived pejorative concepts, that invariably do not relate to experience. The paper discusses the perniciousness of relying upon ideological perceptions of masculinity through focusing upon how easily they are acquired and work against the mental health of children and their families.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/13642537.2022.2101677,Class; epistemic injustice; fathers and mothers; femininity and masculinity; paternal function; transference;Only Child;Child;Referral and Consultation,,

We found that ``thinking too much{''} (kit chroeun) and ``worrying too much{''} (prouy / barom chroeun), cultural idioms of distress, were recognized as causal factors of schizophrenia by both parents and family caregivers. Some participants were aware of the possible causal factors in light of the latest psychiatry findings, such as genetic factors and childhood trauma. Our data show that causal beliefs are not a decisive factor in shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP).

Explanatory models matter because they are associated with internalized stigma and illness behaviors such as treatment preferences. Aims: This paper explores how working professionals in the United States draw on biological and/or environmental factors to explain the cause(s) of their diagnoses of bipolar or depression. Method: Findings are derived from an analysis of transcripts of in-depth interviews with 52 individuals from across the United States who were invited to participate in a study of working professionals diagnosed with mental illness. About 25 self-identified as having bipolar disorder and 27 as having major depression. Transcript data were analyzed following the principles of flexible coding with the goal of establishing a typology of explanatory models of self-identified bipolar versus depression. Results: Six types of explanatory models emerged from the analysis. One was exclusively biological, a second was exclusively environmental, and the remaining four combined biological and environmental factors in different ways. Quotations from the interviews are provided to illustrate each type, and comparisons between types are made based on primary diagnosis (bipolar vs. depression), and self-reports of trauma and stressful experiences.

This information can be used to guide more effective prevention and treatment. Objective: To conduct a large-scale national cohort study to identify the current etiological risk factors for problem gambling in Canada. Method: A cohort of 10,119 Canadian gamblers completed a comprehensive self-administered online questionnaire in 2018 and were reassessed in 2019. At baseline, the sample contained 1,388 at-risk gamblers, 1,346 problem gamblers, and 2,710 with a major DSM-5 mental health disorder. A total of 108 independent variables (IVs) were available for analysis, as well as the self-report of perceived causes of gambling-related problems for 1,261 individuals. Results: The strongest multivariate predictors of current and future problem gambling were ``gambling-related{''} variables (i.e., current and past problem gambling, intensive gambling involvement, playing electronic gambling machines (EGMs), gambling fallacies, socializing with other people having gambling-related problems, and family history of having gambling-related problems). Beyond gambling-related variables, greater impulsivity and lower household income were robustly predictive. Thirteen additional variables were either concurrently or prospectively predictive, but not both. In contrast to the many different quantitative predictors, self-reported causes tended to be singular and psychologically oriented (i.e., desire to win money, boredom, stress, poor self-control). Conclusions: The predictors of problematic gambling in the present study are very similar to the predictors identified in prior international longitudinal and cross-sectional research.

Criteria derived from research conducted primarily among adult Western populations inform current diagnostic standards for depression. These clinical categories are often used without exploration of their relevance to adolescent experience. Also, reliance on these categories may overlook other symptoms of depression that manifest in non-western settings. Cross-cultural qualitative work with adults in non-Western settings has suggested some differences with experience of depression and symptoms that are most relevant to service users. Research into adolescent experiences of depression is warranted to inform the development of effective interventions. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted in Nepal with adolescents with depressive symptoms (n = 9), healthy adolescents (n = 3), parents (n = 6), teachers (n = 10), social workers (n = 14), primary (n = 6) and mental (n = 6) healthcare providers, and policymakers (n = 6). Two focus groups were conducted with parents (n = 12) of depressed and non-depressed adolescents. Data were analyzed according to the framework approach methodology. Results Loneliness was the hallmark experience that stood out for all adolescents. This was connected with 5 other clusters of symptoms: low mood and anhedonia; disturbances in sleep and appetite, accompanied by fatigue; irritability and anger; negative self-appraisals including hopelessness and self-doubt; and suicidality. Adolescents distinguished depression from other forms of stress, locally referred to as tension, and described depression to involve having ``deep tension.{''} Perceived causes of depression included (1) Family issues: neglectful or absent parents, relationship problems, and family discord; (2) Peer relationships: romantic problems, bullying, and friendship problems; and (3) Social media: social comparison, popularity metrics, cyberbullying, and leaking of personal information. Conclusions Consistent with other cross-cultural studies, loneliness was a core element of the adolescent experience of depression, despite its absence as a primary symptom in current psychiatric diagnostic classifications. It is important to note that among youth, symptoms were clustered together and interrelated (e.g., sleep and appetite changes were connected with fatigue). This calls for the need for more cross-cultural qualitative research on experience of depression among adolescents, and potential for modification of diagnostic criteria and prevention and treatments to focus on the experience of loneliness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s13034-022-00481-y,Depression; Loneliness; Social isolation; Qualitative research; Adolescence; Nepal;Adolescent;Nepal,,

Malingering has traditionally been considered rare in general psychiatry. In contrast to earlier estimates, more recent studies report that doctors suspect malingering frequently in psychiatric emergency departments. The aim of this study is to survey how often doctors in psychiatric emergency units in a public, free-of-charge, mental health service suspect that patients are malingering, and which diagnoses, symptom complaints and suspected reasons for malingering doctors ascribe to their patients. Methods Questionnaires were distributed in three psychiatric emergency departments in Denmark. Suspected simulation and exaggeration were rated with a 5-point scale. Doctors were encouraged to write down the symptoms and perceived causes for suspected malingering. Results 362 questionnaires were filled in. 25\% of all patients were suspected of simulating to some degree. 8\% of patients were highly suspected or definitely believed to be simulating. Patients complaining of suicidal ideation were most frequently suspected of malingering. `Attention seeking' was the most common suspected reason for malingering. Patients with diagnoses of substance use and personality disorder were the most suspected of malingering. Conclusion This is the first study to investigate doctors' suspicions of psychiatric malingering in a European setting. Patients with established personality and substance use disorder are at higher risk of being suspected of malingering, which potentially affects the course of treatment significantly. The rise in suspected malingering is conspicuous and requires further investigation. Doctors are encouraged to act conservatively upon suspicion of malingering in emergency psychiatry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/08039488.2022.2083676,Suspicion; emergency psychiatry; psychosis; suicide; simulation; symptom exaggeration;Emergencies,,

This study examined how causal attributions for schizophrenia contribute to interest in a hypothetical genetic test. People with schizophrenia and first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia were recruited through a schizophrenia research bank and mental health organisation. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 13 individuals with schizophrenia and 8 first-degree relatives. Transcripts were subjected to a qualitative analysis using the thematic analysis framework. Five themes were developed: (i) ``It is like a cocktail{''}, with most participants aware that both genetic and environmental factors contributed to causation, and many mentioning the positive impact of genetic causal explanations; (ii) ``Knowledge is power{''} (i.e., in favour of genetic testing); (iii) Genetic testing provides opportunities for early intervention and avoiding triggers, with participants citing a wide range of perceived benefits of genetic testing but few risks; (iv) Views on reproductive genetic testing for schizophrenia risk with a few participants viewing it as ``playing God{''} but not necessarily being against it; and (v) ``It snowballs{''}, whereby participants' understanding of genetics was sophisticated with most believing that multiple rather than single genes contributed to schizophrenia.

After applying exclusion criteria, 52 relevant research studies were identified. Findings The reviewed studies spanned a variety of themes such as barriers and facilitators to help-seeking, sources of help-seeking, causal attributions as well as other correlates of help-seeking, process of help-seeking and interventions to increase help-seeking. The majority of these studies were carried out in general community samples or treatment-seeking samples. Very few studies incorporated non-treatment seeking distressed samples. There is a severe dearth of studies on interventions to improve help-seeking. Studies indicate multiple barriers to seeking professional help and highlight that mere knowledge about illness and availability of professional services may be insufficient to minimize delays in professional help-seeking. Originality/value Help-seeking in the Indian context is often a family-based decision-making process. Multi-pronged help-seeking interventions that include components aimed at reducing barriers experienced by non-treatment seeking distressed persons and empowering informal support providers with knowledge and skills for encouraging professional help-seeking in their significant others may be useful.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1108/JHR-02-2020-0040,Barriers; Help-seeking; Help-seeking intervention; Mental health; India,,

Social support within faith communities has been noted as an important mental health resource and faith leaders often represent the first point of contact in a mental health or substance abuse crisis. Yet, faith communities can also perpetuate stigmatization. Based on a vignette-based survey of congregants (N = 1,796) in a diverse set of faith communities in the U.S., this study examines desired social distance as a proxy of stigma toward mental illness (depression and schizophrenia vignettes) and substance use disorders (alcohol and drug use disorder vignettes). Analyses show that survey respondents' stigmatizing attitudes toward persons with mental health and substance use conditions in faith communities vary strongly by the type of condition. Familiarity with depression is associated with less stigma toward the disorder, but familiarity with the other conditions is not a significant predictor of stigma in the other vignettes. Levels of agreement with biogenetic and psychosocial causal attributions are high, but important associations of personal/moral and spiritual causal attributions with higher levels of desired social distance are found. The results imply that interventions to mitigate stigma in faith communities should consider differences by condition types and the particular characteristics of faith-based settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1037/sah0000373,religion and faith communities; stigma; mental illness and substance use disorders; familiarity; causal attributions;Substance-Related Disorders;Causality,,

However, the prevalence of PMH conditions vary considerably. These disparities stem in part from poor understanding and stigma surrounding PMH which hinder pregnant women from seeking mental health care and may exacerbate their conditions. Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are South Asian countries with a higher burden of PMH conditions than in the Global North-West and very different social and cultural norms around gender and mental health. The aim of this systematic review (PROSPERO Ref: CRD42020167903) was to identify, synthesise and appraise the available literature on perceptions and attitudes of perinatal (pregnant and postpartum) women, their families and healthcare providers surrounding PMH in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Methods Five electronic databases, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of science, and grey literature were searched using predefined search terms. Qualitative or quantitative articles with a qualitative component reporting perceptions and attitudes surrounding PMH in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan were eligible for inclusion, if published in English between January 2000 and January 2021. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Research Checklist and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional studies were used to assess study quality. Findings were synthesised using thematic synthesis, as described by Thomas and Harden 2008. Results Eight studies were included. Five overarching themes comprising 17 sub-categories were identified. These descriptive themes were: perceived causes of PMH, perceived symptoms of PMH, perceptions of motherhood, accessing PMH care and emotional sharing and coping strategies. Sociocultural expectations underpin many of the themes identified in this review including the importance of familial and societal causes of PMH, emphasis on physical symptoms, sacredness of motherhood, lack of awareness, stigma, shame, limited resources allocated for mental health and lack of emotional sharing. Conclusions There is a complex range of perceptions and attitudes around PMH which influence women's experiences and access to PMH care. These findings will inform policy and practice through targeted interventions to tackle stigmatising attitudes and increasing education and training for healthcare providers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s12884-022-04642-x,Perinatal mental health; South Asia; Perceptions; Attitudes;Bangladesh;Pakistan;India,,

Using the Intellectual Disability Literacy Scale, adapted for Chile, we explored the participants' literacy about ID, their causal beliefs, and desire of social distance. Only 1.3\% of the sample identified intellectual disability in the instrument's vignette. The most common causal attribution for the condition was environmental, followed by biomedical factors. Participants showed a high desire of social distance, with higher scores associated with more educated participants. Our findings show that low literacy about intellectual disability and a high desire for social distance are significant factors contributing to public stigma in Chile. These are tangible targets for change that can lead to increased social inclusion and participation of people with intellectual disability in Chile.

Emerging research supports the role of chronic stress in chronic disease development. The objective was to perform a scoping review mapping the field of research exploring relationships between chronic stress and the development of arthritis in adult populations. Methods. Five electronic databases were systematically searched without publication limits based on 3 key concepts: stress, arthritis, and adults. Eligible qualitative studies investigated individuals' perceived causes of arthritis; quantitative studies investigated relationships between exposure to a chronic stressor and an arthritis presence outcome. Articles were screened by 2 independent reviewers, and data were narratively synthesized. Results. Of 1,819 unique records, 54 studies met inclusion criteria. Nine studies used qualitative methods, and 45 used quantitative methods. The frequency of studies increased chronologically, with half (n = 27) published since 2010. Chronic stress exposures were heterogenous; most were categorized as adverse life events (n = 22) or adverse childhood experiences (n = 17). Self-reported arthritis was the most frequent measure of arthritis outcome (n = 26) in quantitative studies. A majority of studies (n = 41) suggested a relationship between exposure to chronic stressors and arthritis development. Conclusion. Increasing study numbers in the past decade may reflect increasing awareness of the potential impact of chronic stress in arthritis development, consistent with a biopsychosocial approach to chronic disease etiology and management. Further research, using precise arthritis definitions, conducted within a clearly articulated pathophysiologic framework, is required to establish a causal relationship between exposure to chronic stressors and the development of specific arthritis conditions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/acr.24528,"",,

Caregivers play a critical role in the outcome of mental illness in their children, yet there is limited research on effective means to engage caregivers in the ED and provide the support they need. Our aim was to determine caregivers' perceptions about mental illness in their children, specifically regarding suicidality and depression, the impact of the children's mental health on the caregiver, and barriers to and facilitators of treatment. Methods Guided by qualitative descriptive methodology, we conducted semistructured, open-ended interviews with a purposive sample of English-speaking primary caregivers of children 6 to 17 years old who presented with suicidal ideations or behaviors to 1 urban pediatric ED. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and conventional content analysis was performed. Results The participants (n = 20) were largely single ethnic-racial minority mothers.

Initial analysis found that chronic illness was negatively related to positive mental health (beta= -0.72, P < 0.001) and positively related to psychological distress (beta=0.98, P < 0.001). The final structural model found that physical activity and social support partially mediated the negative consequences of chronic disease on psychological distress and strengthened seniors' positive mental health. Limitations: Limiting causal attribution, potential reporting bias and limited in recognizing negative and positive social support are the major limitations. Conclusions: Older adults with chronic diseases should be encouraged to increase physical activity and social support levels. The study outcomes have clinical implications for the delivery of mental health services to improve mental health and resilience to coping with stress among older adults.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.055,Chronic disease; Mental health; Physical activity; Structural equation modeling; Social support; National population sample;Chronic Disease;Motor Activity,,

The present study aimed to explore how psychosocial causal beliefs, stereotypes, and emotional reactions could affect professional help-seeking preferences. A representative community-based sample of Taiwanese adults aged 20-65 (n = 800) was recruited by a random-digit-dialing computer-assisted telephone interviewing system. Participants were asked to describe their psychosocial causal beliefs, stereotypes, emotional reactions, and professional help-seeking preferences for a person with depression described in a case vignette. Serial mediation analyses were conducted to test the direct and indirect effects of psychosocial causal beliefs on professional help-seeking preferences. Psychosocial causal beliefs were positively associated with perceived dependency, which resulted in stronger pity and, in turn, increased help-seeking preferences for mental health professionals. Psychosocial causal beliefs were positively associated with perceived dependency, which resulted in stronger fear and, in turn, increased help-seeking preferences for other medical professionals (i.e., general practitioner, and Chinese medical doctor). This study indicated that reducing negative emotions such as fear and increasing pity were likely to be useful in promoting public preferences to seek help from mental health professionals. Understanding the complex associations between causal beliefs, stereotypes, emotional reactions, and help-seeking preferences might enable further work in designing evidence-based interventions for depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s12144-021-02683-7,Depression; Stigma; Public mental health; Treatment; Health service;Causality,,

To reduce the burden in psychiatric hospitals, Government has decentralized mental health services. Although Government has provided mental health services, the utilization has always been low due to many reasons. In the present study, an attempt was made to assess the accessibility and the barriers to utilizing mental health services with various community stakeholders.

The primary data were collected through focused group discussions and interview methods. The collected data were analyzed using thematic coding. RESULTS: A total of twenty-five factors have been identified in the study, which were categorized under eight themes. (a) Lack of awareness and misinformation on mental health, illness, and available services, (b) Perceived causes for mental illness, (c) Reasons for not approaching health professionals, (d) Treatment adherence-related issues, (e) No multidisciplinary team in private hospitals and lack of involvement in government sector (f) Manpower issues, (g) Quality of service issues and building confidence among community people, and (h) Belief system and stigma.

The Power Threat Meaning Framework (PTMF) offers an alternative to mental diagnosis by providing a different way to formulate patterns of emotional distress, experiences and behaviour. The aim of this cross-sectional survey study was to use vignettes to compare 107 trainee psychologists' perceptions of a mental health client using a traditional diagnostic framework and the PTMF. Specifically, these included perceptions of willingness to work with the client, perceptions of recovery and the attributions of causal beliefs of the client's difficulties. Results indicated that participants in the diagnostic group were more likely to attribute the client's difficulties to genetic causes and a chemical imbalance, and less likely to attribute these to the client's upbringing. Participants were more willing to work with the client if they believed the client had a better chance of recovery. These findings indicate the need to change how psychology trainees are educated about diagnosis and recovery to include broader interpretations of the causes of mental health difficulties, and to see recovery as more than a reduction of symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",,causal attributions; power threat meaning framework; psychologists; recovery; training; willingness,,

Physiological ovarian masses are non-neoplastic. Pathological masses grow more than 7 cm and persist beyond 3 months; they do not resolve spontaneously, and invasive surgery with removal of reproductive organs is the conventional treatment. It usually results in further co-morbidities and hampers the quality of life of the patient. Objectives This case series of pathological left ovarian masses demonstrates the role of homeopathic treatment in each of two multiparous women where the right ovary was surgically removed previously for similar pathology and in an adolescent girl with increased tumor marker CA-125. Methods Three cases of women with pathological ovarian masses in the left ovary, and advised invasive surgery by attending gynecologists, were treated with homeopathic medicines at the outpatient department of the National Homeopathy Research Institute in Mental Health, Kottayam, Kerala, from 2017 to 2020. Each case was followed up with clinical and ultrasonographic evidence and reported according to the criteria set out in the HOM-CASE guidelines. Result Complete resolution of the ovarian masses was observed in all three cases, evidenced by ultrasonography, with normalizing CA-125 values also observed in the case of endometrial cyst. The patients improved within 4 to 15 months of treatment using Thuja and other individualized homeopathic medicines. The MONARCH score was calculated as +7/13, +9/13, and +9/13 for the three cases, respectively, indicating a positive causal attribution of homeopathy in the resolution of these pathological ovarian masses.

Data was inductively explored for themes and analysis was informed by the Framework Method. Across the three sites, illness experiences featured suffering and disability in different life domains. Predominant causal attribution was supernatural, even when biological causation was also acknowledged. Prayer and rituals, steeped in traditional spiritual beliefs, were prominent both in traditional faith healing settings as well as those of Christianity and Islam. Concurrent or consecutive use of TFHs and conventional medical services was common. TFHs provided services that appear to meet the therapeutic goals of their patients even when harmful treatment practices were employed. Cultural and linguistic differences did not obscure the commonality of a core set of beliefs and practices across these three groups. This similarity of core worldviews across diverse cultural settings means that a collaborative approach designed in one cultural group would, with adaptations to reflect differences in context, be applicable in another cultural group.

This study assessed the factorial validity of measures of beliefs about depression's causes and formal treatment versus selfmanagement. It also tested the links of causal attributions to general treatment/self-management beliefs and endorsement of specific interventions. Methods: The revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) adapted for depression was administered online to a non-patient, U.S. sample (N = 319). Results: Confirmatory factor analyses yielded three causal dimensions, Environmental Stressors, Biological Factors, and Personal Attributes, and two control dimensions, (Formal) Treatment and Personal. Both models fit irrespective of whether respondents believed they had ever experienced depression. A structural equation model (SEM) showed a positive relationship for Environmental and Biological attributions, and an inverse relationship for Personal attributions, in predicting general preferences for Formal Treatment. A second SEM, focusing on specific interventions, linked Environmental causation to endorsement of psychotherapy, dietary changes, and self-help, and Biological causation to endorsement of medication and exercise, with Personal causation inversely associated with endorsement of psychotherapy. Limitations: A cross-sectional, correlational design precludes causal inferences. Potential sociocultural influences were not assessed. Conclusions: Modifications to the IPQ-R suggested by this study improved its psychometric properties, validated its distinction between Treatment and Personal Control beliefs, and supported examination of both general and specific beliefs about ways to deal with depression.

Therefore, an anti-stigma intervention study to support help-seeking behaviour will be developed on the basis of the newly explicated ``Seeking Mental Health Care Model{''}. Methods: A quasi-experimental online study will be carried out to assess the effect of different intervention variables relevant for the help-seeking process. The study is conceived as a fractional factorial design. Participants will be screened for depressive complaints (PHQ-9 sum score >= 8) and current psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment. After baseline assessment the participants will be randomly allocated into one of the 24 study groups receiving different combinations of the vignette-based intervention aiming to reduce stigma and support help-seeking. Next, relevant outcome measures will be administered a second time. In a 3- and 6-month follow-up help-seeking behaviour will be measured. Gamified elements and avatar-choice techniques will be used to heighten study immersion and adherence.

Results The results indicate that veterinarians are exposed to a range of rude behaviours from clients, with suggested causal attributions spanning financial concerns, stress and worry. Adverse consequences associated with uncivil interactions included increased stress, mental health impacts and withdrawal from clients. Responses to incivility encompassed proactive pre-planning, empathy and clear communication. Support from colleagues was important to enable reflection and coping, alongside individual strategies, such as self-care.

However, less is known about causal beliefs of mental health professionals (MHPs) and their impact on treatment adherence and service engagement. This review explored literature focusing on MHPs' causal beliefs and mapped the degree of concordance between their causal beliefs and those of people with psychosis. Methods: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Applied Social Sciences Index Abstracts and a gray-literature search of PsyArXiv and MedNar yielded 11,821 eligible references. The first author reviewed all titles and abstracts, and the coauthors reviewed 10\% (N=1,200). Results: Forty-two articles were included. Most articles indicated that MHPs tend to endorse biogenetic beliefs (9 of 15 articles assessing MHPs' beliefs, 60\%), whereas people with psychosis tend to endorse psychosocial beliefs (16 of 31 articles, 52\%) and other nonbiogenetic beliefs (in 8 of 31 articles, 26\%). Most studies did not compare causal beliefs of people with psychosis and their treating MHP. Studies varied in design, setting, and measures. Conclusions: MHPs and people with psychosis often hold complex views composed of different types of causal beliefs. However, a gap in causal beliefs between these groups appears to exist, which may affect the therapeutic relationship and pose barriers to treatment adherence. Future studies should address this gap by developing interventions that facilitate open communication about causal beliefs to promote treatment alliance and shared decision making.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1176/appi.ps.202000460,Psychotic Disorders,,

This study explores: (1) workers' perceived causes of sickness absence; (2) perceived return to work (RTW) barriers and facilitators; and (3) differences between workers with short, medium and long-term sickness absence. Methods A longitudinal qualitative study was conducted involving 34 workers with CMDs. Semi-structured interviews were held at two time-points during their RTW process. The 68 interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and thematically analyzed to explore workers' perspective on sickness absence causes, RTW barriers and facilitators, and compare data across the three sub-groups of workers. Results Workers reported various causes for their absence, including: (1) high work pressure; (2) poor work relationships; (3) unhelpful thoughts and feelings, e.g. lacking self-insight; and (4) ineffective coping behaviors. According to workers, RTW was facilitated by work adjustments, fulfilling relationships with supervisors, and adequate occupational health guidance. Workers with short-term leave more often reported favorable work conditions, and proactive coping behavior. In contrast, the long-term group reported reactive coping behavior and dissatisfaction with their work. Conclusion Supporting workers with CMDs in gaining self-awareness and regaining control, discussing the value of their work, and creating work conditions that enable workers to do valuable work, seem central for successful RTW and might prevent sickness absence. Supervisors play a key role in enabling workers to do valuable work and further research should focus on how supervisors can be supported in this task.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10926-021-10004-9,Mental health; Work disability prevention; Sick leave; Return-to-work; Workers' perspective; Barriers and facilitators;Mental Disorders,,

There is still a disconnect between available services and help-seeking behaviours at the grassroots level. This study aims to explore the perceptions of Javanese people on the aetiology of mental illness and their ideas on how to deal with individuals who may have mental illness. Methods This qualitative study involves semi-structured interviews, embedded in a cluster randomised trial examining the clinical and cost-effectiveness of primary mental health services. Interviews were conducted with Indonesian and Javanese. The recruitment procedure was aligned to the trial. Participants were primary care patients recruited from 21 sites across Yogyakarta province. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview transcripts. Results 75 participants took part in the study: 51 women (68\%) and 24 men (32\%). Key themes emerged around perceived causes of mental health problems (including `extrinsic factors'; `intrinsic factors'; and `spiritual factors'), and perceived appropriate pathways of care ('modern medical science'; `social support and activities'; and `religious or spiritual interventions'). Gender potentially influenced some of the responses. Conclusions Themes indicate the variety of preconceptions towards mental health problems and assumptions regarding the best management pathways. Some of these preconceptions and assumptions support the utility of modern medical care, while the rest promote spiritual or religious healers. Participants' ideas of the appropriate care pathways largely correspond to their perception of what the symptoms are caused by. Despite hints to some understanding of the bio-psycho-social model of mental illness, most participants did not capture the complexity of mental health and illness, indicating the importance of contextual (especially culturally and religiously-aligned) public education around mental health, illness and care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s13033-021-00497-5,Colonial society; Colonial mental health care; Low and middle-income countries; Public perception; Mental health perceptions; Qualitative study; Indonesia;Mentally Ill Persons,,

With growing concern about increasing prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents, the expanded roles of pharmacists in providing mental health services may be essential. This study aimed to explore the perspective of community pharmacists in child and adolescent mental healthcare (CAMH) service provision. A qualitative study em-ploying semi-structured face-to-face individual interviews was conducted among 25 com-munity pharmacists in Accra to explore their perspectives and experiences in service pro-vision for children and adolescents with mental illness. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed in line with the study objective. Emerging themes from the results are presented and supported by narratives from the community phar-macists. Most of the participants were female ( n = 15, 60\%), 32.32 +/- 10 years old and have an average of 7.68 +/- 9.4 years of professional practice. The m main themes identified from the findings were (1) Illness perception (2) Use of medicines (3) CAMH service pro-vision practices and (4) Barriers to CAMH service provision. The participants' perception about child and adolescent mental illness was along the dimensions of causal beliefs. They also acknowledged the role of medications in symptom reduction and improved mental health outcomes while indicating their safety concerns about these medicines. Community pharmacists were involved in CAMH activities by providing medication-related support, triaging, and appropriate referrals. However, barriers such as inadequate training, lack of subsidies for psychotropic medications for community pharmacies and poor linkage with health providers and facilities, limit community pharmacists' involvement in the provision of these services. CAMH service provision by community pharmacists could be facilitated by training, psychotropic medicines subsidy support and enhanced linkage with hospitals while high-lighting greater recognition of these services at the community level to support the policy agenda of deinstitutionalizing mental healthcare.

However, little is known about whether different biogenetic causal explanation beliefs differentially affect stigmatizing attitudes. This is particularly valid for the endorsement of the mild encephalitis hypothesis of schizophrenia.</p> Aim: To examine to what extent different causal explanations of schizophrenia influence the desire for social distance from persons with schizophrenia.</p> Methods: A study with a prospective, quasi-experimental design was carried out with students in Germany (N = 333). A case vignette depicting a person with schizophrenia-typical symptoms was presented, and a social distance scale (SDS) was used to measure the stigmatizing attitude against the person described. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups receiving different causal explanations of schizophrenia (genetic, mild encephalitis hypothesis, or psychosocial) without treatment information.</p> Results: A one-way ANOVA showed that the mean SDS was lowest in the group with the mild encephalitis hypothesis explanation, followed by the genetic explanation group, and highest in the psychosocial explanation group. However, the differences between the groups were small and not significant. A subanalysis revealed a significant interaction between gender and causal explanation. Women showed a significantly lower desire for social distance than men when receiving the mild encephalitis hypothesis. Neither the study discipline nor the number of semesters of study had significant effects on the mean SDS. The differences between the mean SDS scores for the different items were much bigger than the differences for the different causal explanations. Regardless of the causal explanation, the extent of the desired social distance depends strongly on social proximity.</p> Conclusion: The present study fits into previous research, which has found that biogenetic beliefs were either associated with more social distance or did not yield a statistically significant association. Although we found a small gender-specific effect of the endorsement of the mild encephalitis hypothesis, we do not recommend gender-specific anti-stigmatization campaigns because they might rightly raise suspicions of dishonesty and manipulation.

Method A total of 507 adolescents (N = 139 Germans; N = 126 Immigrants; N = 242 Turks) read a vignette describing a 16-year-old female with bulimic symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires on mental health literacy, stigmatization, desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors and acquaintance with bulimic symptoms. Results Adolescents living in Germany were more likely to recognize the vignette as an eating disorder than Turks. Immigrants were more similar to Germans in mental health literacy of eating disorders than Turks. However, in terms of stigmatizing attitudes, immigrants blamed more than Germans, Turks being intermediate on this variable. In Turks, higher desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors was associated with an increased acquaintance with bulimic symptoms and decreased evaluations of impairment. Higher mental health literacy was associated with less blame in Germans.

The prevalence rates are especially high among young adults and women. Young adults need to deal with challenges connected to growing up and entering the labour market, their young age often leaving them with little experience and a low level of preparedness for failure. Moreover, young women and men are confronted with gender norms and expectations that have been found to affect both sick leave and return to work. While managers have been shown to have a significant impact on the well-being of employees, few studies investigate the experiences of both employees and managers in relation to sick leave and return to work among youth. The aim of this study is to investigate perceived causes of sick leave owing to common mental disorders as well as barriers to and resources for return to work for young employees, from the perspectives of both employees and managers. Furthermore, differences and similarities in the patterns of experiences of women and men will be analyzed. Methods and analysis: This study has a qualitative research design. Data will consist of individual interviews with employees aged 19-29 and managers in female- and male-dominated occupations in a Swedish setting. The participants will be recruited using a purposive sampling strategy. The interviews will be analysed in two steps: firstly, a conventional content analysis will be conducted. Secondly, a gender analysis focusing social relations and gender order will be applied to interpret the data by examining differences and similarities in the patterns of experiences of women and men.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1177/16094069211032071,critical feminist theory; feminist research; interpretive description; methods in qualitative inquiry; critical theory,,

Diminished mental health is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and may contribute to loss of independence and motivation in patients receiving dialysis and their caregivers. Increased understanding of the patient perspective on triggers, impacts and strategies for managing mental health may inform ways to address mental health conditions in this population. Methods. A secondary thematic analysis was undertaken using data from the Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology (SONG)-Hemodialysis and SONG-Peritoneal Dialysis projects. We extracted and analysed data on the perceived causes, meaning, impact and management of mental health in patients receiving dialysis from 26 focus groups (in six countries), multinational Delphi surveys and consensus workshops. Results. A total of 644 patients and caregivers participated. We identified five themes: bound to dialysis (forced into isolation, enslaved to a machine, stress of relentless planning and grieving the loss of a normal life), underrecognized and ignored (missed by health practitioners, need for mental health support), an uncertain future (dreading complications, coming to terms with mortality), developing self-reliance (vulnerability in being solely responsible for dialysis, sustaining motivation for dialysis, necessity for self-vigilance and taking charge to regulate emotions) and responding to a lifestyle overhaul (guilt of burdening family, controlling symptoms for overall mental wellness, protecting independence and trying to feel grateful). Conclusions. Patients receiving dialysis and their caregivers endure mental and emotional distress attributed to the burden of dialysis, lifestyle restrictions, the constant threat of death and symptom burden, which can impair motivation for self-management. Increased attention to monitoring and management of mental health in this population is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1093/ndt/gfaa346,anxiety; depression; hemodialysis; mental health; peritoneal dialysis,,

Positive emotional experiences are a central component of overall well-being. However, research exploring what adolescents perceive to be the cause(s) of their emotional difficulties is lacking. Improving understanding of this issue within non-clinical adolescent groups may provide useful insight into how to develop strategies to support young people as they navigate emotional difficulties.

The current paper considers whether the rising incidence of psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic may affect lay beliefs about the cause and course of mental illness. Laypeople's causal attributions and expectations regarding the trajectory of mental illness have important implications for societal stigma and therapeutic orientations. Two online experimental studies investigated whether reading about fictional cases of mental illness that were explicitly situated during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with reading about the same cases without any pandemic-related contextualisation, affected attributions and expectations about Generalised Anxiety Disorder (Study 1) and Major Depressive Disorder (Study 2). Study 1 (n = 137) results showed that highlighting the onset of anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic weakened attributions to biological causes and reduced the anticipated duration of symptoms. However, Study 2 (n = 129) revealed no effects of COVID-19 contextualisation on beliefs about the cause or course of depression. The research provides preliminary evidence that the increased incidence of mental illness during the pandemic may reshape public beliefs about certain mental illnesses.

However, before arriving in Europe, the vast majority of African migrants who take the Mediterranean route are exposed to trauma and hardship. Moreover, the joint occurrence of forced displacement, trauma, and extended separation from families has a significant impact on mental health. Objectives: This study explores the role of culture-specific conceptualizations of family structures and transnationalism in explanatory models of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among male Cameroonian asylum-seekers and undocumented migrants in Europe. Methods: An in-depth study of two samples of Cameroonian migrants with a precarious residency status in Europe was conducted. Focus group discussions and interviews were carried out with asylum seekers in Germany (n = 8) and undocumented migrants and failed asylum seekers in France (n = 9). The verbatim transcripts of these interviews served as the data for interpretative phenomenological analyses. Results, Analysis, and Discussion: Family was conceptualized in religious and spiritual terms, and relational spirituality appeared to be a crucial element of family cohesion. Explanatory models of PTSD were mainly based on an intersection of family and spirituality. The disrespect of transgenerational, traditional, and spiritual obligations toward parents and ancestral spirits represented a crucial causal attribution for post-traumatic symptoms. Conclusions: Conceptualizations of post-traumatic stress were based on a collective family and spiritual level instead of an individualized illness-centered perception. The Western psychological and psychiatric perspective on post-traumatic stress might conflict with traditional, religious, and spiritual practices in the context of family conceptualizations of Cameroonian forced migrants with a precarious residency status.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.621918,"asylum seekers; explanatory models; family; post-traumatic stress; transnationalism; trauma; undocumented migrants;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Europe",,

One concern is the potential impact of genomics research on stigma experienced by people affected by a disease. Studies have found that the type of illness as well as disease causal beliefs impact on the relation between genetic attribution and stigma. This study explored the potential impact of genetic attribution of disease on stigma among Xhosa people with Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD). Methods: Study participants were 46 Xhosa people with RHD living in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Using video vignettes in 7 focus group discussions we explored whether and how genetic attribution may impact on disease-stigma. Vignettes introduced participants to non-genetic and genetic causal explanations and were followed-up with a series of open-ended questions eliciting their perceptions of non-genetic disease causes as well as genetic causation and its impact on internalised stigma. Results: This study found that Xhosa people with RHD have a general understanding of genetics and genetic attribution for disease. Additionally, and not withstanding their genetic knowledge, these participants hold multiple disease causal beliefs including genetic, infectious disease, psychosocial, behavioural and cultural explanations. While there was evidence of internalised stigma experiences among participants, these appeared not to be related to a genetic attribution to the disease. Discussion: The findings of this study provide clues as to why it is unlikely that a genetic conceptualisation of disease impacts internalised stigma experiences of Xhosa people.

The Community Informant Detection Tool (CIDT) is one such approach used for detecting mental health problems, including depression. We adapted this community informant approach for detecting maternal depression in Pakistan. Methods: Adaptation of Community Informant Detection Tool for Maternal Depression (CIDT-MD) involved five steps. First, a scoping review of the literature was conducted to select an appropriate tool for adaptation. Second, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore the idioms of depression and distress, perceived causes, and the effects of maternal depression among currently depressed and recovered mothers (n = 11), mothers in law (n = 6), and Primary Care Providers (Primary Care Physicians and Lady Health Supervisors) (n = 6). Third, case vignettes and illustrations were created with input from a panel of mental health experts, incorporating the idioms of depression and distress used, causes, and effects for each symptom described. Fourth, to assess the comprehensibility of the illustrations and level of understanding, Focus Group Discussions (n = 4) were done with purposely selected community health workers (Lady Health Workers and Lay Peers, n = 28) trained in delivering maternal depression intervention. The final step was reflection and inputs by a panel of mental health experts on all steps to finalize the content of the tool. Results: Context-specific cultural adaptation in the presentation and format of CIDT-MD was conducted successfully. Lady Health Workers (LHW) and Lay Peers (LP) were found to be the most appropriate persons to use the tool and function as the informants. The adapted tool with all its vignettes and illustrations was found to be easily understandable, comprehensible, and culturally appropriate, meaningful, and contextually relevant by the community health workers and peers working in the relevant settings. They easily relate to and identify potentially depressed such women lining up with the tool. Lastly, the coding of the tool was found easy to follow as well. Conclusion: The Community Informant Detection Tool for Maternal Depression (CIDT-MD) is a culturally acceptable, easy to use, and comprehensible tool for detecting maternal depression in community settings of Pakistan. The community informants found the content and approach highly relevant to the local needs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not sure",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.598857,cultural adaptation; community informant; detection tool; maternal depression; Pakistan; Proactive Case Detection;Pakistan,,

The ``mixed-blessings{''} model suggests that biogenetic explanations and greater stigma are linked by essentialism. The present study tests this hypothesis experimentally. In this online experiment, 367 subjects read either a biogenetic or a psychosocial explanation for the etiology of schizophrenia, followed by a vignette describing an individual who has schizophrenia. Subsequently, we measured (a) causal beliefs on the etiology of schizophrenia (as a manipulation check), (b) the degree of essentialist beliefs (mediator), (c) the extent to which subjects subscribed to assumptions of dangerousness, (d) prognostic pessimism, and (e) desire for social distance. Subjects reported a stronger agreement with the etiology they had been presented. Against our expectations, this did not result in higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes in the biogenetic vignette group. Correspondingly, mediation through essentialism could not be tested. In the psychosocial vignette group, biogenetic causal beliefs were associated with a stronger desire for social distance. Essentialist thinking fully mediated this effect. The evidence we found for the assumptions of the mixed-blessings extended to the psychosocial vignette group only. We explain this by the subjects' different readiness to subscribe to biogenetic and psychosocial causal beliefs. We argue that the same levels of essentialism between the experimental groups contributed to the equal levels of stigmatizing attitudes. This underlines the fundamental importance of essentialism in stigma, going beyond a role in the psychological effects of biogenetic causal models.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s12144-021-01653-3,Stigma; Essentialism; Schizophrenia; Genetics;Schizophrenia;Stereotyping,,

The present research integrated three models - implicit theories, hopelessness theories of depression, and the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat - to shed light on this issue. Study 1 replicated the link between an entity theory and internalizing symptoms by synthesizing multiple datasets (N = 6,910). Study 2 examined potential mechanisms underlying this link using 8-month longitudinal data and 10-day diary reports during the stressful first year of high school (N = 533, 3,199 daily reports).

The aim of this study is to develop a task-sharing psychological counselling intervention for routine treatment of mild to moderate symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety in South Africa, as part of the Health Systems Strengthening in sub-Saharan Africa (ASSET) study. Methods We conducted a review of manuals from seven counselling interventions for depression and anxiety in low- and middle-income countries and two local health system training programmes to gather information on delivery format and common counselling components used across task-sharing interventions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 health workers and 37 pregnant women from four Midwife Obstetric Units in Cape Town to explore perceptions and needs relating to mental health. Stakeholder engagements further informed the intervention design and appropriate service provider. A four-day pilot training with community-based health workers refined the counselling content and training material. Results The manual review identified problem-solving, psychoeducation, basic counselling skills and behavioural activation as common counselling components across interventions using a variety of delivery formats. The interviews found that participants mostly identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in behavioural terms, and lay health workers and pregnant women demonstrated their understanding through a range of local idioms. Perceived causes of symptoms related to interpersonal conflict and challenging social circumstances. Stakeholder engagements identified a three-session counselling model as most feasible for delivery as part of existing health care practices and community health workers in ward-based outreach teams as the best placed delivery agents. Pilot training of a three-session intervention with community-based health workers resulted in minor adaptations of the counselling assessment method. Conclusion Input from health workers and pregnant women is a critical component of adapting existing maternal mental health protocols to the context of routine care in South Africa, providing valuable data to align therapeutic content with contextual needs. Multisector stakeholder engagements is vital to align the intervention design to health system requirements and guidelines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s13033-021-00443-5,Perinatal; Depression; Anxiety; Task-sharing; Psychological intervention; Primary health care; Low; and middle-income countries;South Africa;Anxiety,,

Evidence shows the onset of significant degrees of mental illnesses is detectable in this age range. For such early identification to be made there should be a system responding to those needs. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the extent to which the education system is responsive to the psychosocial and mental health needs of children in primary schools through putting appropriate professionals in place, raising teachers' awareness and putting in place viable policies and guidelines. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted in public and private primary schools in Gondar city Data was collected through focus group discussions from seventeen participants drawn from both schools and key informant interviews with two experts from the zonal Department of Education. A thematic qualitative data analysis was employed. Themes were identified with the help of the Nvivo 12 plus software. Results: We found teachers' mental health awareness is very low with parameters such as magnitude, case identification and support. There is an exception in terms of causal attributions of mental illness that matches with scientific literature. Psychosocial support and mental health resources are not available and schools do not provide capacity building mental health trainings for teachers which might help them to identify, handle and make referrals of mental health cases. We also found the Ethiopian education policy and other guidelines do not address the issue of mental health at primary school level. Conclusion: The Ethiopian education system is not responsive to the psychosocial and mental health needs of children in primary schools.

However, most work has relied on body mass index (BMI) and examination of a single mental health variable. The present study examined associations of BMI and waist circumference with multiple mental health variables in a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample. Methods: Nursing staff measured waist circumference and calculated the BMI of 742 adults (54.6\% female, 45.4\% male) presenting for psychiatric treatment. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-24), and Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) as part of standard clinical monitoring. Suicide risk was assessed using the clinician-administered Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.). For curve fit estimation regression models, we entered BMI and waist circumference as independent variables separately; we entered seven dependent variables separately: 1) depression, 2) anxiety, 3) substance use, 4) self-harm, 5) interpersonal functioning, 6) well-being, and 7) suicide risk. Results: Increased BMI was associated with decreased well-being and increased depression. Increased waist circumference was associated with worse interpersonal functioning. Non-linear (quadratic) associations were observed between weight and depression, substance use, self-harm, and suicide. Limitations: Most of the sample was White and only 2.6\% was in the underweight category, limiting broad applicability of findings. Cross-sectional design precludes causal attributions. Conclusions: Given associations between well-being, depression, interpersonal functioning, substance use, self-harm, and suicide with weight, findings may be used to inform mental health treatment, particularly by tailoring interventions to high-risk weight categories (underweight, obese) in psychiatric populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.029,Body Weight,,

Results: Most students experienced symptoms of being anxious, fatigue, headaches and feelings of hopelessness. They labeled these symptoms like anxiety or stress. The most commonly reported causal explanations were psychosocial factors. Students perceived that their anxiety or stress was severe that mainly affected their mind, which in turn impacted their interactions with others, academic result, emotions and motivation to study. Almost all the students received care from informal sources, although they wanted to receive care from mental health professionals.

In the present study, the primary null hypothesis was that there are no factors associated with patient-reported symptom duration (in months). The secondary null hypotheses were that there are no factors independently associated with (1) a sudden versus gradual perception of disease onset, (2) an event or injury-related versus age-related perceived cause of disease onset, and (3) the magnitude of physical limitations. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 121 patients with an atraumatic, established, gradual-onset condition of the upper extremity completed a demographic questionnaire, measures of mental health (symptoms of depression and anxiety, worst-case thinking, and self-efficacy {[}the ability to adapt and continue with daily activity] when in pain), measurement of the magnitude of upper extremity-specific limitations, and questions about the perceived course and cause of the disease. Results: The median patient-reported symptom duration was 12 months (interquartile range, 3 to 36 months). Twenty-two patients (18\%) perceived their disease as new, and 29 patients (24\%) believed that the condition was related to >= 1 event (injury) rather than being time and age-related. In multivariable analysis, patients with Medicare insurance were independently associated with longer reported symptom duration (in months). Greater self-efficacy was associated with longer symptom duration in bivariate, but not multivariable, analysis. No factors were independently associated with a sudden versus gradual onset of symptoms. Hispanic ethnicity and federal, county, or no insurance were independently associated with the perception that the problem was caused by an injury or event. Conclusions: Approximately 1 in 5 patients misperceived new symptoms as representing a new disease, often as a type of injury. Misperception of the pathology as new had a limited association with unhealthy thoughts and is likely generally responsive to reorientation. We speculate that gentle, strategic reorientation of misperception can protect patients from choices inconsistent with their values.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.2106/JBJS.20.00420,"",,

More negative or threatening illness perceptions were correlated with greater negative, general and overall symptom severity in psychosis. Psychological formulations and interventions for Black people experiencing psychosis should consider personalised beliefs about their mental health problems as this may facilitate improvements in symptoms.

The survey explored mental health attributions for depression, alcohol use disorder, and schizophrenia. Results: Attributions differed significantly by disorder. Depression and alcohol use were attributed to social stress and perceived as controllable and influenced by personal weakness and lifestyle choices. Schizophrenia was often attributed to hereditary/biological causes. Differences also emerged based on the participants' acculturation, region of origin, and religiosity.

But apart from perceiving them as potential barriers, they can also play an important role in stimulating individuals to consult (in)formal help sources, in particular through the process of help referral. Where existing research mainly focusses on actual help seeking behaviour, this study will focus on lay publics' referral behaviour. Aims: This study analyses the relation between causal beliefs and stigmatising attitudes and social distance on the one hand, and (in)formal help seeking recommendations on the other. Methods: Data from a survey carried out in 2019, assessing the attitudes of Public Health Insurance Provider (HIP) members towards mental health problems, was used. Part of the survey questions was based on a quantitative quasi-experimental design, using hypothetical written vignettes. The weighted data represent a sample of the adult Flemish population (22-94 years, N = 5675). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the relation between causal beliefs and stigma, while binominal logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relation between causal beliefs and help seeking recommendations. Results: The results reveal that causal beliefs significantly associate with stigma, measured by stigmatising attitudes and social distance: personal- or biogenetic beliefs associate with more stigma, where psychosocial beliefs associate with less stigma. Concerning help seeking recommendations, psychosocial beliefs associate with recommending psychological or psychotherapeutic care, biogenetic beliefs associate with advising help from general practitioners and suggesting psychiatric help, while personal beliefs negatively associate with recommending formal help. Meanwhile, biogenetic beliefs associate with less informal help seeking recommendations (e.g. family, friends and online self-help), where personal beliefs associate with more informal help seeking recommendations and psychosocial beliefs only associate with online help referral. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of causal beliefs in affecting public stigma and help seeking recommendations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0020764020973249,Public opinion survey; mental health problems; causal beliefs; public stigma; help seeking recommendations;Causality,,

First, statistical and theoretical models are conflated, leading to invalid inferences such as the existence of psychological constructs based on factor models, or recommendations for clinical interventions based on network models. I demonstrate this inferential gap in a simulation: excellent model fit does little to corroborate a theory, regardless of quality or quantity of data. Second, researchers fail to explicate theories about psychological constructs, but use implicit causal beliefs to guide inferences. These latent theories have led to problematic best practices. Third, explicated theories are often weak theories: imprecise descriptions vulnerable to hidden assumptions and unknowns. Such theories do not offer precise predictions, and it is often unclear whether statistical effects actually corroborate weak theories or not. I demonstrate that these three challenges are common and harmful, and impede theory formation, failure, and reform.

Each mother received eight weekly 90-minute PFI sessions without the child present. Findings demonstrated significant decreases in parent ratings of problem behavior as well as observed child problem behavior for all three families, though visual analysis showed only modest change in parent-reported problem behavior for one of those three mothers, and direct observation data was only collected pre- and post-intervention. Two of the three mothers reported significant decreases in dysfunctional child- and parent-causal attributions, irrational beliefs, and pessimistic thoughts.

Methods: : Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched multiple electronic databases for articles: (i) reporting original data published in English in peer-reviewed journals, (ii) reporting quantitative data with statistical analysis, (iii) assessing stigma in a broad sense, and (iv) including samples composed only of MHP. Results: : A total of 38 articles published from 1999 to 2019 and involving 10,926 MHP fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Studies showed that schizophrenia is the most stigmatized mental illnesses in MHP, despite recent results suggesting that borderline personality disorder and substance abuse may be more stigmatized. In comparison with other social groups, MHP reported less dangerousness beliefs and more positive beliefs regarding pharmacological treatment.

Beliefs about the cause of physical symptoms are considered particularly important among those with medically unexplained symptoms and illnesses (MUS); yet little is known about causal beliefs among those with the most severe MUS (i.e., Veterans). The goal of the current study was to examine Veteran's causal attributions of their physical symptoms. Method A total of 91 combat Veterans with MUS were surveyed using a mixed-methods design about the cause of their physical symptoms, physical symptom severity, and PTSD symptoms. Causal attributions of physical symptoms were analyzed through thematic response analysis and grouped into categories. Chi-square analysis was used to assess the distribution of causal attribution types across Veterans with varying physical symptom severity and PTSD symptom severity. Results Veterans with MUS reported an average of 7.9 physical symptoms, and attributed the cause of their symptoms to seven different categories ({''}Do not Know,{''} ``Stress/Mental Health,{''} ``Deployment/Environment,{''} ``Functional/Symptom,{''} ``Medically Explained,{''} ``Medically Unexplained Syndrome,{''} and ``Lifestyle{''}). Exploratory chi-square analysis revealed significant differences in causal attributions across physical symptom severity and severity of PTSD symptoms. Veterans with more severe PTSD and Veterans with more severe physical symptoms were more likely to attribute their MUS to stress/mental health or to a medically unexplained syndrome compared with those with low/no PTSD symptoms and physical symptom severity. Veterans with minimal PTSD and Veterans with minimal physical symptom severity were more likely to attribute the cause of their MUS to lifestyle choices (e.g., exercise/diet) compared with those with high PTSD and physical symptom severity.

The reasons for negative attitudes are not consistent across communities or cultures. Therefore, understanding the level of community perception and attitude towards people with depression is important to develop an intervention to reduce the impact of mental illness. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly selected adults. The data was collected using structured, pre-tested, and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics like frequency, mean, and median were performed. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors that affect the community attitude towards people with depression. RESULTS: Of the study population, 325(52.7\%) had a good perception and 246(39.9\%) had a positive attitude towards people with depression. The majority of study participants frequently identified as the perceived cause of depression was substance misuse, loss of loved one, and conflict within a family. In addition, psychosocial treatment was the most preferred treatment for people with depression in the study area. Marital status and educational status were significantly associated with the community attitude towards people with depression CONCLUSION: Giving special attention to people with substance misuse, loss of loved one, and conflict within a family is very vital for the prevention of depression.

Prior research in northern Rwanda documented common local concepts of distress for the population that cannot receive assistance despite severe adversities; however, the locally-perceived causes, manifestation and coping strategies and their associations are still unclear. Methods The qualitative study in the Musanze district, northern Rwanda, was informed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. In-depth interviews were conducted with people with lived experience and those in close contact with people with lived experience of distress. Ethnographic observation was conducted and the analyses were complimented by an earlier ethnography in the same village. Results Study participants (n=15) included community members with lived experience of mental distress and/or those with close friends or family with lived experience. The perceived manifestations of the mental distresses were diverse and the causal attributions shifted from more social, concrete and explainable (eg, loss) towards magical, more abstract and unexplainable (eg, poisoning). Finally, participants sought coping strategies in accordance with their causal attribution in ways that made sense to them. Conclusion The coping strategies were chosen according to the perceived aetiology of the symptoms and they were perceived to be effective for their distress. Local coping strategies that match people's help-seeking patterns should therefore be supported in policy and programmes.

Different cultural belief systems on the causes of mental illness and their treatment have to be taken into consideration. The purpose of this study is to explore perceived causes of depression among Farsi-speaking migrants and refugees from Afghanistan and Iran, which represent two groups with a shared cultural heritage, but originating from very different regimes of mobility. Both are among the largest migrant groups coming to Germany over the past decade. Design/methodology/approach In total, 50 Iranian and 50 Afghan migrants and refugees, who arrived in Germany in the past 10 years were interviewed, using an unlabeled vignette presenting signs and symptoms of depression. The answers were then coded through inductive content analysis. Findings Among Iranians, there was a more significant number of causal attribution to Western psychiatric concepts, whereas Afghans attributed depression more often to the experience of being a refugee without referring to psychological concepts. These differences in attribution did, however, not affect the desire for a social distance toward depressed people. Nonetheless, a higher number of years spent in Germany was associated with less desire for social distance toward persons with depression among Afghans, but not among Iranians. Originality/value To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study examining perceived causes of depression with Farsi-speaking migrants in Germany and contributes to understanding tendencies in the perception of depression in non-Western migrant groups.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1108/IJMHSC-03-2019-0036,Refugees; Explanatory models; Depression; Stigma; Causal attribution; Psychologization;Social Desirability;Germany;Iran,,

Disruptive autistic behaviors (described via vignettes) evoked more stigma than withdrawn behaviors. Perceived dangerousness predicted autism stigma. Greater acceptance of inequality, less openness, and lower cognitive empathy co-occurred with heightened stigma towards most conditions.

Limited research has been conducted in Africa to investigate this relation. Method In the present study, using focus group discussions, we explored the relation between genetic attribution and stigma among 36 Xhosa people with schizophrenia. We addressed three main questions: (1) What causal beliefs do Xhosa people with schizophrenia use to explain their illness and to what extent do genetic explanations play a role in these beliefs? (2) What are the internalised stigma experiences of Xhosa people with schizophrenia? (3) How do genetic explanations relate to stigma experiences, if at all? Results Most participants were able to define genetics and some linked genetics to disease causation. Despite adequate knowledge of genetics and an emphasis on genetic explanations of schizophrenia in the study, most participants held a multitude of causal explanations including: psychosocial, environmental, and cultural. Moreover, participants rarely mentioned disease cause when describing their stigma experiences. Discussion For this population group, there was no straight-forward relation between a genetic attribution and stigma. Therefore, we did not find evidence that genetic attribution may significantly increase stigma. Although North American and European literature provides conflicting evidence regarding this relation, there is increased consensus that biomedical explanations for psychiatric disorders may reduce blame. This study found evidence supporting that consensus. This study provides an empirical foundation to inform ongoing work on the psychosocial implications of psychiatric genomics research in non-Western contexts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00127-020-01875-z,Genetic attribution; Schizophrenia; Stigma; Xhosa people;Schizophrenia;South Africa,,

Does the therapist use triadic explanations of psychopathology as suggested by her approach? And do clients resort almost exclusively to monadic and dyadic explanations as did the university students in our previous study? What kind of explanations do they propose? The coding system ``1 to 3: from the monad to the triad{''} was applied to the transcripts of 25 individual systemic therapies conducted by the same therapist. This manual allows coding of the inference field of symptom explanations according to three categories: monadic, dyadic, and triadic. These three broad categories are also used to analyze the etiopathogenetic content of each explanation: traumatic, intrapersonal, and interpersonal. Our findings showed that clients and their therapist actually used different inference fields: clients resorted almost exclusively to monadic and dyadic explanations, whereas their therapist included the triadic explanatory level. Moreover, the therapist provided more interpersonal explanations than her clients. Hence, the dissonance between client and therapist about the inference fields - a crucial premise of one of the most accepted ideas of therapeutic change according to systemic therapies - is proven, at least among our participants. Thanks to this dissonance, clients and therapists can create a new story, potentially able to change clients' feelings, without disconfirming their emotions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00597,triadic thinking; causal explanations; symptoms; mental disorders; therapeutic change; systemic psychotherapy; psychopathology; attributions;Thinking,,

The commonsense model (CSM) provides a nuanced framework for studying illness beliefs as shaped by experience. Aims: ET-informed hypotheses linking causal and prognostic beliefs and stigmatizing attitudes concerning depression were tested using CSM constructs with a focus on the moderating effects of self-reported experience with this disorder. Methods: U.S. adults (N = 319) completed online questionnaires assessing depression-related beliefs, attitudes and experience. Multiple regression analysis focused on predictive effects of neurobiological and genetic attributions. Potential mediators (prognosis) and moderators (experience) of the biological attribution-stigma link also were tested. Results: Neurobiological attributions predicted viewing depression as more consequential, longer lasting, and unexpectedly, more treatable. Neurobiological attributions were inversely related to stigma, a link partially mediated by beliefs about depression's consequences and duration. However, both biological attributions' relationships to stigma were moderated by experience. Stronger biological attributions predicted less stigma specifically among participants reporting first- or second-hand experience with depression. Conclusion: Experience with depression may shape the relationships of specific causal and prognostic beliefs with depression stigma.

However, there has been scant attention paid to practices at the interface of clinicians and carers, namely foster carers and residential carers. The present study considers child and adolescent self-harm management and prevention practices as a site of empirical interest due to reports that multi-agency teams are not effectively operating. Drawing upon a grounded theory approach, data were generated via semi-structured interviews and focus groups with residential carers (n = 15) and foster carers (n = 15) in Wales. Themes were developed through axial coding. The results present two central themes to explain the nature and perceived causes of inter-professional discord. First, there are clear contestations in expertise, with carers challenging clinicians' propositional knowledge in favour of their own experiential expertise. However, participants simultaneously endorse medical dominance, which contributes to their sense of disempowerment and marginalisation. Second, is the preclusion of carers' professional identity, primarily due to inadequate professionalisation procedures. Meanwhile, the privileging of their parenting role is perceived to support the perpetuation of courtesy stigma. Carers are then compelled to undertake the effortful labour of legitimisation. Together these thematic insights provide direction on mechanisms to improve inter-professional interactions, notably around training and accreditation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not sure what this is talking about",10.1111/1467-9566.13071,Qualitative; Self-harm; Interprofessional Practice; Interprofessional Education;Professional Practice;Adolescent;Foster Home Care;Caregivers,,

This article aims to explore cultural understanding and care-seeking behavior among caregivers of psychotic patients in Java, Indonesia. Data for this article have been taken from two studies conducted by our research group in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Methods of data collection include surveys, case studies, ethnographic fieldwork, and in-depth interviews. Results of analyses, within and across studies, indicate that caregivers have employed diverse cultural explanatory models in order to understand psychotic illness. Local cultural beliefs, including possession and forms of black magic, were among the most common initial concepts held by family members in relation to psychosis. This echoes broader cultural beliefs in Java. However, it was not uncommon for caregivers to also understand illness in psychological terms (such as frustration, disappointment, and stress) and attached medical explanations. Caregivers' understanding of illness also changed over time following the changing course of the illness. Both models of illness and the rapidity of care-seeking are also related to the acuteness of onset. This article concludes that it is important for mental health providers, as well as those designing systems of care, to understand the diversity and changing nature of caregivers' cultural understanding of psychotic illness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1177/1363461520916290,care seeking; explanatory model; Java-Indonesia; mental illness,,

METHOD The study sample consisted of 20 patients with an average age of 60 years, who had received radiotherapy for cancer of various sites at a public oncology hospital in Athens. The data collection was based on semi-structured interviews, and thematic analysis was the method used to analyze the qualitative research data. RESULTS From the thematic analysis of the interview data, 4 major themes and 12 individual subthemes emerged. The first theme related to the attitudes of the patients towards the disease, and specifically, supportive relationships, an optimistic view, and denial of the disease. The second theme concerned the representation of the disease, as related to the patients' causal attributions. The subthemes that emerged were the disease as message from God, the disease as a random event, and personal responsibility for the occurrence of the disease. The third theme covered faith, which appeared to be a pillar in the efforts of the patients to cope with the upcoming difficulties, and in which the subthemes were faith in God, religious practices, and empowerment of faith during the disease. The fourth theme focused on the changes experienced by the patients throughout the course of the disease, with subthemes concerning the benefits of the traumatic experience, changes in priorities, and the perception of mortality. CONCLUSIONS Faith emerged as one of the most important aspects of the cancer experience, from which patients could derive strength and optimism. The majority of participants referred to belief in God, but a few, more vaguely, mentioned non-religious faith. Based on these findings, it appears that facing a life-threatening disease often leads patients to consider their lives in a more favorable light. The patients reported positive changes in the way they live and reported that they attached importance to more significant issues as a result of the experience. Spirituality and meaning-making appear to be very important aspects of the patients' experience of cancer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",,Cancer patients; Meaning making; Qualitative research; Spirituality; Thematic analysis,,

The causal explanations of people who experience psychosis have been under-researched, and, if they diverge from the dominant bio-genetic paradigm, can be dismissed as `lack of insight'. 701 people, from 30 countries, who completed an online survey about their experiences on antipsychotics, answered an open question about what had caused the problems for which they had been prescribed the drugs. On a `Bio-Social' likert scale, from 1 = `Purely Biological' to 5 = `Purely Social', the mean score was 4.24.

Identifying characteristics of parents who believe in a causal role of vaccines for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in their child may help targeting educational activities and improve adherence to the immunization schedule. Objectives: To compare caregivers of children with ASD who agree or disagree that vaccines play an etiological role in autism for 1) socio-demographics characteristics and 2) developmental and clinical profiles of their children. Methods: Data from 16,525 participants with ASD under age 18 were obtained from SPARK, a national research cohort started in 2016. Caregivers completed questionnaires at registration that included questions on beliefs about the etiologic role of childhood immunizations and other factors in ASD. Data were available about family socio-demographic characteristics, first symptoms of autism, developmental regression, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, seizures, and current levels of functioning. Results: Participants with ASD were 80.4\% male with a mean age of 8.1 years (SD = 4.1). Overall, 16.5\% of caregivers endorsed immunizations as perceived causes of autism. Compared to caregivers who disagreed with vaccines as a cause for ASD, those who believed in vaccine causation came disproportionately from ethnic minority, less educated, and less wealthy backgrounds. More often their children had experienced developmental regression involving language and other skills, were diagnosed earlier, had lost skills during the second year of life, and had worse language, adaptive, and cognitive outcomes. Conclusion: One in six caregivers who participate in a national research cohort believe that child immunizations could be a cause of autism in their child. Parent social background (non-White, less educated) and child developmental features (regression in second year, poorer language skills, and worse adaptive outcomes) index caregivers who are more likely to harbor these beliefs and could benefit from targeted educational activities.

Agreement was significantly more pronounced in case of a person with fatigue and an earlier severe somatic disease. A quarter endorsed lack of willpower as a possible cause. Lack of willpower was associated with a significant increase of desire for social distance in both vignettes. Work stress was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of positively evaluating the effectiveness of psychotherapy in both cases of SSD. Conclusions: Public beliefs about causes of SSD are associated with stigma and treatment beliefs. Emphasising work stress as a cause may promote the belief that psychotherapy is effective for treatment of SSD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Maybe"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Somatic Symtom Disorder?",10.1016/j.jpsychores.2019.109910,Somatic symptom disorder; Public beliefs; Causal attribution; Stigma; Psychotherapy,,

Where pluralistic attributions for mental health problems predominate, the development of global mental health (GMH) interventions in the form of task-shifting approaches create increased access to new ways of understanding and responding to distress. However, little is known about how participants in these initiatives manage these encounters. This qualitative study in Malawi explored village-based health workers' (HSAs) and patients' and carers' views of the causes of distress and how these beliefs influenced help-seeking and the health workers' response. Eight HSAs and nine paired patients/carers were interviewed separately to enable each of nine experiences of distress to be explored. Findings revealed a complex set of personal, social and cultural influences that informed causative attributions and help-seeking decisions. Patients/carers viewed psychosocial stresses as compelling explanations and readily reported others attributing their distress to supernatural causes (bewitchment). Yet attributional beliefs alone were not the only influence over help-seeking, which evolved pragmatically in response to the impact of treatments and social pressure for conformity. In turn HSAs navigated the interactions with patients/carers by emphasising the biomedical approach and discrediting bewitchment attributions. This caused tensions when biomedical interventions were unhelpful or the traditional healers' approach proved beneficial. Conclusions add to the call for such task-shifting approaches to work with communities to discern authentic and practical responses to mental distress that mirror the `pluralism and pragmatism' found in the communities they serve.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1080/13648470.2018.1507103,Malawi; mental health; causal attributions; help-seeking; traditional beliefs,,

Recent evidence reveals that more than 21 million people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, there is little information about community perception and attitude towards people with Schizophrenia in Ethiopia. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the community perception and attitude towards people with Schizophrenia among residents of Arba Minch Zuria Districts, Southern Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly selected adults. Interviewer-administered standard tool was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics like frequency, mean, and median computed. A binary logistic regression model used to identify factors affecting community perception and attitude towards people with schizophrenia. Results: Of the study population, 469 (76\%) of respondents had good perception and 390 (63.2\%) had positive attitudes towards people with schizophrenia. The study participants identified talkativeness and self-neglect behaviors as the most common manifestations of schizophrenia. Besides, this study identified substance misuse and head injury as the perceived cause and spiritual or traditional methods as a preferred treatment for people with schizophrenia. Moreover, the study participants preferred spiritual or traditional methods for the treatment of schizophrenia. Young age {[}AOR=2.03, 95\% CI: 1.21, 3.40], females {[}AOR=2.32, 95\% CI: 1.58, 3.41], good perception towards people with schizophrenia {[}AOR=4.95, 95\% CI: 3.25, 7.54] and no formal educational status {[}AOR=2.75, 95\% CI: 1.33, 5.70], and primary education {[}AOR=3.72, 95\% CI: 1.87, 7.39] were significantly associated with the attitude towards people with schizophrenia. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that approximately one-third of the residents had unfavorable attitudes towards people with schizophrenia. Therefore, giving special attention to male, elders and those who were educated, and individuals who have poor perceptions of people with schizophrenia is crucial.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.2147/RMHP.S241713,perception; attitude; schizophrenia; Arba Minch Zuria District; Southern Ethiopia;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section;Schizophrenia,,

Looking at the symptomatology of first-visit patients with MDD in different mental health services, and identifying predictors of health-seeking behavior using machine learning may help to improve diagnostic accuracy. Methods: 1500 patients first diagnosed with MDD were recruited from 16 psychiatric hospitals and 16 general hospitals across China. Socio-demographic characteristics, causal attribution, symptoms of depression within and outside Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) framework were collected using a self-made questionnaire. A predictive model of 62 variables was established using Random forest, symptom frequencies of patients in general hospitals and psychiatric hospitals were compared. Results: The machine learning approach revealed that symptoms were strong predictors of health-seeking behavior among patients with MDD. General hospitals patients had higher frequencies of suicidal ideation (chi(2) =15.230, p < 0.001), psychosis (chi(2) =14.264, p < 0.001), weight change (all p < 0.001), hypersomnia (chi(2) = 25.940, p< 0.001), and a tendency of denying emotional/cognitive symptoms compared with psychiatric hospitals patients. Limitations: Stigma and preference bias were not measured. Severity of current depressive episodes was not assessed. Data of previous episode(s) was not presented. Conclusions: Symptom evaluation targeting specific patient population in different hospitals is crucial for diagnostic accuracy.

Low-income families are a subset of consumers who frequently require services within these settings yet also may face providers who are not optimally supportive. One factor that interferes with providers' ability to engage in empathic, well-informed, and effective advocacy is their underlying attributions about causes of poverty that overemphasize personal responsibility. The current studies examined whether a poverty simulation training would be sufficient to modify participants' poverty attributions. Undergraduate participants in Study 1 (N = 126, Mean age = 21.6, SD = 5.6) were significantly more likely to emphasize external causes of poverty following the simulation. In Study 2, social service providers (N = 98, Mean age = 38.58, SD = 11.56) reported lower internal beliefs following participation in a poverty simulation but did not shift to a predominantly external belief index. The results of these studies demonstrate that causal attributions of poverty within both student and professional samples can be modified by participation in a poverty simulation. Because these attributions have important implications for advocacy work with consumers and efforts to address poverty, the poverty simulation experience has the potential to be an effective training tool that could yield real-world impact.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1037/ser0000348,poverty; simulation; attributions; advocacy; public service;Poverty,,

As anxiety was chosen to be one of the constructs in RDoC, the present study aimed to compare different anxiety improvement pattern in clinical setting, because this was important for developing treatment strategies of anxiety under RDoC frame. The study compared potential differences in trajectory of anxiety symptoms improvement in patients with various diagnoses receiving attribution retraining group therapy (ARGT) and those undergoing first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in clinical care setting. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to ARGT (n = 63) or SSRI group (n = 66) group. Patients receiving ARGT had one session per week for 8 weeks. Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) was measured at 5 sequential time points during treatment. Results: The results for the HAMA total scores showed only time effect was significant, showing that no significant differences in HAMA total score between ARGT and SSRI. Additionally, both groups over time reduced HAMA score significantly. Conclusions: The results of the subscales analyses showed that both SSRI and ARGT group had effectively reduced anxiety symptoms. ARGT preferentially targeted on depressive symptoms and behaviour at interview. SSRI preferentially targeted on anxious emotions. Sequences of symptom improvement of two groups were different. Both ARGT and SSRI can effectively reduce anxiety symptoms of patients.

We know little about older Latinx adults' perceived causes of mental health problems, offering clinicians limited insight to guide successful and culturally congruent treatment. Moreover, there is a paucity of mental health research examining heterogeneity in how Latinx individuals may attribute mental health symptoms. The present study sought to identify how Latinx and non-Latinx older adults attributed the sources of their mental health problems and how these types of attributions differ by ethnicity. Research Design and Methods: This study analyzed data collected from a retrospective chart review and survey of 673 adults aged 55-95 years (430 Mexican origin and 244 non-Latinx) from a rural psychiatric outpatient clinic near the California-Mexico border. We conducted stratified latent class analysis (LCA) by race/ethnicity to explore the mental health attribution beliefs of Mexican-origin and non-Latinx clinic patients. Results: Different LCA patterns for Mexican-origin Latinx versus non-Latinx groups were found. For non-Latinx adults, there was a class of individuals who attributed their mental health issues to social and financial problems. For Mexicanorigin adults, there was a class of individuals who attributed their mental health issues to spiritual and/or supernatural factors, unaffected by acculturation level, depressive symptom severity, and time spent in the United States, but differing by gender. We found within-group heterogeneity: Not all Mexican-origin or non-Latinx older adults were alike in how they conceptualized their mental health. Discussion and Implications: Mexican-origin Latinx and non-Latinx older adults attributed their mental health issues to different causes. More Mexican-origin older adults attributed their symptoms to spiritual causes, even after controlling for contextual factors. Further research is needed to determine whether attribution beliefs are affected by specific mental health diagnoses and other cultural factors not measured in this study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1093/geroni/igaa028,Ethnicity; Latent class analysis; Mental health symptoms; Quantitative;Mental Health,,

The reluctance to seek professional help could be due to misconceptions about the causes of mental illnesses. Research has shown that help-seeking attitudes can predict actual service use. As young adults are most at risk of developing mental illnesses, this study aims to elucidate the impact of causal beliefs about mental illness on help-seeking attitudes among university students in Singapore. Design Prior to attending an anti-stigma intervention, data on the Causal Beliefs about Mental Illness, Inventory of Attitudes towards Seeking Mental Health services and questions pertaining to sociodemographic background were collected from participants using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions were performed to examine the relationship between causal beliefs and help-seeking, as well as their sociodemographic correlates. Settings A university in Singapore. Participants 390 students who were studying in a University in Singapore. Results Younger age was associated with higher scores on psychosocial attribution, while prior social contact with individuals with mental illness was significantly associated with lower scores on personality attribution. With regard to help-seeking attitudes; being a male and personality attribution were significantly associated with lower scores on `Psychological Openness' and `Indifference to Stigma', while psychosocial attribution was significantly associated with higher scores on `Help-seeking Propensity'. Having prior social contact also predicted higher `Psychological Openness', while being in Year 2 and 3 predicted lower scores on `Indifference to Stigma'. Conclusion Findings from this study suggest that help-seeking attitudes might be influenced by causal beliefs, with personality attribution being the most impairing. Hence, to reduce the wide treatment gap in Singapore, anti-stigma interventions targeting young people could focus on addressing beliefs that attribute mental illness to the personality of the individual.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035818,psychiatry; mental health; epidemiology;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,

Recommended response to psychological distress in humanitarian crises is still based on frameworks for interventions developed in western/European contexts including psychological first aid, counselling and group therapy. While there is growing, but limited, evidence that culturally modified interventions can lead to reduction in symptoms of psychological distress in conflict affected populations, there is a need to understand mental health help-seeking behaviour and mental health service needs from the perspective of affected communities. Methods This study employed a qualitative exploratory research design based on principles of grounded theory. A combination of convenience and snowball sampling was used to recruit 186 adults from the general population to 20 focus group discussions; 95 men, median age 40 years, interquartile range (IQR): 27-48 years and 91 women, median age 40 years IQR: 32-50 years. Trained Kashmiri facilitators used a semi-structured interview guide to ascertain community perceptions on mental illness, help-seeking and service needs from the perspective of communities in the Kashmir Valley. Content analysis of transcripts resulted in the identification of seven overarching themes. Results Common locally recognized symptoms of psychological distress were synonymous with symptoms listed in the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-25) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Protracted political insecurity was highlighted as a major perceived cause of psychological distress in communities. Mental health help-seeking included traditional/spiritual healers in combination with practitioners of western medicine, with access highlighted as the main barrier. Divergent views were expressed on the effectiveness of treatment received. Participants' expressed the need for investment in mental health literacy to improve the community's capacity to recognize and support those suffering from psychological distress. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the universality of symptoms of psychological distress whilst simultaneously highlighting the importance of recognizing the cultural, spiritual and contextual framework within which psychological distress is understood and manifest.

However, researchers have hypothesized that the content of the voice-hearing experience and its cultural context are relevant to stigma responses. This study experimentally tested how perceptions of voice-hearing experiences change as a function of the voice's content and the perceiver's characteristics. Method: In total, 143 nonclinical participants were presented with vignettes describing people who heard voices that were attributed to either ``God{''} or ``Abraham Lincoln{''} and were described as either complimentary/encouraging or insulting/threatening. For each vignette, participants were asked about the likelihood that the voice-hearer had schizophrenia or mental illness. The Causal Beliefs Questionnaire was also delivered, with two new subscales added to test for belief in positive and negative religious causes for the voices. Stigma was measured by perceived dangerousness and desire for social distance. Results: Voice-hearing experiences elicited greater stigma from participants who endorsed greater likelihood that the voice-hearer was mentally ill, greater belief in biological causes of the voice-hearing, negative religious causes, psychosocial causes, socialization causes, and causes related to personal responsibility. Endorsing positive religious causes was associated with lower stigma. Participants who were more religious were more likely to attribute voice-hearing experiences to negative religious causes (possession, lack of/misguided faith), except when the target was described as hearing the voice of God saying positive things. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The stigma of voice-hearing experiences depends upon what the voice is saying and perceptions about the cause of the voice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1037/prj0000353,voice-hearing; stigma; psychosis; social functioning; schizophrenia,,

Veterans completed a psychiatric interview and self-report measures of demographics, military experience, and levels of religiousness. They completed self-report scales assessing levels of r/s struggle across different domains (i.e. divine, demonic, interpersonal, moral, doubt, ultimate meaning), provided open-ended descriptions of r/s struggles that were coded for these domains, and reported on a variety of characteristics related to their r/s struggle (e.g., duration, course, perceived cause, perceived impact on life, spiritual growth/decline resulting from the r/s struggle). Descriptive results from quantitative and qualitative data showed that Veterans perceived r/s struggles, particularly moral struggles, as salient and impactful. Veterans reported substantial positive effects and small negative effects of r/s struggles on their psychological and r/s functioning. Higher perceived negative effects were related to higher levels of r/s struggle domains. Statistical analyses comparing levels of r/s struggles and r/s struggle attributes across sample characteristics (e.g., demographics, psychiatric diagnosis, military experience) showed that, after controlling for religiousness, older age showed a positive association with positive perceived adaptation to r/s struggles, whereas the presence of a mental disorder and distressing military experiences showed associations with negative perceived adaptation.

At extreme levels, MPA can impair the career and quality of life. Our goal is to describe the clinical profile, perceived causes and coping strategies associated with MPA. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, several self-assessment instruments were administered to a sample of 214 Brazilian musicians (68\% male, 53.3\% classical/46.7\% popular musicians). Data were analyzed using descriptive and parametric statistics, based on the variables of musical training and level of MPA. Results: Percentages of indicators of pathology were high (40\% high MPA levels, 37\% social anxiety, 12.5\% depression, 13.5\% alcohol abuse), and musicians with high MPA levels were the most affected. A wide variety of situations were associated with MPA, especially those related to the individual (pressure from self/concern about audience). Emotion-focused coping and internal resources were prominent among the resources used for coping with MPA (breathing, increased practice, familiarization with performance venue), although they were not always effective. It was relatively uncommon for musicians to seek specialized resources and treatments. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the vulnerability of the targeted professional groups and the need for preventive strategies and behavioral, environmental, educational, and pharmacological interventions to change this scenario.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1590/2237-6089-2018-0104,Anxiety; music performance; coping strategies; musicians; psychopathology;Anxiety;Music,,

To address this gap in the literature, this study focuses on religious cultural values reported by Mexican American college women and how sociocultural factors, such as spiritual and biological etiology beliefs and self-stigma, can shape their willingness to seek counseling, using the cultural influences on mental health (CIMH) theoretical framework (Hwang, Myers, Abe-Kim, \& Ting, 2008).

EMs serve to capture patients' personal illness narratives and can help reveal how culture influences these narratives. While much research has aimed to understand EMs in the Western hemisphere, less research has been done on other cultures. Therefore, we investigated local causal attributions for mental illness in Cuba because of its particular history and political system. Although Cuban culture shares many values with Latin American cultures because of Spanish colonization, it is unique because of its socialist political and economic context, which might influence causal attributions. Thus, we developed a qualitative interview outline based on the Clinical Ethnographic Interview and administered interviews to 14 psychiatric patients in Havana. We conducted a thematic analysis to identify repeated patterns of meaning. Six patterns of causal attribution for mental illness were identified: (1) Personal shortcomings, (2) Family influences, (3) Excessive demands, (4) Cultural, economic, and political environment in Cuba, (5) Physical causes, and (6) Symptom-related explanations. In our sample, we found general and Cuba-specific patterns of causal attributions, whereby the Cuba-specific themes mainly locate the causes of mental illness outside the individual. These findings might be related to Cubans' socio-centric personal orientation, the cultural value of familismo and common daily experiences within socialist Cuban society. We discuss how the findings may be related to social stigma and help-seeking behavior.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1177/1363461519853649,Explanatory model; causal attribution; mental illness; Cuba; qualitative study; thematic analysis;Cuba;Mentally Ill Persons,,

Causal attributions for mental illness have numerous attitudinal and behavioural consequences; however, limited research has explored their implications for attitudes to treatment. This study experimentally investigates the impact of causal attributions for depression on attitudes to specific help-seeking and treatment options. Methods: In an online study, 196 participants read a vignette that emphasised either biological, social or biopsychosocial causes of a character's depression. Participants rated several help-seeking and treatment options on how helpful or harmful they would be for the individual described in the vignette and for themselves personally. Results: The causal attribution manipulation significantly affected treatment attitudes. Relative to social attributions, emphasising biological causes of depression significantly decreased the perceived helpfulness of life-style-based treatments, but did not affect attitudes to psychotherapeutic or medical treatment options. Participants rated most help-seeking and treatment options as less helpful for themselves compared to the vignette character. Participants with personal experience of depression had lower confidence in informal sources of help-seeking and greater confidence in medical treatment. Limitations:Limitations include reliance on self-report measures and low reliability of certain sub-scales. Conclusions: These findings suggest emphasising the biological underpinnings of depression could deter people from engaging with lifestyle-based treatment options. Promoting biopsychosocial theories of depression could increase awareness about the multifactorial causes of depression without negatively impacting the perceived efficacy of any help-seeking or intervention options.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.jad.2019.07.017,Depression; Causal attributions; Treatment preferences; Help-seeking; Survey;Causality,,

Design and methods Three hundred and five non-psychiatric doctors working in outpatient community centres completed the `Opinions on mental disorders Questionnaire' after reading a clinical description of people with schizophrenia. Results The factors most frequently reported as causes of schizophrenia were heredity (65.2\%) and use of street drugs (54.1\%). Seventy-five per cent of participants endorsed both one or more biological causal factors and one or more psychosocial causal factors. Of the 264 participants who expressed their opinion about the most important cause of schizophrenia, 53.8\% indicated a biogenetic cause. Fifty-two per cent of respondents thought it `completely true' that drugs are useful in schizophrenia, and 33.9\% thought it `completely true' that people with schizophrenia must take drugs all their life. Participants stating that the most important cause was biogenetic more frequently recommended a psychiatrist and less frequently a psychologist. Compared to doctors who indicated a psychosocial cause as the most important one, those who indicated a biogenetic cause were more sceptical about recovery, more confident in the usefulness of drugs, and more convinced of the need of lifelong pharmacological treatments in schizophrenia. Conclusions These findings suggest the need to provide some doctors with training on the multiple, interacting causes of schizophrenia and the efficacy of the broad range of available treatments. The education of health professionals regarding stigma and its effects on clinical practice is also needed. Practitioner points Viewing schizophrenia as mainly due to a biological cause is associated with greater confidence in the usefulness of drugs, higher belief in the need for lifelong pharmacological treatments, and greater prognostic pessimism. Belief in a biologically oriented model of schizophrenia may lead doctors to underestimate the value of psychologists. Prognostic pessimism among doctors may negatively influence clinical decisions, the information doctors provide to their clients, and clients' own beliefs about their chances of recovery. Belief in the need for lifelong pharmacological treatments in schizophrenia may lead doctors to resist drug withdrawal in case of severe side effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1111/papt.12252,beliefs; causal explanations; health professionals; schizophrenia; treatments;Schizophrenia;Prognosis,,

Materials and Methods: Qualitative audio-recorded interviews were conducted with 15 SPS, purposively selected from a tertiary mental health hospital of Southern India. A general inductive approach was adopted to analyze the qualitative data. Results: Four broad themes were identified from qualitative data analysis. (1) SPS described several explanatory models of mental illness in terms of causal attributions and treatment care. (2) They had expressed emotion toward their ill siblings, such as criticality, hostility, and emotional over-involvement. (3) They experienced objective and subjective burden while caring for their ill sibling. In spite of all these, (4) they were part of their ill siblings' care in terms of ensuring regular follow-ups and drug adherence and supported their livelihood. They coped up with adaptive as well as maladaptive strategies. Conclusion: SPS provide significant support to their affected siblings. However, they do have non-biomedical models of mental illness and negative attitudes toward patients and experience burden.

Practitioners of mind-body therapies still disseminate traditional mechanistic explanations such as purification of mental or vital forces.

Objective: The present research examined whether mind-body therapy users exhibit two related forms of magical thinking, including thought-action fusion. Method: Two online, cross-sectional studies with U.S. participants (Study 1 N = 645; Study 2 N = 566) assessed thought-action fusion and magical causal belief, along with mind-body therapy use and potential covariates. Results: The results from Study 1 revealed that thought-action fusion was uniquely associated with mind-body therapy use. This finding was replicated in Study 2, in which thought-action fusion was uniquely associated with past-year mind-body therapy use for psychological reasons and for pain/nausea. Additionally in Study 2, magical causal belief was uniquely associated with past-year use for pain/nausea and for physical disease.

Many people with mental illness do not seek professional help. Beliefs about the causes of their current health problem seem relevant for initiating treatment. Our aim was to find out to what extent the perceived causes of current untreated mental health problems determine whether a person considers herself/himself as having a mental illness, perceives need for professional help and plans to seek help in the near future. Methods. In a cross-sectional study, we examined 207 untreated persons with a depressive syndrome, all fulfilling criteria for a current mental illness as confirmed with a structured diagnostic interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview). The sample was recruited in the community using adverts, flyers and social media. We elicited causal explanations for the present problem, depression literacy, self-identification as having a mental illness, perceived need for professional help, help-seeking intentions, severity of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire - Depression), and whether respondents had previously sought mental healthcare. Results. Most participants fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder (n = 181, 87.4\%) and/or neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (n = 120, 58.0\%) according to the ICD-10. N = 94 (45.4\%) participants had never received mental health treatment previously. Exploratory factor analysis of a list of 25 different causal explanations resulted in five factors: biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma, current stress and unhealthy behaviour. Attributing the present problem to biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma and stress were all associated with stronger self-identification as having a mental illness. In persons who had never received mental health treatment previously, attribution to biomedical causes was related to greater perceived need and stronger help-seeking intentions. In those with treatment experience, lower attribution to person-related causes and stress were related to greater perceived need for professional help. Conclusions. While several causal explanations are associated with self-identification as having a mental illness, only biomedical attributions seem to be related to increase perceived need and help-seeking intentions, especially in individuals with no treatment experiences. Longitudinal studies investigating causal beliefs and help-seeking are needed to find out how causal attributions guide help-seeking behaviour. From this study it seems possible that portraying professional mental health treatment as not being restricted to biomedical problems would contribute to closing the treatment gap for mental disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1017/S2045796017000828,Causal beliefs; mental health; attitudes; help-seeking; other psychological issues;Mentally Ill Persons,,

Causes of MNSD were broadly either biological or supernatural. Treatment options were dependent on perceived cause of illness. Most traditional health practitioners were willing to collaborate with primary health care providers mainly through referring cases. Primary health care providers were unwilling to collaborate with traditional health practitioners because they perceived them to contribute to worsening of patients' prognoses. Conclusions Local terms and management modalities are available for some priority MNSD in this setting. Community level case detection and referral may be hindered by lack of collaboration between traditional health practitioners and primary health care providers. There is need for training on the recognition and management of all priority MNSD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0220034,Substance-Related Disorders;Kenya,,

A thematic analytic framework was used to identify and analyse themes that emerged within the data.Results: Consumers believed that causes were important and should be addressed in treatment, and identified several associated benefits including increased insight/personal understanding of their illness, symptom management and relapse prevention and reduced self-blame. Negative consequences and considerations were also identified.Conclusion: Causes help consumers make sense of their illness, and consumers would like causes to be addressed in treatment. More research is needed on how mental health professionals can address causes effectively as consumers are currently dissatisfied with how causes were discussed in their treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1080/09638237.2017.1417550,Mental health; causal beliefs; consumers; mental illness; treatment experience; recovery journey; qualitative data,,

Research shows that culture and ethnicity were found to play a significant role in both causal attributions of disability and disability-related stigma. Disability-related stigma was found to influence physical and mental health. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the relationships linking culture, causal attributions of disability and disability-related stigma, have not been previously examined. Objective: The study examined whether causal attributions (natural, mystic, punitive and emotional) to a specific disability-visual impairments - mediate the relationship between culture and stigma towards individuals with visual impairments. Methods: A quota sample comprised of 305 university and college students was drawn. Data were collected via a self-reported questionnaire. Results: The main findings indicated that emotional and punitive causal attribution to visual impairments mediated the relationship between culture and visual impairments-stigma; Israeli Arab-Palestinians had a higher tendency to attribute higher levels of punitive and emotional causes to visual impairments compared to Israeli Jews. Higher levels of punitive and emotional attributed causes for visual impairments were correlated with higher levels of visual impairments-stigma. Israeli Arab-Palestinians have a higher tendency to attribute visual impairments to mystic causes compared to Israeli Jews. However, this type of perceived causation was unrelated to visual impairments-stigma. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce visual impairments-stigma should focus on misconceptions concerning causation. It is especially important to design culturally sensitive interventions for visual impairments stigma reduction among Israeli Arab-Palestinians, which will focus on de-psychologizing visual impairments.

Method: Undergraduate psychology students completed measures on causal attribution, stigma, social distance, implicit person theory (IPT), and familiarity. Results: The hypothesis was partially supported; people who felt personality traits were unchangeable (i.e. entity IPT) were more likely to stigmatize individuals with mental disorders and desired more social distance from them. Familiarity with people with a MI individually predicted less desire for social distance, yet the redundancy of the predictors made the effect of familiarity on stigma fall just short of statistical significance.

A total of 60 participants who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or meet criteria for early intervention services for psychosis were randomly allocated to one of two conditions (psychosocial vs. biogenetic). Attitudes were assessed before and after the intervention. Both interventions resulted in a decrease in internalized stigma. Only the psychosocial intervention decreased external stigma.

A review was therefore conducted to identify the methods and criteria used in the international literature to study this phenomenon, and to synthesize the main findings on the factors associated with stigmatization. Method. - We conducted a systematic review of the literature in December 2016, on 113 articles on the social stigmatization of schizophrenia. Results. - Most of the articles used quantitative methods. We observed a significant relationship between the desire to establish a social distance from people with schizophrenia and a number of factors, such as the degree of familiarity with schizophrenia, the label ``schizophrenic{''}, the neurobiological causalities attributed to schizophrenia, or the stereotype of dangerousness. Articles using qualitative methods are rare, and this points to the importance of taking the socio-cultural context and ``lay{''} theories about schizophrenia into account in order to understand the phenomenon of stigmatization. Discussion. - These results suggest theoretical and methodological lines of approach to gain better understanding and tackle the problem of the social stigmatization of schizophrenia. They also stress the need for qualitative research in the French context. Conclusion. - This review could provide practical guidance for French researchers and practitioners working on the de stigmatization of schizophrenia and on socially stigmatized mental disorders more generally.

It is therefore crucial to understand how stigma develops in order to counteract it by setting up effective evidence-based anti-stigma interventions. The present study examines the effect of causal beliefs on stigmatizing behavioral intentions, namely people's desire to distance themselves from persons with mental illness. In addition, we draw cross-cultural comparisons between native Germans and Turkish immigrants to investigate the influence of culture on stigma and causal beliefs and to broaden knowledge on the biggest immigrant group in Germany and on immigrants in Western countries in general. Methods: n = 302 native Germans and n = 173 Turkish immigrants were presented either a depression or a schizophrenia vignette. Then, causal beliefs, emotional reaction and desire for social distance were assessed with questionnaires. Path analyses were carried out to investigate the influence of causal beliefs on the desire for social distance and their mediation by emotional reactions for Germans and Turkish immigrants, respectively. Results: We found an influence of causal beliefs on the desire for social distance. Emotional reactions partly mediated this relationship. Causal attribution patterns as well as the relationship between causal attributions and stigma varied across both subsamples and mental illnesses. In the German subsample, the ascription of unfavorable personal traits resulted in more stigma. In the Turkish immigrant subsample, supernatural causal beliefs increased stigma while attribution to current stress reduced stigma. Conclusion: Our study has implications for future anti-stigma interventions that intend to reduce stigmatization of mentally ill people. Targeting the ascription of unfavorable personal traits and supernatural causal attributions as well as promoting current stress as the cause for mental illness appears to be of particular importance. Also, the mediating influence of emotional responses to causal beliefs needs to be addressed.

Bhutanese refugees resettled in the USA are disproportionately affected by suicide, yet little research has been conducted to identify factors contributing to this vulnerability. This study aims to investigate the issue of suicide of Bhutanese refugee communities via an in-depth qualitative, social-ecological approach. Methods. Focus groups were conducted with 83 Bhutanese refugees (adults and children), to explore the perceived causes, and risk and protective factors for suicide, at individual, family, community, and societal levels. Audio recordings were translated and transcribed, and inductive thematic analysis conducted. Results. Themes identified can be situated across all levels of the social-ecological model. Individual thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are only fully understood when considering past experiences, and stressors at other levels of an individual's social ecology. Shifting dynamics and conflict within the family are pervasive and challenging. Within the community, there is a high prevalence of suicide, yet major barriers to communicating with others about distress and suicidality. At the societal level, difficulties relating to acculturation, citizenship, employment and finances, language, and literacy are influential. Two themes cut across several levels of the ecosystem: loss; and isolation, exclusion, and loneliness. Conclusions. This study extends on existing research and highlights the necessity for future intervention models of suicide to move beyond an individual focus, and consider factors at all levels of refugees' social-ecology. Simply focusing treatment at the individual level is not sufficient. Researchers and practitioners should strive for community-driven, culturally relevant, socio-ecological approaches for prevention and treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1017/gmh.2018.34,Etiology; mental health; qualitative research; refugee populations; suicide;Suicide,,

Methods: This prospective study included consecutive stroke patients after medical rehabilitation. Three and 12 months post stroke they completed the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) and questionnaires on physical and mental health. All eight IP and their changes over time were described. Clusters of patients with comparable IP trajectories were constructed by k-means clustering, with subsequent comparison of patient characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between IP clusters and 12-month mental health. Results: Hundred-and-eighty-four patients were included (men n = 107 {[}58.2\%]; mean age 61.1 {[}SD 12.7] years). At 3 months, the scores of the IP coherence (mean 3.0, SD 2.3) and treatment control (mean 3.2, SD 2.5) were lowest (best), and consequences (mean 6.1, SD 2.8) and anticipated timeline (mean 6.0, SD 2.7) were highest (worst).

Within the diagnostic context, clinicians should take into account patients' culturally shaped presentation of symptoms. Therefore, we sought to provide insights into beliefs about causes of PTSD held by Sub-Saharan African asylum seekers living in Germany. To this aim, we used a quantitative and qualitative methodological triangulation strategy based on a vignette describing symptoms of PTSD. In the first part of the study, asylum seekers (n = 119), predominantly from Eritrea (n = 41), Somalia (n = 36), and Cameroon (n = 25), and a German comparison sample without a migration background (n = 120) completed the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R). In the second part, asylum seekers reviewed the results within eight focus group discussions (n = 26), sampled from groups of the three main countries of origin. Descriptive analyses of the first part demonstrated that asylum seekers predominantly attributed PTSD symptoms to psychological and religious causes, and rather disagreed with supernatural causes. In comparison to the German sample without a migration background, asylum seekers attributed symptoms less strongly to terrible experiences, but more strongly to religious and supernatural causes. Within the focus group discussions, six attribution categories of participants' causal beliefs were identified: (a) traumatic life experiences, (b) psychological causes, (c) social causes, (d) post-migration stressors, (e) religious causes, and (f) supernatural causes. Our findings suggest that the current Western understanding of PTSD is as relevant to migrants as to non-migrants in terms of psychological causation, but might differ regarding the religious and supernatural realm. While awareness of culture-specific belief systems of asylum seekers from Sub-Saharan Africa regarding PTSD is important, our findings do underline, at the same time, that cultural differences should not be overstated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00628,"asylum seekers; causal beliefs; post-traumatic stress disorder; refugees; Sub-Saharan Africa; trauma;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Germany",,

The aim of the mixed-methods study was to test whether patients in routine care for depression differ from patients with depression in routine care for cardiac diseases regarding illness beliefs about depression.MethodsA consecutive sample of n=217 patients with depressive disorder was recruited from routine care for depression (N=148) and routine care for cardiac diseases (N=69). Beliefs about depression were measured by the Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire. Causal beliefs were categorized using qualitative methods. To investigate differences regarding other illness beliefs, we performed an ANCOVA controlling for sociodemographic and clinical differences by propensity score matching.ResultsPatients in routine care for cardiac diseases attributed their depression more often to physical illnesses (48\% vs. 16\%) and less often to their self (30\% vs. 47\%), problems at work (25\% vs. 35\%), childhood (25\% vs. 30\%), and negative life events (19\% vs. 25\%) in contrast to patients in routine care for depression.

To date, these attacks are not considered as a manifestation of a particular mental illness. However, the process of radicalization of suicide-attackers has to interest the field of mental health. One plausible explanation for the radicalization of individuals is the use of biased cognitive schemes by the indoctrinator. Among these cognitive schemes could figure the causal attribution bias in which the subject cannot distinguish in front of two factors that operate simultaneously, the share of each factor in achieving a certain goal. Another cognitive bias would be the confirmation bias during which the subject would tend to adhere to ideas from his/her own thinking or the thinking of subjects who share some cultural values with him/her and refute any other ideas. Finally, the bias of polarization or splitting could also be incriminated. Through this bias, the subject would either be proud of being a member of a cultural group or ashamed when he/she feels that this group is being attacked and that he/she is unable to rescue it. Approaches to increase the awareness of individuals to the adverse effects of these biased cognitive schemes may theoretically reduce the risk of committing suicide-attacks. However, despite numerous attempts of ``deradicalization{''} involving technological means of communication as well as social ``reintegration{''} centers, all approaches aiming at raising awareness of cognitive biases need to be studied in a scientific manner before they become widespread.

While some are cases of temporary transitions or short-term inactivity, others represent a more vulnerable group at risk of early work disability. Early exclusion from the labor market represents long lives exposed to detrimental effects of unemployment on health and well-being, and constitutes an economic burden for society. There is need for more knowledge about young adults who are at risk of early work disability but have not yet reached the point of more permanent exclusion. This study aims to investigate social and health-related problems in a Norwegian sample of young adults at risk of early work disability, and their self-perceived causes of illness.MethodsBaseline data from participants in the SEED-trial (N=96), a randomized controlled trial comparing individual placement and support to traditional vocational rehabilitation in young adults at risk of early work disability, were analyzed. Background, health behaviors, adverse social experiences, disability level, physical and mental health, social support, coping, and self-perceived causal attributions of illness were measured. Gender differences were analyzed using chi-square and t-tests.ResultsMean age was 24, and 68\% were men. One third reported reading and writing difficulties, and 40\% had less than high-school education. The majority had experienced bullying (66\%) or violence (39\%), and 53\% reported hazardous alcohol use. Psychological distress was the most prevalent health problem (52\%), and women generally had more physical and mental health problems than men. Self-perceived causal attributions of illness were mainly related to relational problems, followed by health behaviors, heredity/genetics, and external environmental factors.ConclusionsThe study provides a deeper insight into a vulnerable group with substantial challenges related to adverse social experiences, psychological distress, and alcohol use, who emphasized relational problems as the main causal factor for their illness. Findings suggest a need for broader focus on psychological and social factors in vocational rehabilitation efforts targeting young adults at risk of early work disability.

As far as the cause of schizophrenia by the general public concerned, people living in western countries focus mainly on biological and social risk factors such as genetic vulnerability, disease of the brain, infection or stressful social conditions or personal weakness, but the predominant views held by people living in non-western countries focus mainly on supernatural and religious factors. Awareness and beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses influence the preferred treatments. The aim of this study was to determine the perceptions regarding the etiology of schizophrenia and the associated factors by theology students.MethodsAn institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Holy Trinity Theological College students from May to June 2016. Self-administered Short Explanatory Model Interview was used to assess the perception of what causes the syndrome of schizophrenia. Data entry was performed by Epi-info version 3.5.3 and the Statistical Program for Social Science (SPSS version 20) was used for data clearance, and analyses.ResultsA total of 409 students were involved in the survey. The mean age of the participants was 33.3years (standard deviation8.3) and almost all 94.4\% of them were males. The majority (81.7\%) of the participant recognized schizophrenia as a mental illness. Only 16.9\% of the participants attributed supernatural phenomenon as a cause of schizophrenia and most of them 76.5\% (313) thought of psychosocial problems as the cause of schizophrenia. About 40.1\% of the participant endorsed biological factors as a cause of schizophrenia. About two-thirds (68.2\%) of the participant thought schizophrenia as severe but not fatal illness and about 22.2\% of them thought both severe and fatal illness. As far as the course concerned majority (88.5\%) of the participants thought schizophrenia as a chronic illness and about 11.5\% thought acute illness. Regarding the treatment, almost all (99.8\%) of reported schizophrenia is treatable. Moreover, concerning the consequences of the illness about 18.8\% reported the death as a consequence and about 66.7, 34.7 and 7.8\% reported madness, family disintegration and losing a job, respectively. Urban residency and holding other degree were significantly associated with biological factors as a cause of schizophrenia (p<0.05). Whereas getting information from mass media and health professional, marital status (married) and urban residence were significantly associated with psychosocial factors as the cause of schizophrenia. Furthermore, rural residency was significantly associated with the supernatural phenomenon as the cause of schizophrenia.ConclusionIn the current study, the majority of the participant recognized schizophrenia as a mental illness and a treatable syndrome. A vast majority of the participantthought of psychosocial problems as the cause of schizophrenia about two-thirds of the participant thought schizophrenia as a severe but not fatal illness.

Individuals generated their models via external (family, professionals) and internal (evaluative, positive affect) processes and reported differing levels of conviction in relation to their beliefs. Clinicians should take the opportunity to explore the causal beliefs of their service-users, as they are able to provide intelligent and thoughtful explanatory models. In particular, clinicians should be aware of the emotional impact of different aetiological models and their personal role in the development of a client's beliefs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10597-017-0219-3,Explanatory models; Health beliefs; Schizophrenia; Mental health;Psychotic Disorders;Causality,,

The factor structure to the causal beliefs scale is explored. The causal beliefs relating to five different mental illnesses (alcohol abuse, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), dementia and schizophrenia) and desire for social distance are also investigated. Methods.Data from 3006 participants from a nationwide vignette-based study on mental health literacy were analysed using factor analysis and multiple logistic regression to address the aims. Participants answered questions related to sociodemographic information, causal beliefs of mental illness and their desire for social distance towards those with mental illness. Results.Physical causes, psychosocial causes and personality causes were endorsed by the sample. Sociodemographic differences including ethnic, gender and age differences in causal beliefs were found in the sample. Differences in causal beliefs were shown across different mental illness vignettes though psychosocial causes was the most highly attributed cause across vignettes (endorsed by 97.9\% of respondents), followed by personality causes (83.5\%) and last, physical causes (37\%). Physical causes were more likely to be endorsed for OCD, depression and schizophrenia. Psychosocial causes were less often endorsed for OCD. Personality causes were less endorsed for dementia but more associated with depression. Conclusions.The factor structure of the causal beliefs scale is not entirely the same as that found in previous research. Further research on the causal beliefs endorsed by Southeast Asian communities should be conducted to investigate other potential causes such as biogenetic factors and spiritual/supernatural causes. Mental health awareness campaigns should address causes of mental illness as a topic. Lay beliefs in the different causes must be acknowledged and it would be beneficial for the public to be informed of the causes of some of the most common mental illnesses in order to encourage help-seeking and treatment compliance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1017/S2045796017000105,Mental health; mental illness stigma; multicultural; population survey; social distance;Mentally Ill Persons,,

They are indigenous people living in remote valleys of the Hindu Kush Mountains in northern Pakistan, neighboring Afghanistan. The Kalasha are pastoral, as well as agricultural people to some extent, although they are increasingly facing pressures from globalization and social change, which may be influencing youth and community development. Their traditional world view dichotomizes and emphasizes on the division of the pure (Onjeshta) and the impure (Pragata). There remains a scarcity of literature on mental health and resilience of indigenous communities in South Asia and Pakistan generally, and the polytheistic Kalasha community specifically. Thus, the current study was conducted with the aim to explore the cultural protective factors (resilience) of the Kalasha youth (adolescents and emerging adults) and to explore their perceived etiological understandings and preferred interventions for mental health support systems. The theoretical framework of Bronfenbrenner's (1, 2) ecological systems model was used. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was conducted, considering the advantage of its idiographic approach and the ``double hermeneutic{''} analytic process. This methodology was consistent with the aim to understand and make sense of mental health and resilience from the Kalasha indigenous perspective. A total of 12 in-depth interviews were conducted with adolescents and emerging adults (5 males, 7 females), along with ethnographic observations. The analysis revealed 3 superordinate themes of mental health perceptions and interventions, each with more specific emergent themes: (1) Psychological Resilience/Cultural Protective Factors Buffering Against Mental Health Problems (Intra-Communal Bonding \& Sharing; Kalasha Festivals \& Traditions; Purity Concept; Behavioral Practice of Happiness and Cognitive Patterns); (2) Perceived Causes of Mental Health Issues (Biological \& Psychosocial; Supernatural \& Spiritual; Environmental); and (3) Preferred Interventions {[}Shamanic Treatment; Ta'awiz (Amulets); Communal Sharing \& Problem Solving; Medical Treatment; Herbal Methods]. The overall findings point to the need for developing culturally-sensitive and indigenous measures and therapeutic interventions. The findings highlighted the Kalasha cultural practices which may promote resilience. The findings also call for indigenous sources of knowledge to be considered when collaboratively designing public health programs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fpubh.2018.00187,indigenous; resilience; ethnic minority; mountain people; marginalized; mental health; South Asia; Pakistan;Adolescent;Poverty;Mental Health,,

We do not know how children intuitively conceptualize obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), nor do we know the relative impact of biomedical or cognitive behavioural conceptual explanations, yet both are being widely used in psychoeducation for children with OCD. Aims: This study identified children's naive concepts of OCD, and the comparative impact of biomedical versus cognitive behavioural psychoeducation on perceived prognosis. Method: A within- and between-subjects experimental design was used. After watching a video of a young person describing their OCD, 202 children completed a questionnaire examining their concepts of the condition. They repeated the questionnaire following a second equivalent video, this time preceded by either biomedical or cognitive behavioural psychoeducation. Results: Participants' naive concepts of OCD reflected predominant models of OCD in healthcare. Even at the minimal dose of psychoeducation, participants' conceptualizations of OCD changed. Prior exposure to OCD resulted in a stronger alignment with the biomedical model. Exposure to biomedical psychoeducation resulted in participants predicting a slower recovery with less chance of complete remission. Conclusion: Psychoeducation for childhood OCD is impactful. Despite its wide use by clinicians and mental health services, biomedical psychoeducation appears to have deleterious effects. Children's concepts of OCD merit attention but caution should be applied in how they are targeted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1017/S1352465818000115,children and adolescents; obsessive-compulsive disorder; causal attributions; CBT;Only Child;Child;Cognition,,

Patient perceptions of biomedical models of OCD have been understudied, particularly in how they relate to patients' beliefs about prognosis and treatment expectancy. The current study measured self-identified OCD patients' (N = 130) current beliefs about their own prognosis and treatment and how believable they found two explanatory models of OCD: 1) a biomedical model that attributes OCD to biological functioning in the brain and 2) an integrative biopsychopsychocial model. Correlational results indicated that patients who found the biomedical model to be highly believable expected that their OCD would be chronic and require long-term treatment. In contrast, ratings of believability in the model that integrated biological, psychological and social factors in explaining OCD were not associated with prognostic pessimism. Instead, we observed a trend in which stronger belief in the biopsychosocial model was associated with the belief that behavioral changes could improve symptoms of OCD.

However, not much is known about the work of traditional healers largely because their methods are shrouded in mysticism and secrecy. There is a need to understand the ideology and beliefs of traditional healers surrounding mental disorders, including knowledge about their practices in mental health care. Aims: In this article, we discuss the causal beliefs and treatment methods of traditional medicine-men from Accra, Ghana. We also describe their diagnostic and treatment methods for mental disorders. Methods: Eight medicine-men, indigenous to the Greater Accra Region, were interviewed through individual semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed through thematic analysis. Results: The medicine-men's beliefs about mental illness were dominated by supernatural ideas. Mental illness was also seen as a form of punishment or resulting from envy, and there was a strong reliance on spiritual direction from the gods for diagnosis and treatment.

A systematic review examining whether endorsing biogenetic causes decreases mental illness stigma in people with mental illness and mental health professionals was undertaken using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Multiple databases were searched, and studies that explored the relationship between biogenetic causal beliefs and mental illness stigma in people with mental illness or mental health professionals were considered. Studies were included if they focussed on depression, schizophrenia, or mental illness in general, were in English, and had adult participants. The search identified 11 journal articles reporting on 15 studies, which were included in this review. Of these, only two provided evidence that endorsing biogenetic causes was associated with less mental illness stigma in people with mental illness or mental health professionals. The majority of studies in the present review (n = 10) found that biogenetic causal beliefs were associated with increased stigma or negative attitudes towards mental illness. The present review highlights the lack of research exploring the impacts of endorsing biogenetic causes in people with mental illness and mental health professionals.

The beliefs held by young patients regarding the causes of mental illness impact their treatment-seeking behaviour. It is pertinent to know the commonly held attributions around mental illness so as to effectively provide psychological care, especially in a resource constrained context such as Kenya. This helps in targeting services around issues such as stigma and extending youth-friendly services. Methods: Guided by the private theories interview (PTI-P) and attributional framework, individual semi-structured interviews were carried out with ten young adults of ages 18-25 years about their mental health condition for which they were undergoing treatment. Each interview took 30-45 min. We mapped four attributions (locus of control, stability, controllability and stigma) on PTI-P questions. Data was transcribed verbatim to produce transcripts coded using interpretive phenomenological analysis. These codes were then broken down into categories that could be used to understand various attributions. Results: We found PTI-P to be a useful tool and it elicited three key themes: (a) psychosocial triggers of distress (with themes of negative thoughts, emotions around mental health stigma and negative childhood experiences, parents' separation or divorce, death of a loved one etc.), (b) biological conditions and psychopathologies limiting intervention, and (c) preferences and views on treatment. Mapping these themes on our attributional framework, PTI-P themes presented as causal attributions explaining stigma, locus of control dimensions and stability. External factors were mainly ascribed to be the cause of unstable and uncontrollable attributions including persistent negative emotions and thoughts further exacerbating psychological distress. Nine out of the ten participants expressed the need for more intense and supportive therapy. Conclusion: Our study has provided some experiential evidence in understanding how stigma, internal vs external locus of control, stability vs instability attributions play a role in shaping attitudes young people have towards their mental health. Our study points to psychosocial challenges such as stigma, poverty and lack of social support that continue to undermine mental well-being of Kenyan youth. These factors need to be considered when addressing mental health needs of young people in Kenya.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s13034-018-0229-0,Youth in psychiatric facilities; Attributions of mental illness; Locus of control; Private theories interview; Stigma,,

Research has underscored that psychological factors, such as anxiety and depression, are associated with its development and maintenance and related sexual impairment. However, the daily role of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the pain and sexuality outcomes of couples coping with vulvodynia is not well understood. Using a dyadic daily experience method, 127 women (mean age = 26.21, SD = 6.24 years) diagnosed with vulvodynia and their partners (mean age = 27.44, SD = 7.29 years) reported on anxiety and depressive symptoms, pain, sexual function, and sexual distress over a period of 8 weeks. Multilevel modeling was used to examine how daily deviations in anxiety and depressive symptoms from a participant's own mean were associated with pain, sexual function, and sexual distress. On days of sexual activity, when women reported higher anxiety and depressive symptoms (compared with their average), they reported greater pain and lower sexual function. On days of sexual activity, when women reported higher depressive symptoms, they reported greater levels of sexual distress, and when partners reported higher anxiety and depressive symptoms, women as well as partners reported greater levels of sexual distress. Results suggest that daily anxiety and depressive symptoms play a role in women's experience of vulvodynia-related pain, women's sexual function, and the couple's sexual distress. Targeting daily anxiety and depressive symptoms could enhance the efficacy of psychological interventions for vulvodynia. Perspective: This article examines the daily associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms, women's pain, sexual function, and sexual distress among couples coping with vulvodynia. Findings contribute to refine the biopsychosocial model of pain, showing that daily affective factors are associated with pain and sexual well-being.

Yet little is known about how causal attributions about depression vary among low-income racial minorities. This study examined beliefs about causes of depression and their demographic, clinical and treatment correlates in a lower income African American sample. MethodVolunteers (N=110) aged 24-79 years, who participated in a family study of depression, completed a 45-item questionnaire on their beliefs about the causes of depression. We used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to cluster items into causal domains and multivariate regression analyses to test associations of causal domains with demographic and clinical characteristics and treatments received. ResultsThree causal domains, conceptualized as Eastern culture/supernatural (ECS), Western culture/natural/psychosocial (WCN-P), and /neurobiological (WCN-N) attributions, were derived from MDS clusters. WCN-P was most commonly endorsed (50\%-91\%) and ECS least endorsed as causes of depression (10-44\%). This pattern held across gender, age, educational levels, and diagnostic category. WCN-N items were moderately endorsed, with some distinction between genetic causes and other biological causes. WCN-N was positively associated with medication as opposed to other forms of treatment (B=1.17; p=.049). ConclusionAmong low-income African Americans, beliefs about causes of depression are varied but broadly consistent explanatory models that include a combination of psychosocial causes with genetic/biological contributions. For certain individuals, supernatural and natural causal attributions may coexist without dissonance. Causal attributions may be associated with types of treatment accepted and have implications for treatment compliance and adherence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1002/jclp.22523,Blacks; causal attributions; cluster analysis; depression; illness perceptions;African Americans,,

We explored how participants describe depression, to what cause they attribute depression, and what sources of treatment they would recommend. Methods: Participants first were assessed with the Center for Epidemiological-Depression scale (CES-D), with a cut-point of 16 or greater indicative of depression. The Short Explanatory Model Interview (SEMI), a semistructured questionnaire, was our primary tool for exploring participants' explanatory models relating to a vignette describing a rural Chinese woman with depression. Results: Among the 416 women who consented and completed the SEMI, 277(66.6\%) reported that the woman in the vignette had something wrong with her health. Among these, only 8(2.9\%) women provided a specific psychiatric name for the condition, while 150(54.2\%) provided non-specific psychiatric disease names or affective symptoms, and 78(28.2\%) of the sample provided physical disease names. Participants attributed causes largely to internal factors (41.5\%) or external factors (36.8\%). In terms of help-seeking, 101(36.4\%) said the woman in the vignette should see a doctor, 70(25.3\%) indicated that she should solve the problem herself, and 42(15.2\%) recommended seeking support from family members and friends. We did not find any differences in recognition, causal attribution, and help-seeking suggestions between women with a CES-D = 16 and those with CES-D < 16. Limitations: The use of a vignette to prompt discussion was not the same as talking about real-life personal situations. Conclusion: Our results point to potential challenges and opportunities that lay ahead as China develops mental health services in its vast rural areas among women who may be at risk for developing depression. We found that our participants often attributed their symptoms to internal or external social causes, and preferred not speaking with family members and friends. Our findings suggest that rural Chinese women may be reticent to recognize or describe categorical concepts such as ``depression{''} as a health problem, and they invite further consideration about how best to develop new health services in China's rural regions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.jad.2017.10.016,Women; Rural China; Depression; Help-seeking; Short Explanatory Model Interview; SEMI;Depression;China,,

Aim: The aim of this study was to deepen the knowledge of how attitudes toward people with mental illness are affected by specific personal beliefs and characteristics, such as culture and religion of the perceiver. More precisely, the main purpose is the definition of a structure of variables, namely perceived dangerousness, social closeness, and avoidance of the ill person, together with the beliefs about the best treatment to be undertaken and the sick person' gender, capable of describing the complexity of the stigma construct in particular as far as schizophrenia is concerned. Method: The study involved 305 university students, 183 from the University of Padua, Italy, and 122 from the University of Haifa, Israel. For the analyses, a latent class analysis (LCA) approach was chosen to identify a latent categorical structure accounting for the covariance between the observed variables. Such a latent structure was expected to be moderated by cultural background (Italy versus Israel) and religious beliefs, whereas causal beliefs, recommended treatment, dangerousness, social closeness, and public avoidance were the manifest variables, namely the observed indicators of the latent variable. Results: Two sets of results were obtained. First, the relevance of the manifest variables as indicators of the hypothesized latent variable was highlighted. Second, a two-latentclass categorical dimension represented by prejudicial attitudes, causal beliefs, and treatments concerning schizophrenia was found. Specifically, the differential effects of the two cultures and the religious beliefs on the latent structure and their relations highlighted the relevance of the observed variables as indicators of the expected latent variable. Conclusion: The present study contributes to the improvement of the understanding of how attitudes toward people with mental illness are affected by specific personal beliefs and characteristics of the perceiver. The definition of a structure of variables capable of describing the complexity of the stigma construct in particular as far as schizophrenia is concerned was achieved from a cross-cultural perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02289,cross-cultures; schizophrenia; causal beliefs; dangerousness; closeness; avoidance; treatment; latent class analysis;Schizophrenia,,

Deficiencies in emotion regulation are evident in many psychiatric disorders, including depression. Patients with depression show, for instance, disrupted neural emotion regulation in cognitive regulation regions such as lateral and medial prefrontal cortices. Since depressed individuals tend to attribute positive events to external circumstances and negative events to themselves, modifying this non-self-serving attributional style may represent a promising regulation strategy. Spontaneous causal attributions are generally processed in medial brain structures, particularly the precuneus. However, so far no study has investigated neural correlates of instructed causal attributions (e.g. instructing a person to intentionally relate positive events to the self) and their potential to regulate emotions. The current study therefore aimed to examine how instructed causal attributions of positive and negative events affect the emotional experience of depressed individuals as well as its neural bases. For this purpose pictures of sad and happy faces were presented to 26 patients with a lifetime major depression (MDD) and 26 healthy controls (HC) during fMRI. Participants should respond naturally ({''}view{''}) or imagine that the person on the picture was sad/happy because of them ({''}internal attribution{''}) or because something else happened ({''}external attribution{''}). Trait attributional style and depressive symptoms were assessed with questionnaires to examine potential influential factors on emotion regulation ability. Results revealed that patients compared to controls show a non-self-serving trait attributional style (i.e. more external attributions of positive events and more internal attributions of negative events). Intriguingly, when instructed to apply specific causal attributions during the emotion regulation task, patients and controls were similarly able to regulate positive and negative emotions. Regulating emotions through instructed attributions (internal/external attribution > view) generally engaged the precuneus, which was correlated with patients' trait attributional style (i.e. more precuneus activation during external > view was linked to a general tendency to relate positive events to external sources). Up-regulating happiness through internal (compared to external) attributions recruited the parahippocampal gyrus only in controls. The down-regulation of sadness (external > internal attribution), in contrast, engaged the superior frontal gyrus only in patients. Superior frontal gyrus activation thereby correlated with depression severity, which implies a greater need of cognitive resources for a successful regulation in more severely depressed. Patients and controls did not differ in activation in brain regions related to cognitive emotion regulation or attribution. However, results point to a disturbed processing of positive emotions in depression. Interestingly, increased precuneus resting-state connectivity with emotion regulation brain regions (inferior parietal lobule, middle frontal gyrus) was linked to healthier attributions (i.e. external attributions of negative events) in patients and controls. Adequate neural communication between these regions therefore seem to facilitate an adaptive trait attributional style. Findings of this study emphasize that despite patients' dysfunctional trait attributional style, explicitly applying causal attributions effectively regulates emotions. Future research should examine the efficacy of instructed attributions in reducing negative affect and anhedonia in depressed patients, for instance by means of attribution trainings during psychotherapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not sure",10.1016/j.nicl.2018.10.025,Emotion regulation; Depression; Attribution; Positive emotions; Precuneus; fMRI; Resting-state connectivity;Magnetic Resonance Imaging,,

Attributions are causal explanations people make for specific behaviors, characteristics, occurrences, or differences. Research has found that genetic attributions are related to numerous biopsychosocial phenomena (e.g., perceptions about one's own health, attitudes toward others) that impact individuals and societies. Unfortunately, often these causal attributions are linked to problematic outcomes. For example, genetic attributions for the etiology of illness are often associated with decreased personal control and well-being. Additionally, genetic attributions for group differences are related to psychological essentialism (i.e., the belief that members of a group all share a deep, underlying ``essence{''}), which, in turn, tends to be associated with stereotyping and prejudice. With the following brief overview of theoretical and empirical work related to genetic attributions, I discuss how instructors can incorporate discussions of this important concept into their psychology courses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0098628317745463,Genetic attributions; attribution theory; causal explanations; psychological essentialism; implicit theories;Self Psychology,,

Prominent response themes were identified through a content analysis. Findings The most common theme was the exposure to an obesogenic environment, such as the more pervasive diffusion of unhealthy food options. Hispanic participants were more likely to report the acquisition of unhealthy food practices and struggled more to maintain their traditional food habits. Time constraints, mostly due to working long hours, were the second most common theme, as participants had little time for making healthier lifestyle choices. The cold weather was considered as a contributor to obesity-leading behaviors and mood disorders. Hispanic respondents were more likely to describe settlement-induced psychological stressors and often compensated feelings of depression and isolation by eating emotionally and increasing the consumption of comfort foods. Weight increases were more likely within the first five years of arrival. Practical implications Preventive efforts should include social integration strategies to counter depression, and provide recommendations on feeding times and sleeping habits.

J.",,English,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","Background: Posttraumatic stress (PTS) results in significant distress or functional impairment. Prevalence studies report higher rates of PTS in forcibly displaced children (FDC). Current evidence deriving mainly from cross-sectional studies is unable to make causal attributions. Given rising rates of forcible displacement reported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2014, there is increasing need to determine the best policies and practice for engaging mental health needs of FDC. Methods: This systematic review identifies (1) longitudinal risk and protective factors and correlates for PTS and (2) its natural history in FDC, contributing to research identifying vulnerable subgroups and malleable factors for PTS and understanding its natural history. No meta-analysis was conducted due to heterogeneity; results were analyzed through narrative synthesis. Results: Eleven longitudinal studies were identified. All but one were prospective cohort designs. They identified prevalence rates between 20\% and 48.7\% at baseline, 10\% and 48.3\% at 1 year (k = 7), 18\% and 48\% at 2-3 years (k = 2), 8\% and 38\% at 6 years (k = 2), and 35\% at 12 years using nine measurement methods in seven independent samples. Evidence from multiple associations supported the following risk factors: exposure to traumatic stressors or other stress, older age, and prior psychopathology. Evidence predominantly supported the stability of PTS with some decline. Conclusion: While results should be interpreted with caution given small or unrepresentative samples, they suggest regular mental health screenings should be conducted for FDC, who are a vulnerable subgroup with variable onset and remission. Risk associations with prior psychopathology also suggest that screening upon arrival may be advisable for early intervention and prevention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1177/1524838015622437,posttraumatic stress; forcibly displaced children; mental health; traumatic experiences; longitudinal study; cohort study; natural history; PTSD,,

We compared CIT-trained officers who had volunteered with those who had been assigned using data from two prior, linked studies that compared CIT-trained and non-CIT officers on knowledge, attitudes, and skills (251 CIT-trained officers; 68\% had volunteered), as well as behaviors (517 actual encounters provided by 91 CIT-trained officers; 70\% had volunteered).

The Taiwanese respondents rated psychiatrists and clinical psychologists as more helpful than social workers and general practitioners (GPs) and expressed more uncertainty about the usefulness of certain medications when compared to the Australian and Japanese samples. Interestingly, Taiwanese Chinese hold similarly high levels of stigma towards schizophrenia, but lower levels of stigma towards depression when compared to the Japanese respondents. Taiwanese respondents who have higher levels of mental health literacy about schizophrenia were less willing to interact with people with schizophrenia than those with lower levels of mental health literacy. Conclusion: This study underlines the need for public education programmes to improve knowledge of various mental illnesses and to reduce stigmatising attitudes among Taiwanese Chinese. The aforementioned socially and culturally driven beliefs must be taken into consideration so that culturally relevant education programmes can be developed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0020764017719303,Depression literacy; schizophrenia literacy; stigmatising attitudes; perceptions of causation of mental illness; Taiwanese Chinese;Taiwan;Mental Health,,

This study sought to associate participants' beliefs about IPV held during childhood with their adjustment as adults, and to compare their beliefs from childhood to their beliefs in early adulthood. MethodA nationally representative sample of 703 Swedish young adults reported on their past and present beliefs about the causes of their parents' IPV. Standardized measures assessed their mental health (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress symptoms) and the quality of their relationships as adults. ResultsThe most common explanations for IPV were that the perpetrator suffered from physical or mental illness, had relationship problems, or was distressed. Participants were less likely to blame themselves for IPV or to believe that the perpetrator was cruel when they were adults, compared to their reports of themselves as children. Women were more likely to attribute mental or physical illness as the cause of the perpetrator's IPV. Childhood beliefs that the perpetrator was debilitated (from mental illness or substance abuse) and cruel (took pleasure in violence and/or despised the child) were associated with greater mental health problems and poorer relationship quality in adulthood. ConclusionEvaluation of children's harmful beliefs about IPV could be useful in adapting intervention services aimed at ameliorating negative personal causal attributions.

It is unclear whether evidence-based treatment strategies are guided by pro-social or stigmatizing attitudes and emotions. In a representative population survey in Germany (n = 3642), we asked respondents to what extent they would recommend psychotropic medication, psychotherapy and relaxation techniques for a person with mental illness described in an unlabelled vignette. For each treatment recommendation, we used multinomial logistic regression analyses to obtain predicted probabilities. Predictors comprised illness recognition, vignette condition, causal beliefs (current stress, childhood adversities, biogenetic), emotions (fear, anger, pro-social reactions), social distance, age, gender and education. Fear predicted greater probability for recommending psychotropic drugs in all investigated illnesses (p < 0.001), whereas associations of fear with recommending psychotherapy were generally lower and no associations with the recommendation for relaxation techniques were found. Anger was related to fewer recommendations for psychotherapy in all illnesses (p < 0.01). Pro-social reactions were predominantly related to the recommendation of relaxation techniques for a person with schizophrenia or major depression (p < 0.001). Higher desire for social distance predicted fewer recommendations for relaxation techniques in all three vignette conditions (p < 0.05).

It is probable that, like other health professionals, GPs are not all free of prejudices toward PWS. In clinical practice, GPs sometimes interact with clients diagnosed with schizophrenia by specialists, passively accepting this diagnosis. Other times, GPs interact with clients having symptoms of schizophrenia but who have not been diagnosed. In this case, GPs are expected to actively make a diagnosis. Giving the key role of GPs in the process of care, it is worthwhile examining whether passive acceptance and active usage of the diagnosis schizophrenia have differential effects on GPs' attitudes toward people with this disorder. Aims: To investigate GPs' views of schizophrenia and whether they were influenced by a schizophrenia' label, passively accepted or actively used. Methods: A total of 430 randomly selected GPs were invited to complete a questionnaire about their views of schizophrenia, either after reading a description of this disorder and making a diagnosis, or without being provided with a description but passively accepting the label schizophrenia' given in the questionnaire. Results: The GPs who passively accepted the label schizophrenia (n=195) and those who actively identified schizophrenia from the description (n=127) had similar views. Compared to the GPs who did not identify schizophrenia in the description (n=65), those who used the diagnosis, actively or passively: more frequently reported heredity and less frequently psychosocial factors as causes of the disorder; were more skeptical about recovery; were more convinced of the need for long-term pharmacotherapies; believed more strongly that PWS should be discriminated against when in medical hospital; and perceived PWS as more dangerous and as kept at greater social distance. Conclusion: The diagnosis schizophrenia', however used, is associated with pessimistic views.

The aim of this systematic review was to examine the impact of causal beliefs on treatment outcome and stigma in people experiencing psychosis. Three main databases were searched and 21 articles that investigated various aspects of treatment outcome, and stigma in relation to causal beliefs was included in the review. Overall, there were a small number of replicated findings which limits the interpretation of results. There is an indication that causal explanations are associated with various treatment outcomes, including attitudes towards treatment and satisfaction with therapeutic relationships as well as internalized stigma. Spiritual beliefs appeared to be adopted as a coping mechanism and a way to reduce stigma but did not appear to be associated with treatment outcome. Individuals with psychosis do appear to develop causal beliefs that may be associated with engagement with services and treatment, as well as impacting on their attitudes towards themselves and others with mental illness.

However, there are few studies exploring patients' causal beliefs about their mental disorder. Objectives (a) To qualitatively explore patients' causal beliefs of their mental disorder, (b) to explore frequencies of patients stating causal beliefs, and (c) to investigate differences of causal beliefs according to patients' primary diagnoses. Method Inpatients in psychosomatic rehabilitation were asked an open-ended question about their three most important causal beliefs about their mental illness. Answers were obtained from 678 patients, with primary diagnoses of depression (N = 341), adjustment disorder (N = 75), reaction to severe stress (N = 57) and anxiety disorders (N = 40). Two researchers developed a category system inductively and categorised the reported causal beliefs. Qualitative analysis has been supplemented by logistic regression analyses. Results The causal beliefs were organized into twelve content-related categories. Causal beliefs referring to ``problems at work{''} (47\%) and ``problems in social environment{''} (46\%) were most frequently mentioned by patients with mental disorders. 35\% of patients indicate causal beliefs related to ``self/internal states{''}. Patients with depression and patients with anxiety disorders stated similar causal beliefs, whereas patients with reactions to severe stress and adjustment disorders stated different causal beliefs in comparison to patients with depression. Limitations There was no opportunity for further exploration, because we analysed written documents. Conclusions These results add a detailed insight to mentally ill patients' causal beliefs to illness perception literature. Additionally, evidence about differences in frequencies of causal beliefs between different illness groups complement previous findings.

The paper analyzes current research studies and formulates proposals for three potential areas of poverty research in Slovakia: 1) Finding out what are the causes of poverty in selected population groups and which of them can be considered as its subjective reasons. It is proposed that poverty has been analyzed as a variable of a multi-determinate nature, and so it is desirable to include subjective and objective factors in the research into it. 2) Finding out what are the psychological consequences of poverty for the selected groups of people. A multilevel research appears to be appropriate, i.e. one which takes into account the impact of poverty on different age groups and which distinguishes between immediately-acting factors and mediators. 3) The third recommendation is checking the type of relationships between psychological consequences of poverty and persistence in poverty. It is assumed that there is a double psychological effect of poverty: the negative impact of poverty on the affective aspect of its experiencing has a consequence in the form of persistence in poverty.

Consumers' beliefs around the causes of mental illness are thought to influence stigma and self-stigma. This study aims to investigate the types of causal beliefs consumers endorse about their own mental illness, mental illness in general, and consumers' beliefs about causes endorsed by the public. Moreover, this study explores the impact that these beliefs have on factors that influence stigma and self-stigma. A thematic framework guided the analysis of semi-structured interviews with 23 consumers who self-identified as having mental illness. Consumers endorsed multiple causes simultaneously and causes differed between their own mental illness, thinking about mental illness in general, and the causal beliefs perceived to be held by the public. The majority of consumers thought that mental illness in general was caused by a combination of biogenetic, psychological, and environmental factors. Consumers endorsed fewer causal beliefs when considering their own mental illness, with all consumers stating that environmental factors contributed to their illness. Consumers thought that the public had a narrower range of causal beliefs and tended to think the public believed personal weakness/choice caused mental illness. Findings extend previous research and show that consumers' causal beliefs may have an impact on several factors (e.g., control and management of illness, self-blame, feelings of responsibility, perceptions towards self) which are thought to influence treatment, recovery, and stigma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1080/00207411.2017.1304076,Causal beliefs; consumers mental illness; stigma; thematic analysis;Causality,,

Moreover, community or regional culture has a significant impact on etiology beliefs and attitudes toward the mentally sick. Materials and methods: We carried out this study in Italy and Israel among psychology students to compare two cultures in regards to causal beliefs of mental disorders and the roles that specific variables, such as secure attachment, empathic self-efficacy, and stress, play in etiological beliefs. The participants (N=305) were students who belonged to two universities: Padua (N=183) and Haifa (N=122). The Many Facet Rasch Model (MFRM) was applied in a cross-cultural perspective to analyze the differential functioning of specific etiological beliefs in relation to the above mentioned variables; the effect of gender and religious beliefs was also entered in the MFRM. Results: The two cultures reacted differently to the biogenetic and psychosocial causal explanations of mental disorders: Israeli students endorsed the biogenetic causal beliefs model more frequently than the Italians. Among other findings, concerning the biogenetic model, the Italian students were predominantly males, who declared to be religious and reported lower levels of secure attachment than Israelis. On the other hand, the Israeli students who manifested a preference toward the biogenetic explanation were mostly females, who declared not to be religious and who manifested higher levels of secure attachment than the Italians. Conclusion: This article is expected to contribute to the improvement of the understanding of general public's etiological beliefs of mental illness. Similarities and differences between the two cultures, Israel and Italy, have been highlighted on the basis of the MFRM analysis. The effect that interpersonal relations, such as attachment style, perceived empathy, and stress, have on etiological beliefs was also investigated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.2147/PRBM.S138683,mental illness; stigma; etiological beliefs; attachment; self-efficacy; stress; Italy; Israel; attitudes; empathy;Italy;Israel,,

Seventy seven adolescents, aged between 11 and 17, all diagnosed with moderate to severe depression, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule, at the beginning of their participation in a randomised controlled trial. Data were analysed qualitatively using framework analysis. The study identified three themes related to causal beliefs: (1) bewilderment about why they were depressed; (2) depression as a result of rejection, victimisation, and stress; and (3) something inside is to blame. Although some adolescents struggled to identify the causes of their depression, many identified stressful life experiences as the cause of their current depression. They also tended to emphasise their own negative ways of interpreting those events, and some believed that their depression was caused by something inside them. Adolescents' causal beliefs are likely to have implications for the way they seek help and engage in treatment, making it important to understand how adolescents understand their difficulties.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00787-016-0868-8,Adolescence; Depression; Qualitative; Causal beliefs; Understanding;Mental Health Services;Adolescent;Health Services,,

This adaptation process involved conceptualizing the meaning of OCD, navigating its impact on family dynamics, and developing effective illness management strategies. Adaptation took place against a backdrop of stigmatization and was shaped by participants' family history of mental illness and their child's specific manifestations of OCD. Parents perceived genetic counseling, as described in the vignettes, as being empowering, alleviating guilt and blame, and positively impacting treatment orientation.

Method: We included 45 participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, of which 20 had refused antipsychotic medication for at least three months and assessed reasons for taking or not taking medication, labeling condition as mental disorder ({''}insight{''}), experiences with the previous treatments, symptoms and symptom distress, positive and negative consequences and experiences of psychosis, causal beliefs, therapeutic relationships with previous clinicians and attitudes towards medication. Results: Groups did not differ in symptom severity but medication refusers reported significantly less insight, less satisfaction with their most-recent psychiatrist and with previous medication, and more negative beliefs about harmful effects of medication. They also felt less informed about medication. After controlling for insight, the perceived helpfulness of the previous treating psychiatrist (OR = 0.30, z = 5.58, p = 0.018) and of previous medication (OR = 0.27, z = 6.87, p = 0.009) and feeling insufficiently informed about medication (OR = 0.53, z = 3. 85, p = 0.050) significantly predicted medication discontinuation. Conclusions: Building rapport with patients with a different view of the nature of their condition and encouraging informed decisions on medication are likely to improve medication adherence.

Research in other disorders suggests that genetic causal attributions can influence patients' psychological responses and coping strategies, but little is known about how epilepsy patients and their relatives will respond to genetic attributions of epilepsy. We investigated the possibility that among members of families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy, depression, the most frequent psychiatric comorbidity in the epilepsies, might be related to the perception that epilepsy has a genetic cause. Methods: A self-administered survey was completed by 417 individuals in 104 families averaging 4 individuals with epilepsy per family. Current depression was measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire. Genetic causal attribution was assessed by three questions addressing the following: perceived likelihood of having an epilepsy-related mutation, perceived role of genetics in causing epilepsy in the family, and (in individuals with epilepsy) perceived influence of genetics in causing the individual's epilepsy. Relatives without epilepsy were asked about their perceived chance of developing epilepsy in the future, compared with the average person. Results: Prevalence of current depression was 14.8\% in 182 individuals with epilepsy, 6.5\% in 184 biologic relatives without epilepsy, and 3.9\% in 51 individuals married into the families. Among individuals with epilepsy, depression was unrelated to genetic attribution. Among biologic relatives without epilepsy, however, prevalence of depression increased with increasing perceived chance of having an epilepsy-related mutation (p = 0.02). This association was not mediated by perceived future epilepsy risk among relatives without epilepsy. Significance: Depression is associated with perceived likelihood of carrying an epilepsy-related mutation among individuals without epilepsy in families containing multiple affected individuals. This association should be considered when addressing mental health issues in such families.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/epi.13500,Epilepsy; Epidemiology; Genetics; Depression; Genetic attribution;Epilepsy;Depression;Causality,,

This study examined causal beliefs about intellectual disability and schizophrenia and how these relate to awareness of the condition and social distance. UK lay people aged 16+(N=1752), in response to vignettes depicting intellectual disability and schizophrenia, noted their interpretation of the difficulties, and rated their agreement with 22 causal and four social distance items. They were most likely to endorse environmental causes for intellectual disability, and biomedical factors, trauma and early disadvantage for schizophrenia. Accurate identification of both vignettes was associated with stronger endorsement of biomedical causes, alongside weaker endorsement of adversity, environmental and supernatural causes. Biomedical causal beliefs and social distance were negatively correlated for intellectual disability, but not for schizophrenia. Causal beliefs mediated the relationship between identification of the condition and social distance for both conditions. While all four types of causal beliefs acted as mediators for intellectual disability, for schizophrenia only supernatural causal beliefs did. Educating the public and promoting certain causal beliefs may be of benefit in tackling intellectual disability stigma, but for schizophrenia, other than tackling supernatural attributions, may be of little benefit in reducing stigma.

As a result, mental health services in the region are being redefined and expanded. However, there is a paucity of local research to guide ongoing service development. Local research is important because service users' experience of mental illness and mental health services are linked to their sociocultural context. In order for service development to be most effective, there is a need for increased understanding of the people who use these services. This article aims to review and synthesize mental health research from the Gulf Cooperation Council. It also seeks to identify gaps in the literature and suggest directions for future research. A scoping framework was used to conduct this review. To identify studies, database searches were undertaken, regional journals were hand-searched, and reference lists of included articles were examined. Empirical studies undertaken in the Gulf Cooperation Council that reported mental health service users' experience of mental illness were included. Framework analysis was used to synthesize results. Fifty-five studies met inclusion criteria and the following themes were identified: service preferences, illness (symptomology, perceived cause, impact), and recovery (traditional healing, family support, religion). Gaps included contradictory findings related to the supportive role of the Arabic extended family and religion, under-representation of women in study samples, and limited attention on illness management outside of the hospital setting. From this review, it is clear that the sociocultural context in the region is linked to service users' experience of mental illness. Future research that aims to fill the identified gaps and develop and test culturally appropriate interventions will aid practice and policy development in the region.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s12961-016-0123-2,Arabs; Mental disorders; Mental health; Mental health services; Middle East; Qatar; Scoping review;Mentally Ill Persons,,

Participants viewed weight-related information about a target individual and evaluated that target on various dimensions. Study 1 showed that offset effort information (i.e., information about effort to lose weight) had a greater impact on participants' evaluations of individuals with obesity than did other causal information, such as onset control and offset ability. Study 2 extended this finding by demonstrating that the duration of effort invested to lose weight is also important in determining participants' evaluations of individuals with obesity. Study 3 replicated the effect of effort (albeit in terms of effort to maintain a healthy lifestyle) on evaluations of individuals without obesity. Furthermore, in all 3 studies, disgust mediated the association between perceived effort and desire for social distance from the target. These findings highlight a key role for effort and disgust in weight stigma, and suggest that the negative evaluations of individuals with obesity might in part reflect a pro-effort bias.

We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 12 depressed and 9 nondepressed pregnant women and mothers of young babies, and 13 health care providers. We employed an in-depth framework analysis approach to explore the idioms, descriptions, and perceived causes of depression particular to these women, and compared these with the ICD-10 and DSM-5 criteria for major depression. We found that symptoms of major depression are similar in this township to those described in international criteria (withdrawal, sadness, and poor concentration), but that local descriptions of these symptoms vary. In addition, all the symptoms described by participants were directly related to stressors occurring in the women's lives. These stressors included poverty, unemployment, lack of support from partners, abuse, and death of loved ones, and were exacerbated by unwanted or unplanned pregnancies and the discovery of HIV positive status at antenatal appointments.

The results indicate that biological attributions, regardless of the presence or absence of treatability information, can reduce stereotypes about the mentally ill, lower help-seeking stigma, and increase willingness to seek a psychiatrist, compared to psychosocial attributions. The decrease in help-seeking stigma accounts for the effect of attributions-on willingness to seek help.

Results indicated that SAAs were significantly more likely than whites to perceive character deficits as the cause of MI. Further, among those who had sought help for MI, ethnic differences emerged in perceptions of MI based on perceived cause. SAAs who believed that MI had biological origins perceived more shame and less family support for seeking help compared to SAAs who believed MI was due to character deficits. The converse was true for whites - those who believed that MI had biological origins perceived less shame and more family support for help seeking compared to whites who believed MI was due to character deficits.

Method: Mental health professionals (n = 265) viewed a videotape of a patient suffering from panic disorder and agoraphobia undergoing assessment. Prior to viewing the videotape, participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions and were given the following information about the patient: (a) general background information; (b) additional descriptive information about behaviour corresponding to BPD; and (c) additional descriptive information about behaviour corresponding to BPD, but explicitly adding BPD as a possible comorbid diagnostic label. All participants were then asked to note things they had seen in the videotape that made them feel optimistic or pessimistic about treatment outcome. Results: Participants in the group that were explicitly informed that the patient had a BPD diagnostic label reported significantly fewer reasons to be optimistic than the other two groups. Conclusions: Diagnostic labels may negatively impact on clinicians' judgments and perceptions of individuals and therefore clinicians should think carefully about whether, and how, they use diagnoses and efforts should be made to destigmatize diagnostic terms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1017/S1352465815000351,Borderline personality disorder; panic disorder; diagnosis,,

In this cross-sectional postal survey, questionnaires were sent to member physicians of the Japan College of Rheumatology and Japan Rheumatism Foundation. Measures collected included the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire with Causal Attribution, the Illness Invalidation Inventory, and the Difficult Doctor-Patient Relationship Questionnaire (DDPRQ-10). Multiple logistic regression was performed to examine associations between the DDPRQ-10 and resistance to accepting patients with FM for treatment. We analyzed data from 233 physicians who had experience in consulting with patients with FM. Only 44.2 \% answered that they wanted to accept additional patients with FM. Physicians' frustration was associated with difficulty controlling symptoms, patients' emotional responses, and causal attribution of FM to patient internal factors. Conversely, lower levels of frustration were associated with causal attributions to biological factors and uncontrollable external factors. However, the ``difficult patient{''} perception did not correlate with resistance to accepting patients with FM. Difficulty controlling symptoms with treatment was the one factor common to both physicians' frustration and resistance to accepting patients with FM. Physicians may hesitate to accept patients with FM not because of the stigmatic image of the ``difficult patient,{''} but instead because of the difficulty in controlling the symptoms of FM.

Yet, a large amount of literature suggests that migration is associated with a higher risk of common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. As representatives of one of the largest immigrant groups in Europe, various studies have shown that Turkish immigrants exhibit a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders than do the background population. Nevertheless, it is also well demonstrated that this particular patient group is more likely to terminate treatment prematurely and displays lower rates of treatment compliance than their native counterparts. This reluctance for service utilization might be partially because of the fact that people from non-Western ethno-cultural backgrounds (e.g., Turkey) often have a different notion and comprehension of mental health and illness as compared with those of the people from Western societies. Such mismatch often results in discrepancies between the needs and expectations of immigrant patients and clinicians, which attenuate the communication and effectiveness of treatment and lead to unexplained high dropout rates. To provide continued provision of culture-sensitive, high quality, evidence-based mental health care, the advancement of researches exploring such sociocultural differences between the patients' and the clinicians' notions of mental health must occur. In response to these problems, the current review aims to explore the interplay between culture and mental processes that associate with the etiology, maintenance, and management of depression among Turkish immigrant patients. This is to inform clinicians regarding culture-specific correlates of depression among Turkish patients to enable them to present interventions that fit the needs and expectations of this particular patient group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.5152/npa.2016.12666,Culture; immigration; mental health; depression; psychotherapy;Psychotherapy;Europe,,

MethodA total of 1264 adult members of the UK general population completed measures of symptom recognition, social distance (as measure of external stigma) and causal beliefs in response to a diagnostically unlabelled vignette, depicting someone with intellectual disabilities. ResultsA nuanced contact variable, including frequency of contact and closeness and nature of the contact relationship, explained more of the variance in social distance, compared to the binary variable (contact as present or absent). Only the closeness of the relationship was individually predictive though, and the models explained only relatively small amounts of the variance. Structural equation modelling of contact, recognition, social distance and causal beliefs demonstrated that the model including the nuanced variable was an adequate fit for the data.

Method: One hundred and sixty-five university students read one of three vignettes describing a person who stutters with different descriptions about the cause of stuttering (low control, high control, and a control group in which no explanation was given) and answered a series of self-report measures assessing stigmatizing attitudes and perceived potential for recovery. Results: The controllable explanation for stuttering led to more blame compared to the uncontrollable explanation and no explanation. The controllable explanation resulted in higher levels of anger and stereotypes compared to no explanation. There were no significant differences between uncontrollable explanations and no explanation on any of the stigma related variables of interest. Uncontrollable explanations increased prognostic pessimism compared to controllable explanations. Self-reported familiarity and closeness with people who stutter was significantly related to more positive attitudes toward a hypothetical person who stutters. Conclusions: Reducing the belief that stuttering is ultimately caused by psychobehavioral factors will reduce blame toward people who stutter. However, providing biological explanations for stuttering is not effective for reducing stigma compared to no explanation at all, and could increase prognostic pessimism. Biological explanations for stuttering should be provided to inform clients and society about current research findings, however this information must be given carefully and be balanced with evidence that people who stutter can make great progress with appropriate, personalized therapy that addresses the multidimensionality of the disorder.

Couples also engaged in a videotaped marital conflict interaction, which was later coded for specific conflict behaviors.

The findings suggest that, for husbands, low levels of negative marital attributions for spouses may be protective, strengthening the positive effect of constructive conflict behaviors for their mental health, whereas for wives low levels of responsibility attributions about their spouse may be a risk factor, exacerbating the negative effect of negative marital conflict behaviors on their later depressive symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1037/fam0000181,depressive symptoms; marital attributions; marital conflict; responsibility attributions; causal attributions,,

White British parents perceived that the OCD difficulties would have more negative impact on their children and that treatment would be more helpful, compared to the ethnic minorities; the largest differences were observed between White British and Indian parents. Ethnic minorities were more prone to say that would seek help from their religious communities. Black African parents were more in favor of not seeking help for the described difficulties and, in general, perceived more treatment barriers. White British parents seemed to be better informed about OCD than ethnic minority parents. The results offer some plausible explanations for the large inequalities in access to services amongst ethnic minorities with OCD. Clinicians and policy-makers need to be aware of these socio-cultural factors when designing strategies to encourage help-seeking behaviors in these populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00127-015-1144-9,Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Ethnic minorities; Health disparities; Parental beliefs; Help-seeking;Ethnic Groups;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,,

Method: Ninety-five adolescents aged 14 to 17 recruited from mainstream schools, with varying levels of social anxiety rated the likelihood of positive, negative and unrelated interpretations before selecting the single interpretation they deemed as most likely. This was followed by a question prompting them to decide between an internal or external causal attribution for the interpreted event. Results: Across scenarios, adolescents with higher levels of social anxiety rated negative interpretations as more likely and positive interpretations as less likely compared to lower socially anxious adolescents. Higher socially anxious adolescents were also more likely to select internal attributions to negative and less likely to select internal attributions for positive events than adolescents with lower levels of social anxiety. Conclusions: Adolescents with higher social anxiety display cognitive biases in interpretation and attribution. This tool is suitable for measuring cognitive biases of complex visual-social cues in youth populations with social anxiety and simulates the demands of daily social experiences more closely. Limitations: As we did not measure depressive symptoms, we cannot be sure that biases linked to social anxiety are not due to concurrent low mood.

This research investigated how biological and psychosocial explanations for a child's ADHD symptoms differ in affecting laypeople's stigmatizing attitudes and prognostic beliefs. Method: Three experiments were conducted online with U.S. adults, using vignettes that described a child with ADHD and attributed his symptoms to either biological or psychosocial causes. Dependent measures gauged social distance and expectations about the child's prognosis. Results: Across all three studies, the biological explanation yielded more doubt about treatability but less social distancea result that diverges from previous research with other disorders. Differences in the amount of blame ascribed to the child mediated the social distance effect. Conclusion: The effects of biological explanations on laypeople's views of ADHD seem to be a double-edged sword, reducing social rejection but exacerbating perceptions of the disorder as relatively untreatable.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not sure if ADHD counts as mental illness",10.1177/1087054712469255,ADHD; stigma; attitudes; causal attributions; biological explanations;Only Child;Child;Stereotyping,,

Chi-square and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to compare age and gender of the samples. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to confirm the structure and fit of the hypothesized model based on data from a previous study that identified four factors: socializing with people with mental illness (socializing), belief that people with mental illness should have normal roles in society (normalizing), non-belief in supernatural causes (witchcraft or curses), and belief in bio-psycho-social causes of mental illness (bio-psycho-social). Analysis of Covariance was used to compare four factor scores across countries adjusting for differences in age and gender. Scores on all four factors were highest among U.S. professionals. The Chinese sample showed lowest score on socializing and normalizing while the Nigerian and Ghanaian samples were lowest on non-belief in supernatural causes of mental illness.

Method: The study employed a cross-sectional design using a web survey distribution mode to gain information related to causal attributions and psychological well-being of 348 adults who stutter. Correlation analyses were conducted to determine relationships between participants' causal attributions (i.e. locus of causality, external control, personal control, stability, biological attributions, non-biological attributions) for stuttering and various measures of psychological well-being including self-stigma, self-esteem/self-efficacy, hope, anxiety and depression. Result: Results indicated that higher perceptions of external control of stuttering were related to significantly lower ratings of hope and self-esteem/self-efficacy and higher ratings of anxiety and depression. Higher perceptions of personal control of stuttering were related to significantly lower ratings of self-stigma and higher ratings of hope and self-esteem/self-efficacy. Increased biological attributions were significantly related to higher ratings of permanency and unchangeableness of stuttering and lower ratings of personal control of stuttering.

Attitudes and beliefs of lay individuals about mental illness are shaped by personal knowledge about mental illness, knowing and interacting with someone living with mental illness, and cultural stereotypes. Mental health issues are increasing and are alarming in almost every part of the world, and hence compiling this review provides an opportunity to understand the different views regarding mental disorders and problems as well as to fill the gap in the published literature by focusing only on the belief system and perception of mental health problems among general population. Method: The methodology involved a systematic review and the meta-synthesis method, which includes synthesizing published qualitative studies on mental health perception and beliefs. Sample: Fifteen relevant published qualitative and mixed-method studies, regarding the concept of mental health, were identified for meta-synthesis. Analysis: All the themes of the selected studies were further analyzed to give a broader picture of mental health problems and their perceived causes and management. Only qualitative studies, not older than 2010, focusing on beliefs about, attitudes toward, and perceptions of mental health problems, causes, and treatments were included in this review. Results: The findings are divided into four major categories, namely, 1) symptoms of mental health issues, 2) description of mental health issues, 3) perceived causes, and 4) preferred treatment and help-seeking behavior. Each category contains themes and subthemes based on published studies. Conclusion: The findings reveal multiple causes of, descriptions of, and treatment options for mental health problems, thereby providing insight into different help-seeking behaviors. Clarity is offered by highlighting cultural differences and similarities in mental health beliefs and perceptions about the causes of mental health problems.

On the other hand, cross-cultural studies and cultural psychopathology show that cultural variations exist in perceived causes, onset patterns, epidemiology, symptom expression, course and outcome; yet, by promoting the view of culture as the context container to which individuals belong, this standpoint neglects the role of individuals in negotiating their cultural world and the meaning of their experience. In this chapter, gambling will be used as an argument to highlight the limits both of individualistic perspectives and of a view of culture as a monolithic entity. According to a cultural and semiotic perspective stating the dialectic unity of mind and context, we argue the field dependent dynamic and inherently unique nature of psychopathology and suggest modelling it at the same time as an intrapsychic, interpersonal and cultural process.

This association also has translated into verdict and sentencing decisions in insanity cases, such that higher endorsement of fundamentalist beliefs was associated with more punitive decisions. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between fundamentalism and insanity defense attitudes is unclear. Two possible explanations for this relationship include that (a) fundamentalism is associated with more dispositional attributions, and (b) fundamentalism is associated with more authoritarian attitudes toward mental illness and the mentally ill. Using structural equation modeling, attributions and attitudes were tested as mediators of the relationship between fundamentalism and insanity defense attitudes (i.e., strict liability attitudes and injustice-danger attitudes). These relationships were examined for theists and nontheists separately. Results suggest that personal attributions mediate the relationship between fundamentalism and injustice-danger attitudes, but authoritarian attitudes mediated the relationship between fundamentalism and strict liability attitudes.

In 2011, over 10 million adults felt that even though they needed treatment for mental health problems, they received insufficient or no mental health care and reported unmet need. This article assesses associations between sociodemographic characteristics and perceived causes of unmet needs for mental health care. Method: A sample of 2,564 adults with unmet mental health need was obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Outcome variables were 5 main reasons for unmet need: cost, stigma, minimization, low perceived treatment effectiveness, and structural barriers. Each cause of unmet need was regressed on sociodemographic, health, and service use characteristics. Women had higher odds of cost-related reasons for unmet need than men. Odds of stigma and structural bathers were greater among Blacks than Whites, and among rural than metropolitan residents. Compared with the uninsured, insured persons were less likely to report cost bathers. However, insured persons had higher odds of stigma and minimization of mental disorders. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Insurance alone is unlikely to resolve the problem of unmet need. Understanding the social epidemiology of perceived unmet need will help identify populations at risk of not receiving mental health care or insufficient care. Focusing on specific programs and services that are designed to address the causes of perceived unmet need in particular populations is important.

Methods A total of 2052 representative rural residents aged 18-60 completed a cross-sectional survey by face-to-face interviews. The survey included seven questions asking about respondents' help-seeking intentions and preferences, and a series of internationally validated instruments to assess self-perceived health status, depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, mental health literacy, and attitudes towards mental illness. Results Nearly 80\% of respondents were willing to seek psychological help if needed, and 72.4\% preferred to get help from medical organizations, yet only 12\% knew of any hospitals or clinics providing such help. A multivariate analysis of help-seeking intention revealed that being female, having lower education, higher social health, higher mental health knowledge, and physical causal attribution for depression were positive predictors of help-seeking intention. Conclusion A huge gap exists between the relatively higher intention for help-seeking and significantly lower knowledge of helpful resources. Predictors of help-seeking intention for mental problems in the current study are consistent with previous studies. Interventions to increase help-seeking for mental problems by Chinese rural adults may be best served by focusing on increasing public awareness of help sources, as well as improving residents' mental health literacy and social health, with special focus on males and those more educated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0141889,Mental Health,,

We investigated this hypothesis in a unique sample of families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy. MethodsOne hundred eighty-one people with epilepsy and 178 biologic relatives without epilepsy completed a self-administered survey. In people with epilepsy, felt stigma was assessed through the Epilepsy Stigma Scale (ESS), scored 1-7, with higher scores indicating more stigma and >4 indicating some felt stigma. Felt stigma related to having epilepsy in the family was assessed through the Family Epilepsy Stigma Scale (FESS), created by replacing epilepsy with epilepsy in my family in each ESS item. Genetic attribution was assessed through participants' perceptions of the (1) role of genetics in causing epilepsy in the family, (2) chance they had an epilepsy-related mutation, and (3) (in people with epilepsy) influence of genetics in causing their epilepsy. ResultsAmong people with epilepsy, 22\% met criteria for felt stigma (ESS score >4). Scores were increased among individuals who were aged 60years, were unemployed, reported epilepsy-related discrimination, or had seizures within the last year or >100 seizures in their lifetime. Adjusting for other variables, ESS scores in people with epilepsy were significantly higher among those who perceived genetics played a medium or big role in causing epilepsy in the family than in others (3.4 vs. 2.7, p=0.025). Only 4\% of relatives without epilepsy had felt stigma. Scores in relatives were unrelated to genetic attribution. SignificanceIn these unusual families, predictors of felt stigma in individuals with epilepsy are similar to those in other studies, and stigma levels are low in relatives without epilepsy. Felt stigma may be increased in people with epilepsy who believe epilepsy in the family has a genetic cause, emphasizing the need for sensitive communication about genetics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/epi.13113,Genetics; Epidemiology; Survey; Genetic attribution; Stigma;Epilepsy;Causality,,

We validated measures of MHL in European American and Indian samples. The results lend strong quantitative support to the MHL model. Recognition of symptoms of mental illness was a central variable: greater recognition predicted greater endorsement of social causes of mental illness and endorsement of professional help-seeking as well as lesser endorsement of lay help seeking. The MHL model also showed an overwhelming cultural difference; namely, lay help-seeking beliefs played a central role in the Indian sample, and a negligible role in the European American sample.

Prevention requires knowledge of how individuals perceive causal mechanisms, and in this study we sought to examine work-related factors as causal attribution of CMDs. Methods A trial sample of n = 1,193, recruited because they struggled with work participation due to CMDs, answered an open-ended questionnaire item about what they believed were the most important causes of their CMDs. The population included participants at risk of sickness absence, and participants with reduced work participation due to sickness absence, disability or unemployment. We used thematic content analysis and categorized responses from 487 participants who reported work-related factors as causal attributions of their CMDs. Gender differences in work-related causal attributions were also examined. Results The participants attributed their CMDs to the following work-related factors; work stress, leadership, reduced work participation, job dissatisfaction, work conflict, social work environment, job insecurity and change, workplace bullying, and physical strain. Women tended to attribute CMDs to social factors at work. Conclusion Findings from this study suggest several work-related risk factors for CMDs. Both factors at the workplace, and reduced work participation, were perceived by study participants as contributing causes of CMDs. Thus, there is a need to promote work participation whilst at the same time targeting aversive workplace factors. Further, our findings indicate that work-related factors may affect women and men differently. This illustrates that the association between work participation and CMDs is complex, and needs to be explored further.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10926-014-9556-z,Occupational health; Mental disorders; Return to work (RTW);Mental Disorders;Causality,,

Previous population-based studies did not support the view that biological and genetic causal models help increase social acceptance of people with mental illness. However, practically all these studies used un-labelled vignettes depicting symptoms of the disorders of interest. Thus, in these studies the public's reactions to pathological behaviour had been assessed rather than reactions to psychiatric disorders that had explicitly been labelled as such. The question arises as to whether results would have been similar if respondents had been confronted with vignettes with explicit mention of the respective diagnosis. Methods. Analyses are based on data of a telephone survey in two German metropolises conducted in 2011. Case-vignettes with typical symptoms suggestive of depression or schizophrenia were presented to the respondents. After presentation of the vignette respondents were informed about the diagnosis. Results. We found a statistically significant association of the endorsement of brain disease as a cause with greater desire for social distance from persons with schizophrenia. In major depression, this relation was absent. With both disorders, there was no statistically significant association between the endorsement of hereditary factors as a cause and social distance. Conclusions. Irrespective of whether unlabelled or labelled vignettes are employed, the ascription to biological or genetic causes seems not to be associated with a reduction of the public's desire for social distance from people with schizophrenia or depression. Our results corroborate the notion that promulgating biological and genetic causal models may not help decrease the stigma surrounding these illnesses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1017/S2045796014000262,Causal attributions; major depression; schizophrenia; social distance;Schizophrenia;Social Desirability,,

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) leads to a significant decrease in CFS-related symptoms and disability. The primary objective of this study was to explore whether partners' solicitous responses and patients' and partners' perceived relationship satisfaction had an effect on treatment outcome. Method. The treatment outcome of a cohort of 204 consecutively referred patients treated with CBT was analysed. At baseline, CFS patients completed the Maudsley Marital Questionnaire. The Checklist Individual Strength subscale Fatigue and the Sickness Impact Profile total scores completed by CFS patients post-treatment were used as measures of clinically significant improvement. Partners completed the Family Response Questionnaire, the Maudsley Marital Questionnaire, the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, and the Causal Attribution List. Logistic regression analyses were performed with clinically significant improvement in fatigue and disability as dependent variables and scores on questionnaires at baseline as predictors. Results. Solicitous responses of the partner were associated with less clinically significant improvement in fatigue and disability. Partners more often reported solicitous responses when they perceived CFS as a severe condition. Patients' relationship dissatisfaction was negatively associated with clinically significant improvement in fatigue. Conclusions. Partners' solicitous responses and illness perceptions at the start of the therapy can negatively affect the outcome of CBT for CFS. We emphasize the importance of addressing this in therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1017/S0033291715000288,"Chronic fatigue syndrome; cognitive behavioural model; cognitive behavioural therapy; illness perceptions; partner relationship; partners' responses; relationship satisfaction; social support;Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic",,

Findings indicated that among both populations, close supportive ties with family members and friends are protective against meeting criteria for SAD. Negative interactions with family (e.g., conflicts), however, are a risk factor for SAD among both African Americans and Black Caribbeans. For African Americans, an interaction indicates that the relationship between negative interaction and social anxiety is much stronger among African Americans who are not emotionally close to their families. For Caribbean Blacks, an interaction suggests that the odds of meeting criteria for SAD were higher among Black Caribbeans who had high negative interaction with family as well as low levels of friendship closeness.

This paper describes the causes of suicide attempts as perceived by the men themselves and analyzes their impact on severity and recidivism. Mental health surveys conducted among gay men in Geneva, Switzerland, from two probability-based time-space samples in 2007 and 2011, were merged to yield a combined sample N = 762. Suicide ideation, plans, and attempts were assessed, and respondents who had ever attempted suicide answered open questions about perceived causes which were coded and categorized for analysis within the framework of cultural epidemiology. In all, 16.7\% of the respondents reported a suicide attempt in their lifetime (59.5\% of them with multiple attempts). At their latest attempt, over two thirds asserted intent to die, and half required medical assistance. There was a wide variety of perceived causes, with most individuals reporting multiple causes and many of the most common causes cited at both the first and most recent subsequent attempts. Social/ inter-personal problems constitute the most prominent category. Problems with love/relationship and accepting one's homosexuality figure consistently among the top three causes. Whereas the former tend to be associated with weaker intent to die, the latter are associated with the strongest intent to die and reported at multiple attempts. Problems with family are among the most common perceived causes at first attempt but not at the most recent subsequent attempt. Nevertheless, they tend to be related to the strongest intent to die and the greatest medical severity of all the perceived causes. Ten percent of men attempting suicide cited depression as a cause. Although it tended to be associated with weaker intent to die, depression was most likely to be reported at multiple attempts. Respondent-driven assessment yielded both common and idiosyncratic causes of suicide and their distinct effects. Some of these perceived causes are not prominent in the current literature, yet they have important implications for understanding risk and preventing suicide among gay men.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1097/NMD.0000000000000319,"Suicide; recidivism; cultural epidemiology; life events; homosexuality;Homosexuality, Male;Suicide, Attempted;Suicide",,

School can be particularly challenging for children with ADHD. Few reviews have considered non-pharmacological interventions in school settings. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions delivered in school settings for pupils with, or at risk of, ADHD and to explore the factors that may enhance, or limit, their delivery. Data sources: Twenty electronic databases (including PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Education Resources Information Centre, The Cochrane Library and Education Research Complete) were searched from 1980 to February-August 2013. Three separate searches were conducted for four systematic reviews; they were supplemented with forward and backwards citation chasing, website searching, author recommendations and hand-searches of key journals. Review methods: The systematic reviews focused on (1) the effectiveness of school-based interventions for children with or at risk of ADHD; (2) quantitative research that explores attitudes towards school-based non-pharmacological interventions for pupils with ADHD; (3) qualitative research investigating the attitudes and experiences of children, teachers, parents and others using ADHD interventions in school settings; and (4) qualitative research exploring the experience of ADHD in school among pupils, their parents and teachers more generally. Methods of synthesis included a random-effects meta-analysis, meta-regression and narrative synthesis for review 1, narrative synthesis for review 2 and meta-ethnography and thematic analysis for reviews 3 and 4. Results: For review 1, 54 controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. For the 36 meta-analysed randomised controlled trials, beneficial effects (p < 0.05) were observed for several symptom and scholastic outcomes. Mean weighted effect sizes ranged from very small (d(+) < 0.20) to large (d(+) >= 0.80), but substantial heterogeneity in effect size estimates across studies was reported. Moderator analyses were not able to clarify which intervention features were linked with effectiveness. For review 2, 28 included studies revealed that educators' attitudes towards interventions ranged in positivity. Most interventions were rated positively or neutrally across different studies. The only intervention that consistently recorded positive attitudes from educators was daily report cards. For review 3, 33 studies met the inclusion criteria. Key findings included tensions regarding the preferred format of interventions, particularly how structured interventions were and the extent to which they are tailored to the child with ADHD. There were mixed views about the impact of interventions, although it was clear that interventions both influence and are influenced by the relationships held by children with ADHD and participants' attitudes towards school and ADHD. For review 4, 34 studies met the inclusion criteria. Key findings included the importance of causal attributions that teachers, parents and pupils made about ADHD symptoms, the decisions teachers made about treatment, the self-perceptions pupils developed about themselves, the role of the classroom environment and stigma in aggravating ADHD symptoms, and the significant barrier to treatment posed by the common presence of conflict in relationships between pupils-teachers, parents-teachers and pupils-peers in relation to ADHD. An overarching synthesis of the four reviews highlighted the importance of the context affecting interventions. It suggested that ADHD psychoeducation and relationship-building skills are potential implications for interventions. Limitations: The breadth of both interventions and outcomes in the reviewed studies presented a challenge for categorisation, analysis and interpretation in reviews 1-3. Across reviews, relatively few studies were conducted in the UK, limiting the applicability of findings to UK education. In reviews 1 and 2, the poor methodological quality of some included studies was identified as a barrier to establishing effectiveness or comparing attitudes. In review 3 the descriptive analysis used by the majority of studies constrained theorising during synthesis. Studies in review 4 lacked detail regarding important issues like gender, pupil maturity and school level. Conclusion: Findings suggest some beneficial effects of non-pharmacological interventions for ADHD used in school settings, but substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes was seen across studies. The qualitative reviews demonstrate the importance of the context in which interventions are used. Future work should consider more rigorous evaluation of interventions, as well as focus on what works, for whom and in which contexts. Gaps in current research present opportunities for the development and testing of standardised tools to describe interventions, agreement on gold-standard outcome measures assessing ADHD behaviour and testing a range of potential moderators alongside intervention trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.3310/hta19450,"",,

This study investigates changes to the emotional wellbeing of nonmigrant mothers when their partners reside in the United States. We hypothesize that partner migration affects mothers' wellbeing through three pathways: directly via the toll of spousal separation, and indirectly via changes to the economic profile of the sending household and through changes to mothers' household responsibilities. We test these relationships using data on 2813 mothers aged 18-44 in 2002 and measured in three waves (2002, 2005, 2009) of the Mexican Family Life Survey. We employ a fixed-effect estimation strategy that improves causal attribution of women's wellbeing to spousal residential location. We find evidence of increases in some forms of distress sadness, crying, difficulty sleeping when spouses are in the United States but no meaningful increase in depressive symptomology. Though partner emigration shifts several aspects of women's lives in sending households, changes to household resources or time allocation do not account for the moderate shifts in emotional duress associated with spousal absence. Importantly, additional tests reveal that we would observe large and significant associations between spousal migration and mothers' emotional wellbeing using a less rigorous estimation strategy, raising caution about the interpretation of cross-sectional studies evaluating wellbeing in sending homes.

Simon and Kelly, Patrick J. and Chen, Timothy F.",,English,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA","Background: Pharmacists' provision of medication counseling and medication review has been shown to improve adherence and resolve drug-related problems. Lack of knowledge of mental health conditions and negative beliefs may act as a barrier to the provision of pharmacy services. It is unclear how pharmacists' knowledge and attitudes impact their provision of pharmacy services. Objectives: To explore the relationship between pharmacists' level of mental health stigma, mental health literacy and behavioral intentions in relation to providing pharmacy services for consumers with schizophrenia. Methods: A survey instrument containing a measure of mental health literacy, the 7-item social distance scale, and 16 items relating to the provision of pharmacy services for consumers with schizophrenia compared to cardiovascular disease, was mailed to a random sample of 1000 pharmacists registered with the Pharmacy Board of New South Wales in November 2009. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between stigma, knowledge and behavior. Results: Responses were received from 188 pharmacists. Pharmacists were significantly more confident and comfortable to provide services to consumers with a cardiovascular illness than a mental illness. Social distance, beta = -0.11 (95\% CI: -0.22, -0.01, P = 0.03), and schizophrenia literacy scores, beta = 1.02, (95\% CI: 0.54, 1.50, P < 0.001), were strongly associated with willingness to provide medication counseling. Schizophrenia literacy was also a predictor of identifying drug-related problems, beta = 1.09 (95\% CI: 0.39, 1.79, beta = 0.002). Conclusions: Low levels of mental health stigma and high levels of schizophrenia literacy were associated with pharmacists being more willing to provide medication counseling and identify drug-related problems for consumers with schizophrenia. This demonstrates the importance of improving knowledge and stigma surrounding schizophrenia to improve service delivery for consumers taking medications for schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study explored public beliefs and attitudes towards bipolar disorder and examined the relationship between these different components of stigma. Method: Using an online questionnaire distributed via email, social networking sites and public institutions, 753 members of the UK population were presented with a vignette depicting someone who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder. Causal beliefs, beliefs about prognosis, emotional reactions, stereotypes, and social distance were assessed in response to the vignette. Preacher and Hayes procedure for estimating direct and indirect effects of multiple mediators was used to examine the relationship between these components of stigma. Results: Bipolar disorder was primarily associated with positive beliefs and attitudes and elicited a relatively low desire for social distance. Fear partially mediated the relationship between stereotypes and social distance. Biomedical causal beliefs reduced desire for social distance by increasing compassion, whereas fate causal beliefs increased it through eliciting fear. Psychosocial causal beliefs had mixed effects. Limitations: The measurement of stigma using vignettes and self-report questionnaires has implications for ecological validity and participants may have been reluctant to reveal the true extent of their negative attitudes. Conclusions: Dissemination of these findings to people with bipolar disorder has implications for the reduction of internalised stigma in this population. Anti stigma campaigns should attend to causal beliefs, stereotypes and emotional reactions as these all play a vital role in discriminatory behaviour towards people with bipolar disorder.

Method: An online survey on a range of beliefs about depression, and experiences with antidepressants, was completed by 1829 New Zealand adults prescribed anti-depressants in the preceding five years, 97.4\% of whom proceeded to take antidepressants. Results: Six of 17 beliefs about the causes of their own depression were endorsed by more than half the sample: chemical imbalance, family stress, work stress, heredity, relationship problems and distressing events in childhood. There were some marked differences in content, structure and level of conviction of beliefs about one's own depression and the sample's previously published beliefs about depression in general. There were also significant differences between the beliefs of demographic groupings. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported effectiveness of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs. The quality of the relationship with the prescribing doctor was positively related to a belief in chemical imbalance as a cause and negatively related to a belief in unemployment as a cause. Limitations: The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bin genetic explanations, since 83\% reported that the medication reduced their depression. Conclusions: People experiencing depression hold complex, multifactorial and idiosyncratic sets of beliefs about the causes of their own depression, apparently based at least in part on their own life experiences and circumstances. Exploring those beliefs may enhance the doctor patient relationship and selection of appropriate treatment modality.

Ethnic background plays an important role in the formation of beliefs regarding the causes of schizophrenia, and there have been no prior studies on such beliefs among the Aymara, an indigenous community with a population of about 2million people living in the Andes. We focused on three systems of beliefs distinguished in the literature: biological, psychosocial and magical-religious. Methods: The sample comprised 253 patients (n=117 Aymara, and n=136 non-Aymara) of public mental health centers in Chile (33.6\%), Peru (33.6\%) and Bolivia (32.8\%) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and each patient's primary caregiver. We administered to patients and caregivers a questionnaire with scales assessing the perceived causes of schizophrenia. Linear regression models were fitted to compare differences in the levels of causal beliefs between Aymara and non-Aymara patients and caregivers, and to identify socio-demographic and clinical predictors of different types of beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia. Results: Adjusted for socio-demographic and clinical covariates, levels of psychosocial beliefs were significantly higher for Aymara caregivers (0.33, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.05, 0.62) than non-Aymara caregivers. Conclusions: Contrary to expectations, beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia among Aymara are not more magical-religious than those of their non-Aymara counterparts.

To clarify the concept of `expressed emotion' and its application to caregivers of older adults with dementia. Background. Expressed emotion has been a useful construct for understanding the quality of family relationships affecting patients with mental illness and their caregivers. However, this concept has been developed without precisely defining `expressed emotion' as it pertains to dementia patients. Clarity regarding expressed emotion will enable nurses to apply knowledge of expressed emotion and provide important information for the development of new clinical interventions for this specific population. Design. Integrative review. Methods. A review of literature on expressed emotion by caregivers of older adults with dementia. The inclusion criteria were: (1) published in English or Chinese during 1970-2012; (2) included both research and theoretical review articles on expressed emotion in nursing and other disciplines such as psychology, psychiatry and sociology. Initially, 236 articles were screened, and finally, 32 articles were evaluated for this review. Results. Emotional expression and expressed emotion were discussed to clarify the distinctions and address overlap between these two similar terms. In addition, expressed emotion was examined further from three different aspects: trait or state, social control and cross-cultural. Finally, the results of reviewed papers for expressed emotion on dementia patients were explored and synthesised. Conclusion. A conceptual definition and a theoretical framework for the concept of expressed emotion are urgently needed to further our understanding of this critical phenomenon.

Eating disorders are still often seen as a women's health issue, and those afflicted remain stigmatized in Western societies. The concept of social distance is a frequently used indicator in awareness campaigns. Sex-specific results could add important information to destigmatization programs. Methods: Data originate from a German telephone survey which was conducted in 2011. Vignettes with signs and symptoms either suggestive of AN or BN were presented to the respondents randomly, who subsequently answered questions regarding beliefs about causes, contact to persons afflicted as well as desire for social distance. Stratified multiple linear regression analyses according to disorder under study were performed to examine associations between different predictors and desire for social distance. Results: There were significant sex differences in desire for social distance, causal attributions, and emotional reactions towards women with eating disorders. E. g., with respect to AN, women exhibited a significantly greater desire for social distance than men (p < .001), and more frequently believed that AN could be caused by sexual abuse during childhood. Regarding predictors of social distance, there was a significant positive association between age and desire for social distance equally among men and women. However, distinct sex differences came into effect concerning other predictors depending on the eating disorder under study. In BN, attribution of brain disease emerged as significant predictor of social distance among men. This is not true for women, where the attribution of weak will significantly predicted the desire for social distance. Conclusion: Sex-dependent differences in attitudes and predictors of social distance towards females afflicted should be met with tailored measures in anti-stigma campaigns, addressing women and men on different levels.

The objectives of the study were to explore the knowledge and attitudes of Pakistani university students toward mental illnesses. People with mental illnesses are challenged not only by their symptoms but also by the prejudices associated with their illness. Acknowledging the stigma of mental illness should be the first essential step toward devising an appropriate treatment plan. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the University of Punjab, Lahore, CMH Lahore Medical and Dental College, Lahore, and University of Sargodha, Sub-campus Lahore, from February to May 2014. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographics, general knowledge of psychiatric illnesses, and Community Attitudes towards Mental Illnesses (CAMI) Scale. The questionnaire was distributed to 650 participants enrolled in different disciplines (Social Sciences, Medicine and Formal Sciences). Results. Response rate was 81\% (527/650 respondents). Mean age was 20.98 years. Most of the students (331, 62.8\%) had an urban background and studied Social Sciences (238, 45.2\%). Four hundred and eighteen respondents (79.3\%) considered religion very important and most respondents considered psychiatrists (334, 63.4\%) and spiritual leaders (72, 13.7\%) to be best able to treat mental illnesses. One hundred and sixty nine respondents (32.1\%) considered black magic to be a cause of mental illness. Only 215 (41\%) respondents had ever read an article on mental illnesses. Multiple regression analysis revealed study discipline, exposure, perceived causes of mental illnesses and superstitions to be significantly associated with attitudes towards mental illnesses (p < .05). Conclusion. Although low awareness and exposure were found in this sample of Pakistani university students, their attitude towards mental illnesses was generally positive. Most respondents gave supernatural explanations for mental illnesses but only a few believed that spiritual leaders can play a role in treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.7717/peerj.698,Social stigma; Attitude; Mental illness; Social psychology; Shame;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,

Participatory research approaches are recommended as an approach to engage minority communities. A key goal of participatory research is to shift the locus of control to community partners. Objective: To understand perceived sources of stress and tools used to promote resiliency in African American men in South Los Angeles. Methods: Our study utilized a community-partnered participatory research approach to collect and analyze open-ended responses from 295 African American men recruited at a local, cultural festival in Los Angeles using thematic analysis and the Levels of Racism framework. Results: Almost all men (93.2\%) reported stress. Of those reporting stress, 60.8\% reported finances and money and 43.2\% reported racism as a specific cause. More than 60\% (63.4\%) reported that they perceived available sources of help to deal with stress. Of those noting a specific source of help for stress (n = 76), 42.1\% identified religious faith. Almost all of participants (92.1\%) mentioned specific sources of resiliency such as religion and family. Conclusions: Stress owing to psychosocial factors such as finances and racism are common among African American men. But, at the same time, most men found support for resiliency to ameliorate stress in religion and family. Future work to engage African American men around alleviating stress and supporting resiliency should both take into account the perceived causes of stress and incorporate culturally appropriate sources of resiliency support.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1353/cpr.2014.0053,Community-based participatory research; men; mental health; health disparities; health promotion; urban population;African Americans,,

These predictions were then applied to lay theories of depression as a specific test case. A systematic literature review on causal beliefs about depression was conducted, including original, quantitative research. Thirty-six studies investigating 13 non-Western and 32 Western cultural groups were analyzed by classifying assumed causes and preferred forms of treatment into common categories. Relations between beliefs and treatment preferences were assessed. Substantial agreement between cultural groups was found with respect to the impact of observable causes. Stress was generally rated as most important. Less agreement resulted for hidden, especially supernatural causes. Causal beliefs were clearly related to treatment preferences in Western groups, while evidence was mostly lacking for non-Western groups.

Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 202 service users with severe mental illnesses were interviewed to assess their reported experiences of discrimination. The Major Experiences of Discrimination Scale assessed major experiences of discrimination and their recency and frequency across 12 life domains and perceived reasons (attributions). The Everyday Experiences of Discrimination Scale assessed ten types of everyday discrimination and attributions for these experiences. Results: Most participants (88\%) reported discrimination in at least one life domain, and 94\% reported ever experiencing everyday discrimination. The most common areas of major discrimination were mental health care (44\%), neighbors (42\%), police (33\%), employment (31\%), and general medical care (31\%). The most common attributions for major discrimination were mental illness (57\%), race-ethnicity (24\%), education or income (20\%), or appearance (19\%).

ResultsMothers typically made attributions that were internal to the child, controllable by the child, personal to the child and stable for the child. Maternal attributions of being able to control the child's behaviour were associated with high maternal criticism and low warmth.

The beliefs of people receiving treatment are researched less often. Method: An online survey on causal beliefs about depression and experiences with antidepressants was completed by 1829 New Zealand adults prescribed anti-depressants in the preceding five years, 974\% of whom proceeded to take antidepressants. Results: The most frequently endorsed of 17 causal beliefs were family stress, relationship problems, loss of loved one, financial problems, isolation, and abuse or neglect in childhood. Factor analysis produced three factors: `bio-genetic' `adulthood stress and `childhood adversity'. The most strongly endorsed explanations for increases in antidepressant prescribing invoked improved identification, reduced stigma and drug company marketing. The least strongly endorsed was `Anti-depressants are the best treatment'. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported efficacy of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs, negatively associated with childhood adversity beliefs and unrelated to adulthood stress beliefs. The belief that `People cannot' get better by themselves even if they try' was positively associated with bio-genetic beliefs. Limitations: The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bio-genetic explanations, since 83\% reported that the medication reduced their depression. Conclusions: Clinicians' should consider exploring patients' causal beliefs. The public, even when taking antidepressants, continues to hold a multi factorial causal model of depression with a primary emphasis on psycho social causes. A three factor model of those beliefs may lead to more sophisticated understandings of relationships with stigma variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier By.

It has been argued that in particular believing in a `chemical imbalance' as a cause of mental disorder might be associated with more tolerant attitudes. Method: In a representative population survey in Germany (n=3642), using unlabelled case vignettes of persons with depression, schizophrenia, or alcohol dependence, we elicited agreement with three different biogenetic explanations of the illness: `Chemical imbalance of the brain', `brain disease' and `heredity'. We further investigated emotional reactions as well as the desire for social distance. For each vignette condition we calculated linear regressions with each biogenetic explanation as independent and emotional reactions as well as social distance as dependent variable controlling for socio-clemographic variables. Limitations: Our cross-sectional study does not allow statements regarding causality and the explanatory power of our statistical models was low. Results: `Chemical imbalance of the brain' and `brain disease' were both associated with a stronger desire for social distance in schizophrenia and depression, and with more social acceptance in alcohol dependence, whereas `heredity' was not significantly associated with social distance in any of the investigated illnesses. All three biogenetic causal beliefs were associated with more fear in all three illnesses. Conclusion: Our study corroborates findings that biogenetic explanations have different effects in different disorders, and seem to be harmful in depression and schizophrenia.

Methods: Analyses are based on a telephone survey in two large German cities (Hamburg and Munich, N = 2,014, response rate 51\%). Vignettes with typical signs and symptoms suggestive of depression and schizophrenia were presented. Respondents were asked about beliefs about causes of the mental disorders, their emotional reactions and their desire for social distance. Results: Lower education is significantly associated with a stronger tendency for social distance in the case of depression but not in case of schizophrenia, when age and gender are controlled.

Methods: In 2011, telephone interviews were carried out with 6019 Australians aged 15 or over. Participants were presented with a case vignette describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia, chronic schizophrenia, social phobia or PTSD. Participants were asked about their beliefs about the causes of these disorders and about their personally held stigmatising attitudes, stigmatising attitudes perceived in others and the desire for social distance from the person described in the vignette. Results: Belief in a weak or nervous personality as the cause of mental disorders was most consistently associated with personal stigma, perceived stigma and desire for social distance across vignettes. Belief in biogenetic causes was associated with a decreased belief in mental disorders as due to weakness rather than sickness, but was not linked to either a decreased or increased belief in dangerousness and unpredictability or desire for social distance. Belief in physical causes was associated with an increased belief in mental disorders as due to weakness rather than sickness. Belief in psychosocial causes had no consistent associations with stigma. Conclusions: Explaining mental disorders as due to personality characteristics is a more important factor in stigma than either biogenetic or psychosocial explanations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0004867414528054,Stigma; mental disorders; causal beliefs;Mental Disorders,,

To this end, an Implicit Association Test (IAT) assessing the association between the Mental Illness and Physical Illness target categories to the Psychological and Biologic attribute categories, representative of the causal explanation domains, was developed. The IAT presented 22 stimuli (words and pictures) to be categorized into the four categories. After 360 university students completed the IAT, a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement (MFRM) modelling approach was applied. The model specified a person latency parameter and a stimulus latency parameter. Two additional parameters were introduced to denote the order of presentation of the task associative conditions and the general response accuracy. Beyond the overall definition of the latent measurement dimension, the MFRM was also applied to disentangle the effect of the task block order and the general response accuracy on the stimuli response latency. Further, the MFRM allowed detecting any differential functioning of each stimulus in relation to both block ordering and accuracy. The results evidenced: a) the existence of a latency measurement dimension underlying the Mental Illness versus Physical Illness - Implicit Association Test; b) significant effects of block order and accuracy on the overall latency; c) a differential functioning of specific stimuli. The results of the present study can contribute to a better understanding of the functioning of an implicit measure of semantic associations with mental illness and give a first blueprint for the examination of relevant issues in the development of an IAT.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0101911,Reaction Time,,

Objective: To describe the explanatory models (EMs) of depression in South Asia with the goal of informing the content of culturally appropriate PTs for this region. Methods: Two methods were used: a systematic review of published literature on the EMs of depression in South Asia; and in-depth interviews with persons with depression and family caregivers in two sites in India. Findings from both were analysed independently and then triangulated. Results: There were 19 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Interviews were conducted with 27 patients and 10 caregivers. Findings were grouped under four broad categories: illness descriptions, perceived impact, causal beliefs and self-help forms of coping. Depression was characterised predominantly by somatic complaints, stress, low mood, and negative and ruminative thoughts. Patients experienced disturbances in interpersonal relationships occupational functioning, and stigma. Negative life events, particularly relationship difficulties, were perceived as the main cause. Patients mostly engaged in distracting activities, religious practices, and received support from family and friends to cope with the illness. Limitations: The primary data are entirely from India but the studies from the literature review covering South Asia are consistent with these findings. This study also does not include literature in local languages or explore how consumer perspectives change over time. Conclusions: EMs can inform cultural adaptations to PTs for depression in South Asia by defining target outcomes, content for psycho-education, and culturally appropriate treatment strategies.

Sexual dysfunction, common in general medical practice, is under-recognized and inadequately managed resulting in significant morbidity and reduction in quality of life. We examined the nature, prevalence, clinical features and explanatory models of illness among men with sexual dysfunction in a general healthcare setting. Methods. We recruited 270 consecutive men attending a general health clinic. Participants were evaluated using a structured interview. The International Index of Erectile Function-5, the Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation-5, Short Explanatory Model Interview and the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule were used to assess sexual dysfunction, explanatory models and psychiatric morbidity. Results. Premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction were reported by 43.0\% and 47.8\% of men, respectively. The most common perceived causes were loss of semen due to masturbation and nocturnal emission. Popular treatments were herbal remedies and resources used were traditional healers. The factors associated with erectile dysfunction were diabetes mellitus, financial stress, past history of psychiatric treatment and common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety; those associated with premature ejaculation were common mental disorders, older age and financial debt. Sexual dysfunctions and concerns were under-diagnosed by physicians when compared to the research interview. Conclusion. There is a need to recognize sexual problems and effectively manage them in general medical settings. The need for sex education in schools and through the mass media, to remove sexual misconceptions, cannot be under-emphasized.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",,Prevalence;India,,

However, genetic contingency theory predicts that genetic attributions will lead to an increased desire for social distance only from persons with disorders who are perceived as dangerous. To assess the interactive effect of diagnosis and attribution on social distance and actual helping decisions across disorders. Undergraduate students (n = 149) were randomly assigned to read one of the six vignettes depicting a person affected by one of the three disorders (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression) with either a genetic or environmental causal attribution for disorder. Participants completed measures of perceived dangerousness, social distance, empathic concern, familiarity with mental illness, and actual helping decisions. When provided with genetic attributions, participants' desire for social distance was greater for targets with schizophrenia relative to targets with depression or bipolar disorder. This effect was mediated by perceived dangerousness. The indirect effect of diagnosis on helping decisions, through social distance, was significant within the genetic attribution condition. Consistent with genetic contingency theory, genetic attributions for schizophrenia, but not affective disorders, lead to greater desire for social distance via greater perceived dangerousness. Further, results suggest that genetic attributions decrease the likelihood of helping people with schizophrenia, but have no effect on the likelihood of helping people with affective disorders.

Ninety-seven participants were given vignettes of characters describing symptoms of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress. They were required to identify psychological symptoms as disorders, rate beliefs about the causes of and helpful treatments for these disorders, and rate attitude statements regarding the two characters. Australian participants recognized the presented symptoms as specific mental disorders significantly more than Iraqi and Sudanese participants did, and reported causal and treatment beliefs which were more congruent with expert beliefs as per the western medical model of mental disorder. The Sudanese group endorsed supernatural and religious causal beliefs regarding depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms most often; but both Sudanese and Iraqi participants strongly supported options from the supernatural and religious treatment items. However, evidence for pluralistic belief systems was also found. Although sampling was non-random, suggesting caution in the interpretation of results, it appears that the mental health literacy of lay Australians may be more aligned with the western medical model of mental disorder than that of Iraqi and Sudanese refugee communities.

However, no studies have addressed how fatigue is understood by paramedics. The present study addresses this shortcoming by exploring factors paramedics recognise as contributors to fatigue. Methods Forty-nine (12F; 38 years +/- 9.7 years) Australian paramedics completed a survey on perceived causes of performance impairing fatigue. A total of 107 responses were systematically coded following principles common to qualitative data analysis: data immersion, coding, categorisation and theme generation. Results Six themes emerged: working time, sleep, workload, health and well-being, work-life balance and environment. Consistent with a scientific understanding of fatigue, prior sleep and wake, time of day and task-related factors were often identified as contributing to fatigue. In other cases, paramedics' attributions deviated from a scientific understanding of direct causes of fatigue. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that paramedics have a broad understanding of fatigue. It is critical to take this into account when discussing fatigue with paramedics, particularly in the case of fatigue education or wellness programmes.

In contrast, psychosocial explanations attenuate prognostic pessimism and perceived otherness, but seem less suitable to reduce blame. We hypothesized that a vulnerability-stress model that combines biogenetic and psychosocial explanations would yield clearer stigma-reducing effects than the mono-causal models. In an online-experiment, 416 participants from the general population randomly received either a vulnerability-stress, biogenetic, psychosocial or control-intervention, which consisted of information text and video presentation of a case-example. Causal beliefs, stereotypes and desired social distance were assessed by self-report. Baseline causal beliefs were weakly associated with stereotypes. The vulnerability-stress intervention did not reduce stigma more effectively than the biogenetic or psychosocial intervention and was less effective in reducing perceived blame than the biogenetic intervention.

This requires an understanding of how distress is experienced. We conducted a qualitative grounded theory study to understand how mothers experience and manage distress in Dhanusha, a low-resource setting in rural Nepal. We also explored how distressed mothers interact with their families and the wider community. Methods: Participants were identified during a cluster-randomised controlled trial in which mothers were screened for psychological distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with distressed mothers (GHQ-12 score >= 5) and one with a traditional healer (dhami), as well as 12 focus group discussions with community members. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods and a model was developed to explain psychological distress in this setting. Results: We found that distress was termed tension by participants and mainly described in terms of physical symptoms. Key perceived causes of distress were poor health, lack of sons, and fertility problems. Tension developed in a context of limited autonomy for women and perceived duty towards the family. Distressed mothers discussed several strategies to alleviate tension, including seeking treatment for perceived physical health problems and tension from doctors or dhamis, having repeated pregnancies until a son was delivered, manipulating social circumstances in the household, and deciding to accept their fate. Their ability to implement these strategies depended on whether they were able to negotiate with their in-laws or husbands for resources. Conclusions: Vulnerability, as a consequence of gender and social disadvantage, manifests as psychological distress among mothers in Dhanusha. Screening tools incorporating physical symptoms of tension should be envisaged, along with interventions to address gender inequity, support marital relationships, and improve access to perinatal healthcare.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/1471-244X-14-60,Nepal; South Asia; Psychological distress; Postnatal depression; Perinatal common mental disorders; Maternal mental health; Rural health;Nepal,,

Family impact, psychological distress, and coping strategies were assessed using validated psychological questionnaires including Family Impact Scale, General Health Questionnaire, and Coping Response Inventory. Findings revealed that mothers relied more on the use of approach-oriented rather than avoidance-oriented coping strategies. According to General Health Questionnaire scores, 38.2\% of mothers showed some evidence of psychological distress, and 23.6\% were suspected of having severe psychological problems. Regarding the family impact of CLP, mothers reported the greatest impact to be on the family's financial status and parental emotions.

Based on a randomized household sample of 941 Chinese community adults in Hong Kong, results of the structural equation modeling demonstrated that people who endorsed cultural lay beliefs tended to perceive the course of mental illness as less controllable, whereas those with psychosocial attributions see its course as more controllable. The more people perceived the course of mental illness as less controllable, more chronic, and incomprehensible, the lower was their acceptance and the greater was mental illness stigma. Furthermore, those who perceived mental illness with dire consequences were more likely to feel greater stigma and social distance. Conversely, when people were more accepting, they were more likely to seek help for psychological services and felt a shorter social distance.

Discrimination (33 2\%), acceptance or rejection by others (21.4\%), and loneliness (24.9\%) were the most common reasons given for greater susceptibility among gay men, yet men with MDD reported problems with love/relationship (32.5\%,) and work (28.9\%) as the most common perceived causes of recent depression, and problems with love/relationship (21.9\%), accepting one's homosexuality (21.1\%), and family (20.2\%) at initial outset. The highest proportions of gay men rated non-medical options such as a close friend (91.6\%), relaxation exercises or meditation (84.4\%), and physical activity (83.5\%) as being helpful for the depression vignette. Limitations: No probes used for open questions, and findings generalizable only to gay men in the sampling scheme. Conclusions: There are many commonalities in labelling, perceived causes, and help-seeking with general populations, but also numerous specificities in mental health literacy and experience among gay men.

However, the associations are complex and heterogeneous. The effects of antistigma campaigns that have implemented personal contact have been limited and interventions promoting biological causal explanations have been found to increase stigmatization in some cases. Possibly a more suitable strategy for antistigma interventions could be to incorporate continuum beliefs, which propose that symptoms of schizophrenia lie on a continuum with normal experiences. The present study considers the potential for interventions focused on continuum beliefs by investigating the association between continuum beliefs and stigmatization. Within a sample of 120 participants of an online study, higher levels of continuum beliefs (assessed with the Continuum Beliefs Questionnaire, CBQ) were significantly correlated with lower stereotype scores. This association remained significant after controlling for known correlates of stereotypes (contact, causal beliefs, and educational level). We did not find an association between continuum beliefs and social distance. It is concluded that the promotion of continuum beliefs should be considered in the development of new antistigma campaigns.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1080/17522439.2012.740068,continuum beliefs; schizophrenia; stigma; social distance; stereotypes;Schizophrenia;Stereotyping,,

Several theoretical models have been proposed to predict the relationship between causal beliefs and social acceptance. This study uses path models to compare different theoretical predictions regarding attitudes towards persons with schizophrenia, depression and alcohol dependence. Method In a representative population survey in Germany (n=3642), we elicited agreement with belief in biogenetic causes, current stress and childhood adversities as causes of either disorder as described in an unlabelled case vignette. We further elicited potentially mediating attitudes related to different theories about the consequences of biogenetic causal beliefs (attribution theory: onset responsibility, offset responsibility; genetic essentialism: differentness, dangerousness; genetic optimism: treatability) and social acceptance. For each vignette condition, we calculated a multiple mediator path model containing all variables. Results Biogenetic beliefs were associated with lower social acceptance in schizophrenia and depression, and with higher acceptance in alcohol dependence. In schizophrenia and depression, perceived differentness and dangerousness mediated the largest indirect effects, the consequences of biogenetic causal explanations thus being in accordance with the predictions of genetic essentialism. Psychosocial causal beliefs had differential effects: belief in current stress as a cause was associated with higher acceptance in schizophrenia, while belief in childhood adversities resulted in lower acceptance of a person with depression. Conclusions Biological causal explanations seem beneficial in alcohol dependence, but harmful in schizophrenia and depression. The negative correlates of believing in childhood adversities as a cause of depression merit further exploration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1017/S003329171300072X,stigma; genetic essentialism; public attitudes; Attribution theory; population survey,,

The aim of this study was to measure public stigma against PWMI and the factors associated with stigma in the Gilgel Gibe Field Research Center (GGFRC) in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: This community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2012 among 845 randomly selected respondents by using the Community Attitudes towards the Mentally III (CAMI) scale, an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data was entered with EPI-DATA and then exported to STATA for analysis. Simple descriptive and linear regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of stigma against PWMI. Results: Of the total of 845 respondents, 68.17\% were from rural districts. The mean stigma score was 2.62 on a 5-point score. The majority of the respondents (75.27\%) believed that mental illness can be cured. Stress, poverty, and rumination were the most often perceived causes of mental illness. Rural residents had significantly higher stigma scores (std. beta = 0.61, P<0.001). A statistically significant inverse relationship was found between the level of education and degree of stigma (std. beta = -0.14, P<0.01), while higher income was significantly associated with more stigma (std. beta = 0.07, P<0.05). Respondents with higher scores for perceived supernatural causes (std. beta = -0.09, P<0.01) and perceived psychosocial and biological causes (std. beta = -0.14, P< 0.001) had significantly lower stigma levels. Conclusions: The study found a more undermining but less avoidant attitude towards PWMI. Rural residents showed higher levels of stigma. Stigma against PWMI was lower in people with an explanatory concept about the causes of mental illness and a higher level of education. Information, education, and communication about the causes, signs, and nature of mental illnesses would help to reduce stigma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0082116,Mentally Ill Persons,,

They rated their agreement with 22 causal items as possible causes for the difficulties depicted in the vignette, the perceived helpfulness of 22 interventions, and four social distance items using a 7-point Likert scale. Only 8\% of Kuwait students, yet 33\% of UK students identified possible intellectual disability in the vignette. Medium to large differences between the two samples were observed on seven of the causal items, and 10 of the intervention items. Against predictions, social distance did not differ. Causal beliefs mediated the relationship between recognition of intellectual disability and social distance, but their mediating role differed by sample. The findings are discussed in relation to cultural practices and values, and in relation to attribution theory. In view of the apparent positive effect of awareness of the symptoms of intellectual disability on social distance, both directly and through the mediating effects of causal beliefs, promoting increased awareness of intellectual disability and inclusive practices should be a priority, particularly in countries such as Kuwait where it appears to be low.

Help seeking refers to open-ended help-seeking suggestions (general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist, family, friends, and self-care options). Stigma refers to social exclusion after treatment. The data are analyzed by means of logistic and linear regression models in SPSS Statistics 19. People who adhere to the biopsychosocial (versus psychosocial) model are more likely to recommend general medical care and people who apply the disease view are more likely to recommend specialized medical care. Regarding informal help, those who prefer the biopsychosocial model are less likely to recommend consulting friends than those who adhere to the psychosocial model. Respondents who apply a medical compared to a non-medical label are less inclined to recommend self-care. As concerns treatment stigma, respondents who apply a medical instead of a non-medical label are more likely to socially exclude someone who has been in psychiatric treatment.

The current study aimed to investigate the current prevalence of causal beliefs about depression in the Australian public, the factors associated with these beliefs, and changes over time. Method: A nationally representative sample of Australian adults was surveyed as part of the 2011 National Mental Health Literacy and Stigma Survey. Beliefs about the causes of depression were assessed based on responses to vignettes depicting a person with either depression (n=893) or depression with suicidal thoughts (n=903). Socio-demographic characteristics, personal and professional experience with depression, and correct recognition of depression were investigated as predictors of causal beliefs about depression using binary logistic regression. Comparisons were made between the Australian publics current causal beliefs and data obtained in national surveys conducted in 1995 and 2003/4. Results: Over 80\% of the Australian public attributed depression to clay to day problems, death of a close friend or relative, a recent traumatic event, childhood problems, and a chemical imbalance in the brain. People who correctly labelled the disorder in the vignettes were more likely to attribute depression to psychosocial reasons and less likely to attribute it to an allergic reaction, a virus, or an infection. Belief in psychosocial and genetic causes has increased over time, whereas belief in infection, allergy and weakness of character has decreased. Limitations: Comparisons between the 1995, 2003/4 and 2011 surveys were limited by the differences in the survey methodology at each time point, and by low response rates to the 2003/4 and 2011 surveys. The survey design prevented insight into the reasoning underlying individuals' responses, and lacked sufficient power to explore the beliefs of Australians from cultural minorities.

The present study investigated how risk factors for a weight gain of at least 10\% (major weight gain) and mental health modify their mutual association during a 6-year prospective follow-up of depressed outpatients. Method: The study sample consisted of 121 depressed treatment-seeking outpatients with a mean age of 44.9 years. A 6-year follow-up started in January 1996. At baseline and on follow-up after 2 and 6 years, psychiatric diagnoses were obtained using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-I), while cluster C personality disorders (PD) were assessed on 6-month follow-up (SCID-II). Depression was also assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and general psychopathology with the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) at baseline and at the end of the 6-year follow-up. Weight changes were based on measurements at baseline and at the end of the follow-up. Logistic regression was used to study the factors associated with major weight gain (>= 10\%). Results: Altogether, 16\% of the study sample experienced major weight gain during the 6-year follow-up. Adverse childhood/adolescent experiences as a self-perceived cause of depression (OR 3.72, 95\% CI 1.06-13.1, p = 0.040), higher scores in the HAM-D (OR 1.11, 95\% CI 1.02-1.22, p = 0.019) and the SCL-90 subscale of anxiety (OR 2.22, 95\% CI 1.11-4.42, p = 0.023) at baseline, and cluster C PD at 6 months (OR 3.16, 95\% CI 1.11-8.97, p = 0.031) were separately associated with major weight gain after adjusting for age, gender, and baseline body mass index (BMI). Conclusion: The severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and linking adverse childhood with depression at the beginning of treatment, as well as cluster C PD at 6 months, were predictors of major weight gain.

Storylines, however, are a promising strategy to understanding mental health problems that is sensitive to the experiences and situations of people, and can bring into view more relevant details of patients' lives. This paper provides a theoretically grounded justification for the use of storylines in both mental health practice and research. Storylines are defined, while suggestions are provided for how this framework might be put into practice.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between depression-related attribution styles and perceived pain intensity (PPI) after controllable versus uncontrollable electrical skin stimulation in healthy male individuals. METHODS: Causal attributions for negative events were measured using the attribution style questionnaire (ASQ) on the dimensions internal versus external (INT), global versus specific (GLO) and stable versus unstable (STA) in 50 men (20 to 31 years of age). Additionally, symptoms of anxiety and depression (measured using the Depression Scale) as well as baseline helplessness were assessed. Participants were randomly assigned to receive self-administered (controllable) or experimenter-administered (uncontrollable) painful skin stimuli. PPI was assessed after stress exposure using a visual analogue scale (0 to 100). Relationships between PPI and depression-related cognitions were calculated using correlation and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Correlation analyses revealed a moderate correlation between PPI and ASQ-INT scores (r=0.46). Following uncontrollable stress exposure, significantly higher PPI ratings (P=0.001) and a higher correlation between PPI and ASQ-INT (r=0.70) were observed. Multiple regression analysis showed an independent influence of stressor controllability (beta=0.39; P=0.003) and ASQ-INT (beta=0.36; P=0.006) on PPI. Discussion: These findings highlight the interaction of specific depression-related cognitions and stress controllability on pain intensity perception.

They likely influence the family's help-seeking decisions and affect both adherence with biomedical interventions and social integration of the patients. The aim of this study was to describe Tunisian families' beliefs about the causes, the symptoms and the treatments of schizophrenia. Methods. - We led a transversal study including 91 relatives of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV). We excluded patients with mental retardation or neurological diseases. For family members, we excluded participants with a history of mental disorders or cognitive impairments. We collected basic socio-demographic data for both patients and relatives. We asked relatives to respond by ``yes/no/I am not certain{''} to a three-part questionnaire including 27 items dealing with causal explanations, symptoms and optimal cures for schizophrenia. Results. - The mean age of the relatives was 49.8 (+/- 13.7) years; 54.9\% were men; 49.4\% were parents, 8.8\% spouses, 39.6\% brothers or sisters; 25.3\% had not attended school, 24.2\% had attended primary school, 37.4\% junior high school or high school and 13.2\% had a university degree; 63.7\% lived in an urban area; 33\% had low economic status and 41.8\% reported having another family member with mental disorder. Only 46.2\% of participants had asked psychiatrists about the diagnosis of their sick relatives and only 16.5\% were able to label the term ``schizophrenia{''}. Among the cited etiologies of schizophrenia, religious causes were found in 76.9\% of cases, they first cited God's will or fate and secondly God's punishment. Magical explanations such as witchcraft and possession by ``djinns{''} were found in 47.3\% of cases. The biological causes were cited by 59.3\% of participants. The majority of participants (95.6\%) proved the need for drugs and 81.3\% the utility of psychotherapies. However, 30.8\% believed in non-medical practices such as reading Holy Koran verses, charity and exorcism. Significant correlations were found between relatives' low level of education, low economic status, living in a rural area and supernatural beliefs, traditional practices, stigma and the use of the term `madness'. Significant correlations were also found between family history of mental disorders and beliefs on family and hereditary causes. Conclusion. - In this study, opinions and attitudes regarding schizophrenia were related to education level, economic status and geographic origin. Few persons recognized the term ``schizophrenia{''} despite a long contact with the mental health system. This fact points out the need to improve the psychoeducation of family members of persons with schizophrenia.

This research examined for the first time whether people with depressive symptoms would associate biological accounts of depression with pessimism about their own prognoses and whether a psychoeducation intervention portraying the biology of depression as malleable could decrease prognostic pessimism among symptomatic individuals. Method: In 3 studies, participants were recruited online and assessed for depression symptoms. Those with significant depressive symptomatology (a Beck Depression Inventory-II score of at least 16) rated their endorsement of biochemical and genetic causal attributions for their symptoms and indicated expected length of symptom duration. An audiovisual intervention emphasizing the malleability of gene effects and neurochemistry was developed, and its effects on symptomatic individuals' prognostic pessimism, feelings of agency, guilt, and general hopelessness were measured. Results: Biochemical and genetic causal attributions for depression were significantly associated with prognostic pessimism among symptomatic individuals. The malleability intervention significantly reduced prognostic pessimism, increased feelings of agency, and decreased general hopelessness. Conclusions: Biochemical and genetic attributions for depression are related to prognostic pessimism among individuals with depressive symptoms, and not just among the general public.

A survey was carried out to collect beliefs on and attitudes toward depression in Italy, which has an established community-based mental health system. Methods: A telephone survey was carried out in a probabilistic sample aged >= 15 years. A 20-item questionnaire was administered to explore knowledge of depression, stigma, causal beliefs, treatment preference, and help-seeking attitudes. Results: Of the 1001 participants, 98\% were aware of depression, and 62\% had experienced it, either directly or indirectly. A widespread belief (75\%) was that people suffering from depression should avoid talking about their problem. A minority of the sample viewed depression as a condition that should be managed without recourse to external help or a ``socially dangerous'' illness. Among perceived causes of depression, most respondents mentioned life stressors or physical strains. Psychologists were often indicated as an adequate source of professional help. Half of the sample believed that depression should be pharmacologically treated, but drugs were often seen as addictive. Referring to a primary care physician (PCP) was considered embarrassing; furthermore, many people thought that PCPs are too busy to treat patients suffering from depression. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that depression is seen as a reaction to significant life events that should be overcome with the support of significant others or the help of health professionals (mainly psychologists). However, there are still barriers to the disclosure of depressive symptoms to PCPs, and concerns about the addictive effect of antidepressants. In the presence of a gap between people's beliefs and what health professionals consider appropriate for the treatment of depression, a ``shared decision making'' approach to treatment selection should be adopted taking into account the patients' preference for psychological interventions to ensure active compliance with effective treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0063806,Italy,,

Persisting gaps in the primary care of depression are due in part to patients' reluctance to bring depressive symptoms to the attention of their primary care clinician and, when depression is diagnosed, to accept initial treatment for the condition. Both targeted and tailored communication strategies offer promise for fomenting discussion and reducing barriers to appropriate initial treatment of depression. Methods/design: The Activating Messages to Enhance Primary Care Practice (AMEP2) Study is a stratified randomized controlled trial comparing two computerized multimedia patient interventions - one targeted (to patient gender and income level) and one tailored (to level of depressive symptoms, visit agenda, treatment preferences, depression causal attributions, communication self-efficacy and stigma)-and an attention control. AMEP2 consists of two linked sub-studies, one focusing on patients with significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 {[}PHQ-9] scores >= 5), the other on patients with few or no depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 5). The first sub-study examined effectiveness of the interventions; key outcomes included delivery of components of initial depression care (antidepressant prescription or mental health referral). The second sub-study tracked potential hazards (clinical distraction and overtreatment). A telephone interview screening procedure assessed patients for eligibility and oversampled patients with significant depressive symptoms. Sampled, consenting patients used computers to answer survey questions, be randomized, and view assigned interventions just before scheduled primary care office visits. Patient surveys were also collected immediately post-visit and 12 weeks later. Physicians completed brief reporting forms after each patient's index visit. Additional data were obtained from medical record abstraction and visit audio recordings. Of 6,191 patients assessed, 867 were randomized and included in analysis, with 559 in the first sub-study and 308 in the second. Discussion: Based on formative research, we developed two novel multimedia programs for encouraging patients to discuss depressive symptoms with their primary care clinicians. Our computer-based enrollment and randomization procedures ensured that randomization was fully concealed and data missingness minimized.

Multiple methods are needed to address the many different components or dimensions of cultural identity and experience that constitute local worlds, ways of life or systems of knowledge. Quantitative and observational methods of clinical epidemiology and experimental science as well as qualitative ethnographic methods are needed to capture crucial aspects of culture as systems of meaning and practice. Emerging issues in cultural psychiatric research include: cultural variations in illness experience and expression; the situated nature of cognition and emotion; cultural configurations of self and personhood; concepts of mental disorder and mental health literacy; and the prospect of ecosocial models of health and culturally based interventions.

Furthermore, reported explanations of suicide are shaped not only by events but also the relationship of survivor respondents explaining the suicide. An explanatory model interview for sociocultural autopsy has been used to assess underlying problems and perceived causes. This study in a low-income community of Mumbai in 2003-2004 compared accounts of the closest family survivors and more distant relationships. Our study design distinguished series-level agreement (i.e., consistency of accounts within a group) and case-level agreement for particular cases. Serious mental illness was the perceived cause reported by a respondent in either group for 22.0\% of index suicides, but case-level agreement was only 6.0\%. Regarding financial stressors, more closely related family respondents focused on acute stressors instead of enduring effects of poverty. Case-level agreement was high for marital problems, but low for other sources of family conflict. Tension was a feature of suicide reported in both groups, but case-level agreement on tension as a perceived cause was low (kappa = 0.14). The role of alcohol as a perceived cause of suicide had high series level agreement (46.0\% in both groups) and case-level agreement (kappa = 0.60), suggesting comparable community and professional views of its significance. The study shows that it is relevant and feasible to consider general community patterns and particular survivor interests. Findings from this study recommend an approach to sociocultural autopsy to assess reasons for suicide in community studies. Findings clarify diverse views of underlying problems motivating suicide that should be considered to make mental health care more effective in assessing risk and preventing suicide.

As data from Europe is scarce, medical students' attitudes were investigated at the University of Leipzig in Leipzig, Germany. Design: Cross-sectional survey containing an experimental manipulation consisting of a pair of vignettes depicting an obese and a normal weight 42-year-old woman, respectively. Vignettes were followed by the Fat Phobia Scale (FPS), a semantic differential assessing weight related attitudes. In case of the overweight vignette a panel of questions on causal attribution for the overweight preceded administration of the FPS. Subjects: 671 medical students were enrolled at the University of Leipzig from May to June 2011. Results: The overweight vignette was rated significantly more negative than the normal weight vignette (mean FPS score 3.65 +/- 0.45 versus 2.54 +/- 0.38, p<0.001). A higher proportion of students had negative attitudes towards the overweight as compared to the normal weight individual (98.9\% versus 53.7\%, p<0.001). A ``positive energy balance{''} was perceived as the most relevant cause for the overweight, followed by ``negligent personality trait{''}, ``societal and social environment{''} and ``biomedical causes{''}. Attributing a ``positive energy balance{''} or ``negligent personality trait{''} as relevant cause for the overweight was positively associated with negative attitudes. Conclusion: The results of this study confirm and complement findings from other countries, mainly the USA, and indicate that weight bias in the health care setting may be a global issue. Stigmatizing attitudes towards overweight and obesity are prevalent among a sample of medical students at the University of Leipzig. Negative attitudes arise on the basis of holding the individual accountable for the excess weight. They call for bringing the topic of overweight and obesity more into the focus of the medical curriculum and for enhancing medical students' awareness of the complex aetiology of this health condition.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0048113,"Students, Medical",,

However, few investigations have sought to identify the mechanisms by which such explanations are associated with greater posttraumatic distress. One possible factor that may account for the relationship between maladaptive attributional tendencies and PTSD symptoms is the quality of social reactions received from one's social network upon disclosure. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between self-blaming attributions provided for traumatic events, negative social reactions, and PTSD symptom severity. Undergraduate psychology students (N = 68), who reported previously experiencing interpersonal assault, completed measures assessing their attributions for their assault and the quality of reactions received from members of their social network upon disclosure. Results from a statistical mediational analysis suggest that a self-blame may be associated with poorer psychological adjustment by virtue of negative social reactions. Results of this study further our understanding of risk and resilience among assault survivors and may have significant implications for treatment interventions for individuals with PTSD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1177/0886260512445379,PTSD; attributions; social reactions; interpersonal assault;Self Disclosure;Disclosure,,

Significant effects were also observed with functional impairment, though to a lesser degree. Coping by avoidance and social isolation predicted more severe mental health outcomes. Spirituality and positive reappraisal predicted greater psychological adaptation than did social support seeking. Despite advancements in anti-retroviral treatment for women, HIV/AIDS symptoms and acute and/or chronic psychosocial stress pose the same threat to behavioral and mental health.

Furthermore, factors influencing stigmatization were identified. Methods: A survey consisting of questions regarding social distance, cognitive attitude components, stereotypical beliefs and behavioural tendencies towards pharmaceutical care for patients with depression was carried out. The survey was completed by 149 community pharmacists with a response rate of 82\%. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to the results of the survey. Results: Most pharmacists endorsed social distance towards patients with depression. The social distance further increased the more the situation described implied ``social closeness{''}. Age, depression care attitude, the stereotypical belief ``danger to others{''} and the level of involvement pharmacists showed towards patients with depression were found to predict social distance. The present model explains 32.3\% of the variance in social distance. Conclusion: The results showed that community pharmacists have a stigmatizing attitude towards patients with depression.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a detailed description of factors that contribute to patient default and solutions from the point of view of health care professionals who participate in TB care. DESIGN: In-depth interviews were conducted with 62 physicians and nurses at nine regional public pulmonary clinics and local health clinics. RESULTS: Participants had a median of 24 years of experience in health care. Treatment default was seen as a result of multilevel factors related to the patient (lack of means, being a migrant worker, distance to treatment site, poor understanding of treatment, drug use, mental illness), medical team (high patient load, low motivation, lack of resources for tracking defaulters), treatment organization (poor communication between treatment sites, no systematic strategy for patient education or tracking, incomplete record keeping), and health care system and society. Tailored recommendations for low- and higher-cost interventions are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to enhance TB treatment completion should take into account the local context and multilevel factors that contribute to default.

The current study describes common caregiver causal attributions about psychosis onset in youth, including a subset of first-episode psychosis patients, and the patient and caregiver characteristics that influence these attributions. It also examines if caregiver views are affected by contact with youth mental health services. Methods: Fifty-one caregivers of 50 youth patients with a diagnosed Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) psychotic disorder were interviewed about their causal attributions. Patient and caregiver demographic and clinical predictors were also collected. Results: Caregivers most highly endorsed substance use, genetics, negative peer influences and school stress as individual causes. These findings were consistent across the total sample. Principal components analysis derived three causal categories. Caregivers most frequently endorsed a biological and substance use lifestyle causal category, followed by psychological vulnerability and stress-reactivity causal categories. There was evidence that caregiver and patient factors, as well as contact with youth mental health services, influenced the causal attributions caregivers made about the onset of psychosis. Conclusion: Caregivers of youth with psychosis are making causal attributions that are consistent with current aetiological theories of psychosis in youth. The study showed that caregivers are particularly cognizant of genetic and substance use factors in the development and maintenance of psychosis. However, youth mental health services may need to particularly focus on increasing caregiver understanding of the dynamics of stress factors as symptoms, and not causes, of psychosis early in the illness course.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1111/j.1751-7893.2011.00335.x,aetiology; caregiver; mental health service; psychotic disorder; youth;Adolescent;Psychotic Disorders;Caregivers;Causality,,

There is a seemingly dichotomous belief regarding what causes severe mental disturbance: people living in western countries tend to focus mainly on biological and psychosocial risk factors; whereas, in non-western countries the focus is mainly on supernatural and religious factors. These belief systems about causation potentially dictate the type of intervention preferred. Studying such belief systems in any society is expected to help in planning and implementation of appropriate mental health services. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted among the Borana semi-nomadic population in southern Ethiopia to explore perceived causes of severe mental disturbance and preferred interventions. We selected, using purposive sampling, key informants from three villages and conducted a total of six focus group discussions: three for males and three for females. Results: The views expressed regarding the causes of mental disturbance were heterogeneous encompassing supernatural causes such as possession by evil spirits, curse, bewitchment, `exposure to wind' and subsequent attack by evil spirit in postnatal women and biopsychosocial causes such as infections (malaria), loss, `thinking too much', and alcohol and khat abuse. The preferred interventions for severe mental disturbance included mainly indigenous approaches, such as consulting Borana wise men or indigenous healers, prayer, holy water treatment and seeking modern mental health care as a last resort. Conclusions: These findings will be of value for health care planners who wish to expand modern mental health care to this population, indicating the need to increase awareness about the causes of severe mental disturbance and their interventions and collaborate with influential people and indigenous healers to increase acceptability of modern mental health care. It also provides information for further research in the area of mental health in this semi-nomadic population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/1471-244X-12-79,"",,

Results: The TBI Clinical Reminder Screen has generally good sensitivity (.87-.90) but poor specificity (.13-.18). In addition, the TBI Clinical Reminder Screen, when compared with the Comprehensive TBI Evaluation by a clinician, has generally poor negative predictive power (.31-.49) in this sample.

To describe illness representations in a population with advanced disease receiving palliative care and to examine the relationship between illness perceptions, adaptive coping, and depression. Methods. A cross-sectional survey of 301 consecutive eligible patients recruited from a palliative care service in south London, U. K. Measures used included the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief IPQ), the Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) Scale, and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Results. Scores were not normally distributed for most questions on the Brief IPQ. The correlations found between items on the Brief IPQ were understandable in the context of advanced disease. MAC helplessness-hopelessness and fighting spirit were highly correlated with items on the Brief IPQ in opposite directions. The Brief IPQ domains of consequences, identity, concern, personal control, and emotion were associated with depression, a relationship that was not explained by adaptive coping. Seven causal attribution themes were identified: don't know, personal responsibility, exposure, pathological process, intrinsic personal factors, chance, fate or luck, and other. Both lung cancer diagnosis and gender were found to be independently associated with personal responsibility attribution. None of the attribution themes were associated with the presence of depression. Conclusion.

These findings support the relevance of the bidimensional conception of BJW and the predictions related to causal attribution theory and the just world hypothesis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.2224/sbp.2012.40.3.433,belief in a just world; causal attribution; workplace gender equality; self/other distinction;Workplace,,

Design: Cross-sectional in-depth qualitative interviews. Setting: Outpatient service in Toronto, Ontario. Participants: Ten women with symptoms of depression aged between 22 and 65 years of age. Seven were from India, two from Sri Lanka and one from Pakistan. Four were Muslim, three Hindu and three Catholic. Two participants had university degrees, one a high school diploma and seven had completed less than a high school education. Eight were married, one was unmarried and one a widow. Results: Three main factors emerged from the participant narratives as the causes of depression: family and relationships, culture and migration and socioeconomic. The majority of the participants identified domestic abuse, marital problems and interpersonal problems in the family as the cause of their depression. Culture and migration and socioeconomic factors were considered contributory. None of our study participants reported spiritual, supernatural or religious factors as causes of depression. Conclusion: A personal-social-cultural model emerged as the aetiological paradigm for depression. Given the perceived causation, psycho-social treatment methods may be more acceptable for South Asian origin women.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000641,Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,

Efforts aimed at addressing female suicide must be based on understanding their perceived causes and the meaning of this behavior. Aims: This study describes the perceived causes of suicidal behaviors to determine preventive measures of female suicide in China. Methods: An in-depth interview about the process and causes of suicidal behavior as well as a detailed structured and a standardized diagnostic interview were administered to 244 female attempters treated at general hospitals and, separately, to their relatives. Results: The perceived three most frequent causes of the attempts were interpersonal conflict (87\%), psychological problems (33\%), and conflict between others that affected the subject (27\%). On average 2.2 causes were identified for each case. The identification in the in-depth interviews of psychological problems as a cause of the attempt was concordant with the results of the independent psychiatric exam identifying a current DSM-IV mental disorder in 38\% of cases (Kappa = 0.64).

The misattribution of these behaviors may lead to a lack of consideration and public censure if the individual is seen as simply misbehaving. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the impact of visual cues indicating the presence or absence of brain injury on prejudice, desire for social interaction, and causal attributions of nursing and computing science students. Method: An independent-groups design was employed in this research, which recruited 190 first-year nursing students and 194 first-year computing science students from a major university in Belfast, UK. A short passage describing an adolescent's behavior after a brain injury, together with one of three images portraying a young adolescent with a scar, a head dressing, or neither of these, was given to participants. They were then asked to answer questions relating to prejudice, social interaction, locus of control, and causal attributions. The attributional statements suggested that the character's behavior could be the result of brain injury or adolescence. Results: Analysis of variance demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the student groups, where nursing students (M = 45.17, SD = 4.69) desired more social interaction with the fictional adolescent than their computer science peers (M = 38.64, SD = 7.69). Further, analysis of variance showed a main effect of image on the attributional statement that described adolescence as a suitable explanation for the character's lack of self-confidence. Discussion: Attributions of brain injury were influenced by the presence of a visible but potentially specious indicator of injury. This suggests that survivors of brain injury who do not display any outward indicator may receive less care and face expectations to behave in a manner consistent with the norms of society. If their injury does not allow them to meet with these expectations, they may face public censure and discrimination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1097/NNR.0b013e31823ca253,attributions; locus of control; nurse attitudes; survivors of brain injury;Brain Injuries;Adolescent;Brain;Causality;Survivors,,

Aims: To examine the role of beliefs about depression and schizophrenia in mediating the difference in preferred social distance towards individuals with these two disorders. Methods: In Study I, 200 undergraduates completed questionnaires concerning beliefs about depression or schizophrenia and willingness to interact with an individual who has one of the two disorders. In Study II, 103 members of a community service club completed similar measures. Results: For both samples, beliefs about likely appropriateness of social behaviour showed evidence of mediating differences in preferred level of social distance. In addition, differences in perceived danger may have been a mediator for the undergraduate sample and perceived prognosis for the service club respondents. Conclusions: Beliefs about social appropriateness, danger and prognosis, which have implications for likely costs and benefits of interaction, are more likely to mediate differences in social distance towards the disorders than beliefs concerning causation or continuity with normal experience.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1177/0020764010387062,schizophrenia; depression; stigmatization; diagnosis; stereotypes; social distance;Schizophrenia,,

This article highlights and assesses the usefulness of two theoretically derived variables for increasing the social support received by all depressed individuals: (a) affect and (b) social support outcome expectations. In accord with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's bilingual campaign, the authors conducted two studies using intercepts at 2 swap meets in the U. S. Southwest. One study sample consisted of Spanish-dominant Hispanics, the other non-Hispanics. For both samples, results indicate that affect, social support outcome expectations, and their interaction accounted for more than 50\% of the variance of social support intentions (67\% in the Hispanic sample when familism was considered). Affect is commonplace in the helping behavior literature; results indicate social support outcome expectations deserve equal consideration. Moreover, an unexpected finding emerged: Perceiving a lack of willpower, need for attention, and lack of moral character to be the cause of depression resulted in increased sympathy among the Hispanic sample but increased anger among non-Hispanics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1080/10810730.2011.635775,Social Support,,

For example, in rodents and humans, the learned helplessness (LH) effect describes a specific deficit in behaviour to control aversive stimuli that is induced by prior exposure to uncontrollable aversive stimuli. The LH effect is objective and valid in that the cause of the behavioural deficit, namely uncontrollability, is clear; furthermore, the deficit induced is underlain by emotional, motivational and cognitive processes that are relevant to depression psychopathology. As a further example, helplessness, hopelessness, external locus of control and causal attribution are inter-related and major themes in psychological theories (primarily cognitive theories) of depression. Despite this broad interest in helplessness, it can be argued that its potential usefulness as a scientific and clinical concept has so far not been investigated optimally, including with respect to its application in research aimed at development of improved anti-depressant pharmacotherapy. The first aim of this review was to describe and integrate the psychological evidence and the neurobiological evidence for the LH effect in rodents and healthy humans and for helplessness in depressed patients. The second aim was to conduct three systematic reviews, namely of rodent studies of the LH effect, rodent studies of effects of psychopharmacological agents on the LH effect, and human studies of efficacy of pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic treatment on helplessness in depressed patients. With respect to the first aim, the major findings are: the specificity of the LH effect in otherwise non-manipulated rodents and healthy humans has been under-estimated, and the LH effect is a specific learned aversive uncontrollability (LAU) effect. There is theoretical and empirical support for a model in which a specific LAU effect induced by a life event of major emotional significance can function as an aetiological factor for generalised helplessness which can in turn function as an aetiological and maintenance factor for depression. However, to date such models have focused on cognitive mediating processes whereas it is emotional motivational cognitive processes (as proposed for the LAU effect) that need to be invoked and understood. The evidence is for analogous neural processes underlying the LAU effect in rodents and healthy humans and helplessness in depression, with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibiting aversive uncontrollability-dependent activity. With respect to the second aim, the major findings are: the LAU effect is demonstrated quite consistently using a number of different paradigms in rat but is poorly studied in mouse. The rat LAU effect can be reversed by chronic administration of monoamine reuptake inhibitors. The effects of antidepressants on human helplessness have been scarcely studied to-date. The major conclusion is that the LAU effect and generalised helplessness constitute major neuropsychological concepts of high value to future translational research aimed at increased understanding of depression and development of novel, improved antidepressant treatments.

Causal attributions are thought to be involved in help seeking behavior, time to diagnosis and the chance for successful referral. Yet, little is known about the extent to which these processes are influenced by causal attributions. 120 patients, involved in the nationwide second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (Schellevis, Westert, \& Bakker, 2005), with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of depression, severe depression or with a depression lasting over six months, completed a causal attributions inventory. Demographic and clinical data from the survey, and causal attribution scores were used as independent variables in association with getting a diagnosis of depression from the general practitioner, or being in treatment by a mental health care provider for more than 3 sessions. Causal attributions related to intrapsychic fears were significantly associated with getting a diagnosis of depression and successful referral. Causal attributions related to childhood were also positively associated with successful referral. In association models derived from all the demographic and clinical data available in the survey, causal attributions substantially contributed to the explained variance, 55\% and 39\% respectively. The findings suggest causal attributions have a statistically significant impact on time to diagnosis and the chance of successful referral.

Aims To investigate whether biogenetic causal attributions of mental illness among the general public are associated with more tolerant attitudes, whether such attributions are related to lower perceptions of guilt and responsibility, to what extent notions of responsibility are associated with rejection of people who are mentally ill, and how prevalent notions of responsibility are among the general public with regard to different mental disorders. Method A systematic review was conducted of representative population studies examining attitudes towards people with mental illness and beliefs about such disorders. Results We identified 33 studies relevant to this review. Generally, biogenetic causal attributions were not associated with more tolerant attitudes; they were related to stronger rejection in most studies examining schizophrenia. No published study reported on associations of biogenetic causal attributions and perceived responsibility. The stereotype of self-responsibility was unrelated to rejection in most studies. Public images of mental disorder are generally dominated by the stereotypes of unpredictability and dangerousness, whereas responsibility is less relevant.

Methods: A large population-based public survey with community dwelling adults (N = 1046) ascertained through random digit dialling. Attitudes were assessed via structured interviews. Results: Intention to start therapies or courses to learn to develop better strategies to cope with stress (80\%) was significantly and positively associated with self-estimation of risk for major depressive disorder as higher than average (beta = 0.12, p = 0.001); endorsement of family environment as a causal attribution (beta = 0.11, p<0.001); and endorsement of gene-environment interaction as a causal mechanism of mental illness (8 = 0.12, p = 0.017). Intention to modify potential life stressors (84\%) was significantly and positively associated with self-estimation of risk for depression as higher than average (beta = 0.07, p = 0.029); endorsement of `abuse' as a causal attribution (beta = 0.10, p = 0.003); and endorsement of `gene-environment interaction' as a causal mechanism (beta = 0.10, p = 0.002). Limitations: The hypothetical nature of the genetic risk scenario may have weakened participants' sensitivity to the potential personal impact of such a genetic test result. Conclusions: Perceptions that modifiable environmental factors strongly contribute to overall risk of major depressive disorder appeared to drive willingness to engage in risk-modifying interventions in the hypothetical scenario of a genetic predisposition. Our results suggest that screening for genetic risk in consort with environmental risk factor assessment has potential community acceptability and clinical value as an early intervention and preventive tool for high risk groups.

We carried out a study of Chinese patients'(n = 118) and relatives' (n = 78) views of illness severity, attribution of cause, concern about developing illness, and effect of schizophrenia on family planning. A comparison sample of English-survey respondents was also obtained, using the same series of questions (n = 42 patients, n = 127 relatives). Fewer Chinese patients and family members rated schizophrenia as very severe (33\%) than did the predominantly North American respondents (67\%, p<0.0001). The pattern of attribution of cause differed between samples (p<0.0001), favoring environmental alone in the Chinese sample (52\%), with a low frequency of genetics alone (9\%). Although comparatively fewer Chinese respondents were very concerned about developing schizophrenia themselves or about the risk of illness in their families (21\%), this high level of concern was more common in family members (28\%). Finally, Chinese respondents were somewhat less likely to indicate that schizophrenia impacted on family planning decisions (31\%) than were English-survey respondents (45\%, p = 0.02). The descriptive findings contribute to understanding schizophrenia in China. The comparative findings must be regarded as preliminary, since differences in demographics could influence results. The present findings suggest that understanding patients' and families' attributions of cause of schizophrenia may be important for developing a shared model of illness in order to decrease stigmatization, and improve therapeutic alliances.

The objective of this study was to examine the associations between biological, psychosocial, and medical causal beliefs in depression and stigma against depression. Methods: We randomly recruited participants in Alberta, aged 18-74 (n=3047, response rate 75.2\%), for a cross-sectional telephone survey between February and June 2006, using random digit dialing. Participants were presented with a case vignette describing a depressed individual and responded to a personal stigma and depression causation questionnaire. Stigma scores were analyzed using Wald tests and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Nearly all respondents endorsed a psychosocial (99.1\%) or genetic (96.4\%) cause of depression. Participants who endorsed genetic cause of depression had a lower mean stigma scores than others. Logistic regression modeling showed that endorsing depression due to ``being a nervous person{''} was associated with increased odds of having stigmatizing attitudes. Limitations: Recall and social desirability response biases were possible due to reliance on self report. Conclusions: It is encouraging that 99\% of participants endorsed a psychosocial cause of depression.

However, they are ill prepared for such a role and little is known about their attitudes toward depression, which may affect practice. Aim: To investigate CFs' attitudes toward depression and compare them to those of (mental) health professionals and nurses. Method: Attitudes were assessed in participants (n = 2,670) of training programmes about depression in nine countries of the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD). The EAAD questionnaire included attitudes toward depression and its treatment, perceived causes, preferred treatment options, and knowledge of depression symptoms. Results: CFs and nurses had a more negative attitude toward patients with depression and toward antidepressants, and more limited knowledge of depression symptoms than (mental) health professionals. CFs more frequently supported nonstandard treatment for depression. Nurse assistants clearly differed from registered nurses with their attitudes being among the least favourable and their knowledge the most limited of all groups. Conclusions: CFs and nurses had less favourable attitudes and more limited knowledge regarding depression when compared to mental health professionals and doctors. This may negatively affect professional collaboration, challenge optimal treatment and stigmatize patients. CFs' and nurses' knowledge and attitudes may be similar to those of the general population and be related to a lack of training in mental health issues.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0020764009359742,depression; attitude; community facilitators; nurses; mental health professionals;Pilot Projects,,

Little is known though about these associations in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present study aimed to investigate the relationship of defensive coping and HRQL among patients in different CKD stages, after adjusting for psychological distress, sociodemographic and disease-related variables. Methods: The sample consisted of 98 CKD patients, attending a university nephrology department. Seventy-nine (79) pre-dialysis patients of disease stages 3 to 4 and 19 dialysis patients were included. HRQL was assessed by the 36-item Short-Form health survey (SF-36), defensive coping by the Rationality/Emotional Defensiveness (R/ED) scale of the Lifestyle Defense Mechanism Inventory (LDMI) and psychological distress by the depression and anxiety scales of the revised Hopkins Symptom CheckList (SCL-90-R). Regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between SF-36 dimensions and defensive coping style. Results: Patients on dialysis had worse scores on SF-36 scales measuring physical aspects of HRQL. In the fully adjusted analysis, a higher defensive coping score was significantly associated with a lower score on the mental component summary (MCS) scale of the SF-36 (worse mental health). In contrast, a higher defensive score showed a small positive association with the physical component summary (PCS) scale of the SF-36 (better health), but this was marginally significant. Conclusions: The results provided evidence that emotional defensiveness as a coping style tends to differentially affect the mental and the physical component of HRQL in CKD. Clinicians should be aware of the effects of long-term denial and could examine the possibility of screening for defensive coping and depression in recently diagnosed CKD patients with the aim to improve both physical and mental health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: indirectly related?",10.1186/1471-2369-12-28,Quality of Life;Kidney Diseases;Kidney;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,

Joris",,English,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Background. A serious life event is likely to shape attributions relating to symptoms experienced afterwards. While they may play an important role in prognosis and seeking care, such perceptions have hardly been studied among survivors of a disaster. Objective. To investigate the association between self-reported health problems that have been attributed to an extreme life event and the symptoms presented to GPs. Methods. A two-wave longitudinal survey (2-3 weeks and 18 months) among survivors of a fireworks disaster was combined with a continuous morbidity surveillance in general practice. Symptoms attributed to the disaster reported in an open-ended question in the two waves were analysed using descriptive statistics. Differences in presented symptoms over time were analysed using logistic multilevel analysis. Results. More than half of the respondents reported health problems, which were, in their opinion, related to the disaster. Psychological problems were most frequently reported in association with the disaster, and in contrast to physical attributed symptoms, presentation of these problems in general practice decreased over time. In the total sample, musculoskeletal symptoms were less frequently presented in the longer term. Survivors who attributed symptoms to the disaster at both waves or after 18 months only most often presented such symptoms to the GP. Conclusion. Survivors attributed psychological problems and physical symptoms to the disaster at short-term and midterm post-disaster. Most of these survivors presented such symptoms to the GP. Attribution of symptoms to an extreme life event such as a disaster may therefore require special attention from the GP.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/fampra/cmq114,Causal attributions; disasters; family medicine; illness perceptions; symptoms,,

Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a probabilistic sample of 500 individuals who live in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and are aged between 18 and 65 years. A structured questionnaire was used, and it was applied in person. Questionnaire began with the presentation of a vignette describing an individual with schizophrenia (according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria). This was followed by questions that assessed perceived negative reactions and discrimination, perceived dangerousness and emotional reactions in relation to the case presented in the vignette. Results: People with schizophrenia were perceived as potentially dangerous by 74.2\% of interviewees. In addition, 59.0\% of the sample perceived them as capable of arousing negative reactions, and 57.2\% as capable of arousing discrimination in society. However, emotional reactions reported by the interviewees themselves were mainly pro-social in nature. The most important factors associated with these responses were: attribution of ``biological{''} causes and perceived dangerousness. Conclusion: This study indicated that beliefs related to public stigma towards people with schizophrenia are commonly held in Sao Paulo city. An important focus for future studies is to investigate the scope and impact of public stigma on the everyday experiences of people with schizophrenia in the Brazilian context.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1590/S1516-44462010005000004,Schizophrenia; Discrimination (Psychology); Public opinion; Attitude to health; Brazil;Schizophrenia,,

It is important to understand cultural differences in patients' ideas about mental illness in treatment settings. The aim of the present study was to investigate differences in illness perceptions between Maori and New Zealand Europeans diagnosed with schizophrenia. Method: A total of 111 users of mental health services (68 Maori, 43 New Zealand European) in the greater Auckland and Northland areas who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder were interviewed using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and the Drug Attitude Inventory. District Health Board staff completed the Global Assessment of Functioning for each patient. Results: Maori with schizophrenia believed that their illness would continue significantly less time than New Zealand European patients did. Chance or spiritual factors were listed as causes of mental illness by only five Maori patients and no New Zealand European patients. Other illness perceptions, as well as attitudes towards medication, were comparable between groups. Across groups, the top perceived causes were drugs/alcohol, family relationships/abuse, and biological causes. Conclusion: Illness perceptions provide a framework to assess patients' beliefs about their mental illness. Differences between Maori and New Zealand European patients' beliefs about their mental illness may be related to traditional Maori beliefs about mental illness. Knowledge of differences in illness perceptions provides an opportunity to design effective clinical interventions for both Maori and New Zealand Europeans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.3109/00048674.2011.561479,perception; schizophrenia; cross-cultural comparison; medicine - indigenous;Schizophrenia;New Zealand,,

The article begins by discussing the perceived causes of poverty and their taxonomic properties (locus, stability, and controllability). One antecedent of causal beliefs, political ideology, is then examined in detail, followed by a review of the effects of causal beliefs on emotions and behavior. It is contended that helping the poor is a moral issue, but the moral evaluation concerns the targeted recipient of aid rather than the potential help giver. Persons perceived as responsible for their plight, a dominant construal for conservatives, elicit anger and neglect. In contrast, those seen as not responsible for their financial hardship, an outlook predominantly endorsed by liberals, arouse sympathy and help giving. Sympathy is the most important proximal determinant of aid. This analysis is extended to reactions to achievement failure, abortion, and rape.

This paper's aim is to understand how certain patients come to be perceived and labelled as `difficult' patients in community mental health care, through mixed-methods research in The Netherlands between June 2006 and October 2009. A literature review, a Delphi-study among experts, a survey study among professionals, a Grounded Theory interview study among `difficult' patients, and three case studies of `difficult' patients were undertaken. Analysis of the results of these qualitative and quantitative studies took place within the concept of the sick role, and resulted in the construction of a tentative explanatory model. The `difficult' patient-label is associated with professional pessimism, passive treatment and possible discharge or referral out of care. The label is given by professionals when certain patient characteristics are present and a specific causal attribution (psychological, social or moral versus neurobiological) about the patient's behaviours is made. The status of `difficult' patient is easily reinforced by subsequent patient and professional behaviour, turning initial unusual help-seeking behaviour into `difficult' or ineffective chronic illness behaviour, and ineffective professional behaviour. These findings illustrate that the course of mental illness, or at least the course of patients' contact with mental health professionals and services, is determined by patient and professional and reinforced by the social and mental health care system. This model adds to the broader sick role concept a micro-perspective in which attribution and learning principles are incorporated. On a practical level, it implies that professionals need to look into their own role in the perpetuation of difficult behaviours as described here. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a novel experimental methodology to investigate paranoid ideas in individuals without a history of mental illness. Aims: We aimed to determine whether this paradigm could elicit unfounded paranoid thoughts and whether these thoughts could be predicted by factors from a cognitive model. Method: Fifty-eight individuals took part and completed measures assessing trait paranoia, mood, self and other schema and attributional style. They were exposed to two experimental events: 1) an interruption to the testing session by a stooge, and 2) a recording of laughter played outside the testing room and subsequently asked about their explanations for these events. Results: 15.5\% (n = 9) of the sample gave a paranoid explanation for at least one of the experimental events. The remainder reported generally neutral explanations. Individuals with a paranoid explanation reported significantly higher levels of trait paranoia. Factors predictive of a paranoid interpretation were interpersonal sensitivity and attributional style. Conclusions: The results show that spontaneous paranoid explanations can be elicited in non-clinical individuals, even for quite neutral events. In line with current theories, the findings suggest that emotional processes contribute to paranoid interpretations of events, although, as a novel study with a modest sample, it requires replication.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1017/S1352465810000457,Paranoia; persecutory delusions; experimental design.,,

An electronic search using MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Academic Search Complete was carried out for studies that evaluated the effectiveness of educational interventions. Forty eligible studies were identified. There were three types of educational interventions (Educational condition, Video-based Contact condition and Contact condition). Eighteen of 23 studies reported significant improvements in knowledge, 27 of 34 studies yielded significant changes in attitudes towards people with mental illness. Significant effects in social distance were found in 16 of 20 studies. Two of five studies significantly improved young people's awareness of mental illness.

In the field of psychology, and mainly in the personality area, the atributional style has a great relevance, when understanding the causal attributions like mechanisms of facing that guide the conduct of the subject. In this way, we see the importance that supposes the study of the dysfunctional attribution to be able to replace it on the other adaptive, mainly in the pathologies where delusions beliefs exist. In the present investigation the influence has been analyzed that carries out the variable attributional style and the self-esteem in the delusional ideas (defined by the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders {[}DSM-IV] as ``false belief based on the realization of incorrect inferences about external reality, beliefs that are held firmly believe despite of almost everyone else, and despite of constitutes an obvious proof or evidence otherwise indisputable.) in a sample of delusional patients in comparison with a group control. Most of the research, focus on the dimension of ``Internal{''} in this study (following previous research), is to examine attributional biases in the reasoning of delirious patients. Therefore, the departure hypotheses are the following: a) the delusional patients, more than the normal subjects, will realise in their social reasoning more external attributions for the negative events that stop the positives; b) the delusional patients, like the control group, tend to realise global and excessively stable attributions, as much for positive events as for negative events; and c.) the delusional patients in comparison with the control group will indicate a high self-esteem. Patients and methods To carry out this research both self-esteem and attributional style have been tested in a sample of 20 delusional in-patients (85\% are men and 15\% women of average age of 36.20 years) entered the unit of Rehabilitation of a Psychiatric Hospital of Santiago de Compostela (Spain) and have been compared to 40 normal control subject in age and sex with the experimental group that do not own psychiatric history, no upheaval that requires treatment. The criteria of inclusion have been the following: a) all of the patients were entered the unit of Rehabilitation, b) the patients had delusional ideas at the moment of the tests, c) their diagnosis fulfilled the criteria according to DSM-IV for paranoid schizophrenia (16 patients) and delusions upheaval (paranoid) (4 patients), d) the ages of the patients had to be included between 20 and 50 years, e) none of the patients had a history of drug use, f) patient did not show evidence of organic brain disorders, g) all of them had a score in items 1 (delusion), 5 (magnitude), and 6 (mistrust/damage) in the positive scale of PANSS (PANSS-P) of more than 3, and h) all the patients had more than 5 years of disease. One is comparative, observational, and cross-sectional and homodemic a study according to the propose classification by Feinstein and with a design of cases and controls. The instruments applied in the study were: a) Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (EA), is an instrument for assessing the patient's global self-esteem; b) Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ), which is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of twelve situations, six positive (success) and six negative (failure), against which the subject must indicate the causes they attribute its occurrence; and c) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), suitable for evaluation of positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Of the thirty items included in the PANSS, seven are positive scale (PANSS-P), seven the negative scale (PANSS-N), and the sixteen remaining general psychopathology scale (PANSS-PG). All the instruments used for the study, count on their corresponding data of reliability and validity. In this investigation a descriptive analysis of the object of study has been carried out variable, which provided us the frequency allocation, percentage, averages, medians and standard deviations for each of them. Results The results of this investigation show that the delusional patients realised more external attributions for the negative events that the group normal control, and more internal for the positives. The delusional patients realised a causal attribution in stability and globality for the negative events similar to the one of the normal ones. Nevertheless, before positive events have been significant differences between both groups in relation to the stability, not thus for the globality. Also the delusional patients, like the group normal control, indicated a high self-esteem. In the statistic analysis has not been significant differences in self-esteem between the delusional group and the group control that the hypothesis supports that the delusional ones have a high self-esteem with respect to the normal ones. Conclusion The hypothesis raised by Bantall has not been able to state in this investigation, since when analyzing the variable self-esteem we observed that their scores are similar to the group control of normal. According to the atribucional style, one concludes that the delusional subjects tend to blame their failures and errors to the other people or other circumstances. On the other hand, when they are successful in some situation, they consider that it must to them themselves, attributing the favourable events to internal level. The conclusions of the analysis of the globality dimension, which determines the temporary generalization of the expectation, do not fulfil the hypothesis in which it affirmed that the delusional subjects, like the normal ones, excessively realised global attributions as much for positive facts as for negative, but do not indicate an exaggerated slant towards the excessive globality. The hypothesis raised by Bentall that the delusion reflect a defensive atribucional style, which protects the individual against feelings of low self-esteem, has not been possible to state in this investigation, since when analyzing the variable self-esteem we observed that significant differences in the delusional patients do not exist, since their scores are similar to the group control, showing a both high self-esteem. By all this, it is possible to be concluded that it enters the delusional patients and the group control only exists significant differences taking care of the atribucional style of each group. However, such studies contribute along with other made in the understanding of these disorders and consequently to the development of effective psychological program with the aim of improving the symptoms of these patients and even in other pathologies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",,Attributions; cognitive bias; delusions; self-esteem;Delusions,,

Can we address this question by using together 2 major methods for causal inference: natural experiments and specialized statistical methods? Objective: To determine the causal relationship between dependent stressful life events (dSLEs) and prior depressive episodes (PDEs) and major depression (MD). Design: Assessment of risk factors and episodes of MD at interview. Statistical analyses used the co-twin control and propensity score-matching methods. Setting: General community. Participants: Four thousand nine hundred ten male and female twins from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. Main Outcome Measure: Episodes of MD. Results: We found that dSLEs were strongly associated with risk for MD in female (odds ratio {[}OR], 5.85) and male (4.55) twins in the entire sample and, at consider-ably lower levels, in female (2.29) and male (2.19) mono-zygotic twins discordant for dSLE exposure. A case-control sample matched on propensity score showed a moderate association in female (OR, 1.79) and male (1.53) twins. A PDE strongly predicted risk for MD in female (OR, 3.68) and male (5.20) twins in the entire sample. In monozygotic pairs discordant for exposure, the association was weaker in male (OR, 1.41) and absent in female (1.00) twins. A case-control sample matched on propensity score showed a moderate association between PDE and depressive episodes in male (OR, 1.58) and female twins (1.66). Conclusions: Although dSLEs have a modest causal effect on the risk for MD, a large proportion of the observed association is noncausal. The same pattern is seen for PDEs, although the causal impact is somewhat more tenuous. For environmental exposures in psychiatry that cannot be studied experimentally, co-twin control and propensity scoring methods-which have complementary strengths and weaknesses-can provide similar results, suggesting their joint use can help with the critical question of causal inference.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not sure",10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.136,"",,

The authors examined the impact of this approach with a 10-year comparison of public endorsement of treatment and prejudice. Method: The authors analyzed responses to vignettes in the mental health modules of the 1996 and 2006 General Social Survey describing individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, major depression, and alcohol dependence to explore whether more of the public 1) embraces neurobiological understandings of mental illness; 2) endorses treatment from providers, including psychiatrists; and 3) reports community acceptance or rejection of people with these disorders. Multivariate analyses examined whether acceptance of neurobiological causes increased treatment support and lessened stigma. Results: In 2006, 67\% of the public attributed major depression to neurobiological causes, compared with 54\% in 1996. High proportions of respondents endorsed treatment, with general increases in the proportion endorsing treatment from doctors and specific increases in the proportions endorsing psychiatrists for treatment of alcohol dependence (from 61\% in 1996 to 79\% in 2006) and major depression (from 75\% in 1996 to 85\% in 2006). Social distance and perceived danger associated with people with these disorders did not decrease significantly. Holding a neurobiological conception of these disorders increased the likelihood of support for treatment but was generally unrelated to stigma. Where associated, the effect was to increase, not decrease, community rejection. Conclusions: More of the public embraces a neurobiological understanding of mental illness. This view translates into support for services but not into a decrease in stigma. Reconfiguring stigma reduction strategies may require providers and advocates to shift to an emphasis on competence and inclusion.

The perceived responsibility of persons with mental illness for their condition, as well as fear and social distance, was assessed by self-report. Automatic associations between Mental Illness and Guilt and between Self and Guilt were measured by the Brief Implicit Association Test. Among the general public, endorsement of biogenetic models was associated with not only less perceived responsibility, but also greater social distance. Among people with mental illness, endorsement of genetic models had only negative correlates: greater explicit fear and stronger implicit self-guilt associations.

Methods - Cross-sectional survey on a sample of 50 people with clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia recruited in the Italian INDIGO sites of Verona and Brescia. The 41-item interview-based Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC-10), which assesses how experienced and anticipated discrimination affects the life of people with schizophrenia, was used. Results - The most frequently occurring areas of experienced discrimination were discrimination by family members (44\%), making and keeping friends (33\%), keeping (36\%) and finding a job (34\%), getting or keeping a driving licence (32\%). Anticipated discrimination was common in applying for work, training or education (58\%), looking for close relationships (50\%) and doing something important (48\%); 68\% felt the need to conceal their diagnosis. Positive experiences were rare, and getting welfare benefits/disability pensions was the only area where participants reported being treated with advantage (34\%) more commonly than with disadvantage (8\%). Overall, experienced discrimination reported by Italian patients was in the intermediate position of the score range of all INDIGO sites, whereas anticipated discrimination was lower than that reported in the other countries. Conclusions - Interventions to reduce discrimination against people with schizophrenia may need to address both actual and anticipated discrimination. Targeted therapeutic strategies aiming to improve self-esteem of people with schizophrenia may be useful to facilitate their social participation and full inclusion in the community.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",,stigma; discrimination; schizophrenia;Discrimination (Psychology),,

Considering that studies exploring patients' view on controversial topics have contributed to our understanding of important clinical issues, it is surprising how little these views have been explored to add to our understanding of the link between cannabis and psychosis. The present study was designed to elucidate whether patients with schizophrenia who use cannabis believe that its use has caused their schizophrenia and to explore these patients other beliefs and perceptions about the effects of the drug. Methods: We recruited ten consecutive patients fulfilling criteria for paranoid schizophrenia and for a harmful use of/dependence from cannabis (ICD-10 F20.0 + F12.1 or F12.2) from the in- and outpatient clinic of the Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich. They were interviewed using qualitative methodology. Furthermore, information on amount, frequency, and effects of use was obtained. A grounded theory approach to data analysis was taken to evaluate findings. Results: None of the patients described a causal link between the use of cannabis and their schizophrenia. Disease models included upbringing under difficult circumstances (5) or use of substances other than cannabis (e. g. hallucinogens, 3). Two patients gave other reasons. Four patients considered cannabis a therapeutic aid and reported that positive effects (reduction of anxiety and tension) prevailed over its possible disadvantages (exacerbation of positive symptoms). Conclusions: Patients with schizophrenia did not establish a causal link between schizophrenia and the use of cannabis. We suggest that clinicians consider our findings in their work with patients suffering from these co-occurring disorders. Withholding treatment or excluding patients from certain treatment settings like day-care facilities or in patient care because of their use of cannabis, may cause additional harm to this already heavily burdened patient group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/1477-7517-7-22,Schizophrenia;Cannabis,,

In both studies higher scores on negative attributions were related to higher perceived criticism ratings.

Since biomedical models may exacerbate these concerns, we hypothesized that unlike within the general population, biological causal attributions would relate to increased stigma among Orthodox Jews. Consequently, we also examined the attitudinal correlates of stigmatization of obsessive-compulsive disorder within the Orthodox community, as measured by both social distance and family/marriage concerns. Results indicated that, unlike previous research, biological models were associated with greater marriage/family stigma, and did not predict less social distance. This suggests that biomedical approaches may increase salient aspects of stigma within the Orthodox community, and clinical practice should be sensitive to these concerns.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181e07d99,Stigma; orthodox; jews; medical model; mental illness;Mentally Ill Persons;Jews;Stereotyping,,

Common ways of describing individuals with such problems may perpetuate or diminish stigmatizing attitudes yet little research exists to inform this debate. We sought to determine whether referring to an individual as ``a substance abuser{''} vs. ``having a substance use disorder{''} evokes different judgments about behavioral self-regulation, social threat, and treatment vs. punishment. Method: A randomized, between-subjects, cross-sectional design was utilized. Participants were asked to read a vignette containing one of the two terms and to rate their agreement with a number of related statements. Clinicians (N = 516) attending two mental health conferences (63\% female, 81\% white, M age 51; 65\% doctoral-level) completed the study (71\% response rate). A Likert-scaled questionnaire with three subscales {[}{''}perpetrator-punishment{''} (alpha =.80); ``social threat{''} (alpha = .86); ``victim-treatment{''} (alpha = .64)] assessed the perceived causes of the problem, whether the character was a social threat, able to regulate substance use, and should receive therapeutic vs. punitive action. Results: No differences were detected between groups on the social threat or victim-treatment subscales. However, a difference was detected on the perpetrator-punishment scale. Compared to those in the ``substance use disorder{''} condition, those in the ``substance abuser{''} condition agreed more with the notion that the character was personally culpable and that punitive measures should be taken. Conclusions: Even among highly trained mental health professionals, exposure to these two commonly used terms evokes systematically different judgments. The commonly used ``substance abuser{''} term may perpetuate stigmatizing attitudes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Results Although most people regard alcoholism as an illness, there is a strong tendency to blame those affected for their condition. Psycho-social causal attributions prevail over biologic explanations. Most people regard alcohol dependent persons as unpredictable and dangerous. The desire for social distance is stronger towards alcohol dependent persons than towards those with other psychiatric diagnoses such as depression or schizophrenia; only those addicted to illegal drugs suffer stronger rejection.

Methods: Two-hundred and nine middle-aged and older Korean American immigrants completed a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Korean American immigrants had strong stigma about AD and interpreted the disease as a form of insanity. They considered memory loss and AD as a part of the aging process. They seriously lacked knowledge about the treatment, diagnosis and cause of AD. Those who were less acculturated and less exposed to AD were likely to have poorer AD knowledge. Conclusions: There is a need to expand AD education efforts among Korean American immigrants because the views of stigmatization and normalization of AD combined with certain Asian cultural norms can be barriers to early recognition and intervention.

The aim of this study was to explore the association of minor affective psychopathology and the regular use of psychotropic medication with temperament and character profiles from Cloninger's personality model, in a sample of active professional people. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 498 non-clinical subjects, teachers in a local school system. Instruments used included the self-administered General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) to measure psychiatric morbidity; the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) to measure depressive symptoms; documentation of regular use of psychotropic medication; and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125) for personality traits self-assessment. Results: The proportion of subjects presenting psychiatric morbidity (GHQ-28>6) or depressive symptoms (CES-D>20) was significantly higher among explosive, passive-aggressive, and obsessional temperament profiles. and among schizotypal, moody, melancholic and dependent character profiles. Similar results were observed with the scores on each of the four GHQ-28 subscales (depression, anxiety, social dysfunction, and somatic symptoms). The regular use of psychotropic medications was significantly higher among the passive-aggressive and explosive temperament types, and among the schizoptypal and moody character types. Limitations: Being a cross-sectional study, no causal attributions can be inferred. Subjects on sick leave were excluded, so the sample was not representative of the general population. The data were collected using self-reporting questionnaires, and no specific psychiatric diagnoses were obtained. Conclusions: It is possible to identify certain personality configurations associated with minor psychopathology and concomitant use of psychotropics, among active professional people.

In particular, the 30-item list of etiological attributions developed by Angermeyer and colleagues has been used to describe causal beliefs in patients, family members, and lay community members within such communities. The current study, the first examination of the latent or factorial structure of these 30 causal beliefs, seeks to provide informative subscales that may enhance reliability and validity of groupings of causes for future analyses involving community members. Method Data were gathered from six separate surveys involving three distinct groups of individuals from the same community within the southeastern United States: lay community members, relatives of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and police officers at the start of a 1-week mental health training program. Results Exploratory factor analysis in the overall sample (n = 577) revealed four factors that were used to define four subscales, termed: personal/family/social stressors (14 items), inconsistent with modern conceptions of risk (8 items), external/environmental insults to the brain (6 items), and consistent with modern biological conceptions (2 items). Cronbach's internal consistency reliability coefficients for these subscales were 0.91, 0.83, 0.71, and 0.65, respectively. Conclusions These findings suggest that subscales could be derived to provide continuous measures for assessing causal beliefs in order to study how this concept relates to attitudes toward schizophrenia, the people affected by the disorder, and treatments that are recommended by mental health professionals.

Ratings differed significantly according to assigned causality. The vignette with the stuttering due to psychological causes was rated more negatively on 14 adjective pairs and the Social Distance Scale Index when compared to the ratings of vignettes with stuttering caused by either genetic or unknown causes.

The aims of this study were to explore the causal attributions of risk factors for CHD and to describe the relationship between their physiological status and causal attributions among immigrant Arabic, Turkish, and Iranian women living in Australia. Methods: Fifty-five women of Turkish, Iranian, and Persian backgrounds were recruited from community groups in metropolitan Sydney using snowball sampling and the assistance of bilingual health care workers. Body weight and blood pressure were assessed, and a questionnaire, including investigator-developed instruments and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, was administered. Health interpreters assisted with study procedures and translation of study instruments. Results: There was a low level of awareness of the risk of heart disease among women, although participants had knowledge of risk factors for heart disease broadly. The most highly attributed risk factors for CHD among participants were obesity, physical inactivity, and psychological distress. Women who rated highly on psychological distress scores were more likely to attribute negative emotions as causative factors for heart disease.

Methods: A national sample of 1,091 children were randomly assigned to read vignettes about a peer with depression, ADHD, or asthma and respond to an online survey. Causal attributions and social distance were assessed, and correlations were examined. Logistic regression models for each causal item tested main effects and interaction terms for conditions, demographic characteristics, and self-reported diagnosis. Results: The beliefs that parenting, substance abuse, and low effort caused the condition were all strongly intercorrelated and were moderately correlated with social distance. The depression condition was the strongest predictor of endorsement of the most stigmatizing causal beliefs. Stigmatizing causal beliefs were evident for ADHD, but with more modest effects. Children who reported a diagnosis were more likely to endorse parenting and substance abuse as causes (attenuated for ADHD). Modest to moderate effects were found for variation in causal beliefs across ethnic groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a consistent presence of stigmatization in children's beliefs about the causes of childhood mental health problems. Low effort, parenting, and substance abuse together tapped a moralistic and blaming view of mental health problems. The results reinforce the need to address stigmatization of mental disorders and the relative stigmatization of different causal beliefs. The findings of variation by ethnicity and diagnosis can inform and target antistigmatization efforts.

Methods: Male patients (n = 38) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, without substance abuse, and in contact with their families, were recruited at the time of hospital discharge. Patients' psychotic symptom levels were monitored every 2 weeks until follow-up, while family measures were administered at T1 and T2. The 4 predictor variables in the regression analysis were T I symptom levels of the patient and 3 measures of family interaction (expressed emotion, family burden, and family functioning). Results: The model based on the family variable, family burden at T1, and the patient variable, patients' remitted levels of psychotic symptoms at T1, was found to significantly predict the level of psychotic symptoms at T2. These 2 T1 variables made independent and additive contributions to the level of psychotic symptoms at T2, predicting 19\% of the variance.

Methods: A cross-sectional Study was conducted with a probabilistic sample of 500 individuals who live in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and are aged between 18 and 65 years. A structured questionnaire was used, and it was applied in person. Questionnaire began with the presentation of a vignette describing an individual with depression (according to DSM-IV and ICD-10). This was followed by a structured questionnaire that assessed perceived negative reactions and discrimination, perceived dangerousness and emotional reactions in relation to the case presented in the vignette. Results: individuals with depression were perceived as potentially dangerous by 56\% of interviewees. In addition, 49\% of the sample perceived them as capable of arousing negative reactions, and 41\%, as capable of arousing discrimination in society. However, emotional reactions reported by the interviewees themselves were mainly positive in nature.

Results. Medical and psychology students showed a substantial level of negative attitudes. Personal contact was negatively associated with stereotypes among medical students and positively associated among psychology students. Positive attitudes were related to biogenetic causal beliefs among medical students and to psychosocial causal beliefs among psychology students. Conclusions.

Our methods included conducting semi-structured interviews (n=48) with individuals with bipolar disorder (BPD) and unaffected siblings. Content analysis generated descriptive data that provide guidance for clinical interventions and themes to evaluate in future studies. The results showed that participants perceived increased personal and family risk, attributing BPD to genes and family environment. Causal attributions were often uncertain and at times inconsistent. Participants wished to modify psychiatric risk to relatives, but were uncertain how to do so; despite the uncertainty, most parents reported risk-modification efforts. Efforts to cope with family vulnerability included monitoring and cognitive distancing. Participants endorsed the usefulness of education and psychological support, but described more ambivalence about receiving risk assessment. Educational and supportive interventions around family risk for BPD should focus on perceptions of cause and vulnerability, reproductive decision-making, and early intervention and risk modification in young relatives. Psychological support is an important component. Providers should evaluate patient coping strategies, which could facilitate or hinder genetic counseling interventions, and should not assume interest in quantitative risk assessment.

To date, the empirical literature has tended to focus on the attitudes of experienced healthcare professionals working with adults who self-harm. Additionally, there has been few theory or model-driven studies to help identify what healthcare students think and feel about young people who self-harm. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to explore the way healthcare and non-healthcare students think and feel about adolescent self-harm behaviour using Corrigan et al.'s {[}Corrigan, P.W., Markowitz, F.E., Watson.

Participants: One hundred and eighty-four final-year students, covering health (medicine, nursing, clinical psychology) and non-health care (physics) professions. Methods: Students were presented with vignettes describing a young female who self-harms. Attributions of controllability were experimentally manipulated across the vignette conditions and students were asked to complete self-report questionnaires measuring attitudes towards self-harm. familiarity with self-harm and social desirability. Results: Consistent with the public discrimination model. students who believed that a young person was responsible for their self-harm reported higher feelings of anger towards them. Anger. in turn, was associated with a belief in the manipulatory nature of the self-harm and with less willingness to help. Perceived risk was found to be associated with higher levels of anxiety and increased support for the use of coercive and segregatory strategies to manage self-harming behaviour. Gender and student type were important influences on public stigma. with both men and medical students reporting more negative attitudes towards self-harm. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a number of factors may adversely affect the care and treatment received by young people who self-harm, namely: students' causal attributions, the gender and profession of healthcare students, and familiarity with self-harm behaviour.

Psychological autopsies focus almost exclusively on associated high-risk psychiatric disorders. New approaches considering contextual factors are needed for preventing suicide and promoting mental health. Aims: This study examined explanations of suicide reported by surviving family members or close friends with reference to social, cultural, and environmental conditions as well as the challenges of life in the Malavani slum of Mumbai. Methods: An EMIC (Explanatory Model Interview Catalog) interview based on a cultural epidemiological framework considered underlying problems, perceived causes, and sociocultural contexts. It was administered to survivors of 76 people who had died by suicide (56.6\% women). Results: Accounts of underlying problems typically referred to various aspects of tension (73.7\%). Perceived causes often identified multiple factors. The sociocultural contexts of suicide included the victimization of women, the personal and social impact of problem drinking, marital problems, physical health problems, mental tension, possession and sorcery. Women were particularly vulnerable to the impact of problem drinking by a spouse or father.

It also evaluated endorsement of genetic and environmental causal attributions of mental illness. Method: A qualitative approach using focus group methodology was selected as most appropriate because these issues are relatively unexplored. Participants (n = 36) aged >= 18 years from metropolitan Sydney discussed their understanding of the role of genetic and environmental risk factors in mental illness and attitudes towards pre-symptomatic interventions based on genetic risk information. Results: Thirty-six participants attended four focus groups involving 8-10 participants per group. Participants predominantly viewed genetic risk factors for depression as predisposing rather than causal, with environmental risk factors acting as triggers. Hypothetical identification with a genetic variant suggesting predisposition to depression prompted strong interest in seeking further information about predictive genetic testing from medical professionals, willingness to reduce life stress, drugs and alcohol intake, willingness to increase exercise, and willingness to undertake cognitive and behavioural interventions at a pre-symptomatic stage. Mixed views prevailed as to whether stress was a modifiable risk factor. Preventive intervention at a presymptomatic stage of depression was viewed negatively in a minority of participants due to a fatalistic attitude towards a genetic predisposition and attitudes that intervention was futile in the absence of symptoms. Conclusions: There is a likely public demand for preventive mental health interventions for healthy people on the basis of genetic susceptibility if predictive genetic testing becomes available in psychiatry. The findings have implications for general practitioner and public education about predictive genetic testing for susceptibility to common multifactorial disorders for at-risk groups.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.3109/00048670903179152,health behaviour; major depression; predictive genetic testing;Genetic Predisposition to Disease,,

The cultural epidemiology of deliberate self-harm (DSH), it is argued, is critical to planning for suicide prevention, community mental health and psychiatric practice. This study, based on a cultural epidemiological framework, compares male and female admissions for DSH, evaluating conditions with SCID-I and EMIC interviews. We assessed features and narratives of suicidal behavior, patient-identified underlying problems, their perceived causes and triggers. The study included 92 women and 104 men. A diagnosis of depressive disorder was made for 48.9 percent of women and 39.4 percent of men. Many patients (50.0 percent of women and 41.3 percent of men) did not fulfill the criteria for any diagnosis, or did so only for an adjustment disorder or a V-code. Men typically explained DSH with reference to work problems, financial problems and problem drinking. Women typically discussed domestic problems, in-law relations and victimization. Problem drinking affected women living with men who drank.

These aspects were tested for the first time using entire life narratives of 17 depressed inpatients and non-depressed controls matched for sex and educational level. Negative bias and depressive explanatory style were replicated as typical for the depressed group. Life narratives of depressed patients also deviated more from a linear temporal order and compared less frequently the past with the present. Contrary to expectations, the depressed did not differ in the overall frequency of evaluations. However, they used more past than present evaluations and more experience-near evaluations than cognitive evaluations, suggesting that they are more immersed in past experiences. It is concluded that negative bias and depressive explanatory style can be found also in a naturalistic narrative measure, and that depression affects the two major aspects of narrative.

Attitudes were measured by a social distance scale and a question about likely dangerousness. Results: Social distance was unrelated to the hypothesized factors. For schizophrenia (but not depression), belief in dangerousness was predicted by medical illness conceptualizations and genetic causal attribution.

Both educational interventions produced a significant decrease in several stereotype components, which was not the case in the neutral condition. The BG intervention decreased the attribution of blame in both groups. It also decreased the stereotype unpredictability/incompetence and social distance in the medical students but increased the negative outlook on prognosis in the psychology students. The PS intervention reduced the widespread stereotype of dangerousness as well as social distance in the group of medical students.

It has been suggested that patients with persectory delusions excessively attribute hypothetical positive events to internal causes (self) and hypothetical negative events to external personal causes. Despite this, how AT associates with psychotic symptoms (not only persecutory delusions) and how it changes with the resolution of psychosis has never been investigated. We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate how AT is associated with psychopathology and a longitudinal study to,c of AT during the first 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment and the relationship with psychopatholoy examine the change improvement. Methods: 86 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders were included in the cross-sectional study, and 17 patients in the longitudinal study. The longitudinal group were free of antipsychotic drugs at baseline and followed for 6 weeks after being started on antipsychotic medication by their psychiatrist. We Used the Internal. Personal and Situational Attribirtions Questionnaire (IPSAQ) as a measure of AT. Results: Patients that tend to internalize (i.e. less self-serving bias), showed greater overall psychopatholog, as measured by PANSS-Total (F(2,83)-6.59,p = 0.002), with a trend toward significance for PANSS-Positive (F(2,83)= 2.62 p = 0.07). longutudinally, having a low selfserving bias was associated with poorer response to antipsychotic treatment. Further, externalizing bias seems to chan in treatment (F = 9.65 df = 1.15 p = 0.007) and reach ceiling effects thereafter. Conclusions: AT is related to overall symptom severity, with internalizing style linked to higher global psychopathology. Antipsychotic treatment has little effect on AT, at least within 6 weeks of antipsychotic exposure. and only a modest effect is on EB which plateus within 2 weeks. Finally, internalizing style appears associated with poorer response to antipsychotic treatment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

During six hours of class time focused on psychopathology, one class received the experimental pedagogy while the other served as a control, receiving traditional instruction. Stigma was assessed pre- and post-intervention using a social distance scale and vignette design. Statistical analyses compared means and change scores between the two classes. Study 1 results Students in the experimental classroom showed a significant decrease in stigma following the intervention, whereas those in the control group showed no change.

We aimed to explore the mechanism of these associations through qualitative research. Method: We carried out serial in-depth interviews with 42 married women with the complaint of AVD who were purposively selected from a sample of 2494 women recruited into a population-based cohort study in Goa, India. The interviews elicited illness narratives of their complaint, focusing on causal attributions and help-seeking behaviors. Results: Women explicitly link their personal experiences of social adversity and stress (such as marital problems and heavy workloads) with their complaints of AVD. The complaint of tiredness, a core feature of depressive and somatoform disorders, and complaint of ``tension{''} were commonly associated with AVD through bidirectional causal interpretations. Reproductive events, particularly related to the menstrual cycle and contraception, comprise another set of causal attributions. Many women hold multiple causal attributions. Most women sought health care, both biomedical and traditional, and their narratives indicate reinforcement of their causal attributions by health care providers. However, treatments were often discontinued or changed due to lack of symptomatic relief, side effects, or costs. Conclusions: Reproductive health policy and practice must explicitly acknowledge and integrate research findings on psychosocial associations of AVD to promote a holistic and evidence-based approach for this common complaint in women in South Asia.

Thirty-eight relatives of patients with PTSD participating in a treatment trial were assessed on EE, causal attributions for patient problems and nature of attributions. Patients' PTSD symptoms at 6 and 12 months were assessed. Criticism and hostility in relatives were associated with attributing problems to factors controllable by patients.

Understanding the needs and behaviours of this group is important in order to improve patient management. Few studies have investigated the role that patients' perceptions about their mental illness play in guiding coping responses and treatment seeking. The aim of the present study was to investigate how illness perceptions in high users of mental health services were related to unmet needs and treatment-seeking behaviours. Method: A total of 203 high users of mental health services were interviewed using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, the Camberwell Assessment of Need and the Drug Attitude Inventory, and were also asked to report the number of visits they had made to the general practitioner in the past year. District Health Board clinical staff completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need and the Global Assessment of Functioning for each user. Results: More negative perceptions about mental illness were associated with higher ratings of unmet needs by both patients and staff. Negative perceptions were also related to poorer attitudes towards medication, and lower functioning. Perceptions about the personal ability to control the illness were consistently associated with better outcomes. Patients' causal attributions could be categorized as social, psychological, biological and behavioural. More frequent visits to the general practitioner were associated with perceptions of more severe symptoms, greater concern and higher emotional responses to the illness, and psychosocial causal attributions. Conclusion: Illness perceptions provide a framework to assess patients' ideas about severe mental illness and a means by which to identify maladaptive beliefs. Interventions targeted at changing these beliefs may encourage better self-management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1080/00048670701787503,mental health services; mentally ill persons; needs assessment; perception; self-regulation;Mental Health Services;Health Services,,

Sampling and Methods: We conducted representative population surveys with identical sampling procedures and face-to-face interviews in Germany (1990, n = 3,078; 2001, n = 5,025), Novosibirsk (Russia, 2002, n = 745), and Bratislava (Slovakia, 2003, n = 1,000) and a representative telephone survey in Germany in 2006. Results: Two thirds of respondents in Germany endorsed an unconscious conflict as a cause of mental disorder. Endorsement was stronger for depression than for schizophrenia, increased with duration of schooling, and was less prevalent in Bratislava and Novosibirsk and in East compared to West Germany. Endorsement in Germany increased between 1990 and 2001. However, only 5\% of respondents could offer a definition of unconscious conflict that resembled Freud's initial theory. Discussion: The observed West-East gradient is likely to mirror the past political undesirability of psychoanalysis in former communist countries. The popularity of psychoanalytical concepts seems to lag behind their actually declining influence within psychiatry in Germany. Public conception of unconscious conflict however hardly resembles Freud's original ideas. Conclusions: Although psychoanalytical concepts warrant consideration when exploring patients' causal beliefs about mental illness, psychiatrists should focus on the subjective meaning of seemingly psychoanalytic phrases.

For families with multiple cases of bipolar disorder this study explored: attitudes towards childbearing; causal attributions for bipolar disorder, in particular the degree to which a genetic model is endorsed and its impact on the perceived stigma of bipolar disorder; and predictors of psychological distress. Method. Two hundred individuals (95 unaffected and 105 affected with either bipolar disorder, schizo-affective disorder-manic type, or recurrent major disorder) were surveyed, using mailed, self-administered questionnaires. Results. Thirty-five (35\%) participants reported being `not at all willing to have children' or `less willing to have children' as a result of having a strong family history of bipolar disorder. Being not at all or less willing to have children was associated with perceived stigma of bipolar disorder {[}odds ratio (OR) 2.42, p = 0.002], endorsement of a genetic model (OR 1.76, p = 0.046), and being affected (OR 2.16, p = 0.01). Among unaffected participants only, endorsement of a genetic model was strongly correlated with perceived stigma (r(s) = 0.30, p = 0.004). Perceiving the family environment as an important factor in causing bipolar disorder was significantly associated with psychological distress (OR 1.58, p = 0.043) among unaffected participants. Among affected participants, perceived stigma was significantly correlated with psychological distress (OR 2.44, p = 0.02), controlling for severity of symptoms (p < 0.001). Conclusions. Having a genetic explanation for bipolar disorder may exacerbate associative stigma among unaffected members from families with multiple cases of bipolar disorder, while it does not impact on perceived stigma among affected family members. Affected family members may benefit from interventions to ameliorate the adverse effects of perceived stigma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1017/S0033291707000852,Bipolar Disorder;Causality;Attitude,,

Many people affected by mental illness live in developing countries, where treatment and care options are limited. In this context, primary health care (PHC) programs can indirectly promote mental health by addressing its determinants i. e. by enhancing social unity, minimising discrimination and generating income opportunities. The objectives of this study were to: 1. Describe concepts of mental health and beliefs about determinants of mental health and illness among women involved with a PHC project in rural Maharashtra, India; 2. Identify perceived mental health problems in this community, specifically depression, suicide and violence, their perceived causes, and existing and potential community strategies to respond to them and; 3. Investigate the impact of the PHC program on individual and community factors associated with mental health. Method: We undertook qualitative in-depth interviews with 32 women associated with the PHC project regarding: their concepts of mental health and its determinants; suicide, depression and violence; and the perceived impact of the PHC project on the determinants of mental health. The interviews were taped, transcribed, translated and thematically analysed. Results: Mental health and illness were understood by these women to be the product of cultural and socio-economic factors. Mental health was commonly conceptualised as an absence of stress and the commonest stressors were conflict with husbands and mother-in-laws, domestic violence and poverty. Links between empowerment of women through income generation and education, reduction of discrimination based on caste and sex, and promotion of individual and community mental health were recognised. However, mental health problems such as suicide and violence were well-described by participants. Conclusion: While it is essential that affordable, accessible, appropriate treatments and systems of referral and care are available for people with mental illness in developing country settings, the promotion of mental health by addressing its determinants is another potential strategy for reducing the burden of mental illness for individuals and communities in these settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/1471-2458-7-225,Health Promotion;India,,

Such beliefs vary across cultures and, among immigrants, may be influenced by many factors, including level of acculturation, gender, level of education, and experience of illness and treatment. This study examines illness causal beliefs in Turkish-immigrants in Australia. Methods: Causal beliefs about somatic and mental illness were examined in a sample of 444 members of the Turkish population of Melbourne. The socio-demographic characteristics of the sample were broadly similar to those of the Melbourne Turkish community. Five issues were examined: the structure of causal beliefs; the relative frequency of natural, supernatural and metaphysical beliefs; ascription of somatic, mental, or both somatic and mental conditions to the various causes; the correlations of belief types with socio-demographic, modernizing and acculturation variables; and the relationship between causal beliefs and current illness. Results: Principal components analysis revealed two broad factors, accounting for 58 percent of the variation in scores on illness belief scales, distinctly interpretable as natural and supernatural beliefs. Second, beliefs in natural causes were more frequent than beliefs in supernatural causes. Third, some causal beliefs were commonly linked to both somatic and mental conditions while others were regarded as more specific to either somatic or mental disorders. Last, there was a range of correlations between endorsement of belief types and factors defining heterogeneity within the community, including with demographic factors, indicators of modernizing and acculturative processes, and the current presence of illness. Conclusion: Results supported the classification of causal beliefs proposed by Murdock, Wilson \& Frederick, with a division into natural and supernatural causes. While belief in natural causes is more common, belief in supernatural causes persists despite modernizing and acculturative influences. Different types of causal beliefs are held in relation to somatic or mental illness, and a variety of apparently logically incompatible beliefs may be concurrently held. Illness causal beliefs are dynamic and are related to demographic, modernizing, and acculturative factors, and to the current presence of illness. Any assumption of uniformity of illness causal beliefs within a community, even one that is relatively culturally homogeneous, is likely to be misleading. A better understanding of the diversity, and determinants, of illness causal beliefs can be of value in improving our understanding of illness experience, the clinical process, and in developing more effective health services and population health strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/1471-244X-7-34,Causality;Emigrants and Immigrants,,

Methods: Dimensions of lay illness models for depression, schizophrenia, cancer, hypertension and influenza were assessed in 348 people (62.6\% women) aged 13-50 (M = 20.72; S.D. = 5.96) with different personal experience with the studied diseases. Results: Lay illness beliefs are usually close to medical knowledge, but in some relevant cases they are very divergent from this. Experience with the disease (to have suffered from it or to have coexisted with an ill relative) seems to have a great influence in the contents of lay illness models. Conclusion: People's representations on illnesses are not complete or correct at all, and this will have, as the Common Sense Model establishes, relevant repercussions on individuals' behaviors in relation to health and illness and on the outcomes of diseases. Practice implications: To know the personal illness models for physical and mental health threats of healthy and ill people with different personal experience with the disease has important implications for health professionals' promotion and prevention strategies and clinical (treatment/rehabilitation) actuations.

However, research over 40 years shows Irish migrants to have consistent high vulnerability to mental disorders. Only recently have researchers begun to explore the reasons for this morbidity. Taking a previous epidemiological study on depression and Irish migrants as a point of departure, we explored the reasons for this morbidity-we hypothesised that depression may be related to unprepared or spontaneous migration. We report on a qualitative study in order to clarify how, from the migrants perspective, migration might be related to depression. These perspectives were obtained through in-depth interviews with Irish-born migrants aged 18 and over living in London in order to explore psychological distress through a contextualised `insiders' account. The interviews were completed with men and women who experienced depression and others who had not. We found that previous theories on Irish migrant psychiatric disorder such as racial discrimination were not supported by the narratives of Irish migrant experience. For many participants, the origins of distress are located in Ireland or in difficult life events and circumstances without a direct relationship to migration.

From the perspective of cross-cultural psychiatry, one of the most important cultural factors may be differences in the explanatory model of illness. This article examines the relationship of causal beliefs, perceived service accessibility and attitudes towards seeking mental health care. Method: The sample consisted of 1000 immigrant and refugee women from five ethnic minority communities in Toronto, including three Chinese Canadian communities (Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan), Korean Canadians and Vietnamese Canadians. Data were acquired by a self-administered structured questionnaire. Quantitative data were analysed using MANOVA, ANOVA and stepwise multiple regression. Results: The five ethnic minority groups of women differed in their explanatory models about mental illness and distress. In the full model where other variables were controlled for, the most significant factor predicting attitudes towards seeking professional help was perceived access for all groups except the Hong Kong Chinese. In the last group, those subscribing more to a Western stress model of illness had a more positive attitude towards seeking professional help, while those subscribing more to supernatural beliefs had a more negative attitude.

Methods One hundred and thirty child welfare, mental health and court professionals participated in qualitative interviews individually or in groups. Data analyses identified perceived problems in quality and perceived causes of quality problems. Participants in member checking groups were then asked to comment on and further clarify the results. Results The participants reported concerns related to overuse of psychotropic medication, overmedicated children, short inpatient stays, and continuity of psychiatric care. Overuse of psychotropic medications and overmedication were perceived to be driven by short evaluations, liability concerns, short inpatient stays and a lack of clinical feedback to psychiatrists from child welfare partners. Medicaid reimbursement policies were at the heart of several quality concerns. These problems contributed to a distrust of psychiatric practices among child welfare professionals. Conclusions These findings underscore the adverse effects of modern marketplace medicine coupled with low Medicaid reimbursement rates on quality of care for vulnerable groups. Child welfare and mental health professionals and their associated stakeholders may together possess substantial clout to advocate for a reimbursement system and structure that promotes quality service. The findings also point to a crisis of credibility toward psychiatric practice among social service and other non-psychiatrist mental health professionals.

A total of 79 patients searching cognitive-behavioral treatment in an inpatient hospital for psychosomatic disorders participated in the study, Patients reported their spontaneous causal attributions about the bodily symptoms in an interview (KAUSOM), and these attributions were categorized by an independent sample of raters (n = 51). The number and intensity of somatoform symptoms (SOMS), the health anxiety (WI), catastrophizing cognitions (FKG) and depression (BDI) were assessed prior and at the end of treatment. The patients reported more somatic than psychological attributions. Gender, the number of somatoform symptoms as well as depression severity were shown as predictors of the attributional style. Overall, a significant symptom improvement was shown at the end of treatment, but the attributional style did not affect outcome of somatoform symptoms, health anxiety and depression. In line with cognitive-behavioral models of somatoform disorders, the study suggests that patients mainly report somatic attributions.

The purpose of this study was to explore whether explicit and implicit attributional styles of delusional patients were associated to their clinical state, and whether attributions biases are specific to delusional psychopathology or also appear in other disorders (i.e. depression). Design and methods. A cross-sectional design was used. The sample consisted of 136 participants (40 acute deluded participants, 25 remitted deluded participants, 35 depressed patients and 36 normal controls). The Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ) and the Pragmatic Inferential Test (PIT) were used to assess explicit and implicit attributional style, respectively. Results. All participants, with the exception of the depressed patients group, showed an externalizing bias (EB) for negative events. Although both acute and remitted deluded patients showed a similar overall pattern of explicit attributions, the personalizing bias (PB) was significantly greater in the acute group. The magnitude of this bias, which was also found in the depressed patients, was significantly related to the patient's degree of severity, as assessed by the total BPRS score (r =.45, p <.001). The results on the implicit attributions were more equivocal, perhaps due the low reliability of the PIT. Conclusions. Attributional biases seem to be a stable characteristic of delusions. Yet, the PB might be a rather unspecific characteristic that varies with the degree of the severity of psychopathology.

(2) Are perceived causes of mental distress actually related to treatment preferences? (3) Are EMs influenced uniquely by ethnic group, or are they more closely associated with the presence of common mental disorders? Method: From February 2003 to January 2004, we investigated EMs for mental distress among 79 Bangladeshi, 85 black Caribbean, and 97 white British people who reported difficulties in the preceding month. EMs were assessed by a self-report checklist that inquired about the identity, causes, timeline, consequences, controllability, and preferred treatments for mental distress. Common mental disorders were assessed using the Clinical Interview Schedule (revised). Results: Independent of ethnic group, people with common mental disorders were more likely to give spiritual causal explanations (odds ratio {[}OR] = 3.1, 95\% CI = 1.9 to 4.9), to report behavioral (OR = 2.2, 95\% CI = 1.3 to 3.8) and financial consequences (OR = 3.3, 95\% CI = 1.8 to 6), and to prefer complementary treatments (OR = 4.6, 95\% CI = 2.3 to 9.1).

Compared with white British subjects, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean subjects preferred medical and spiritual treatments, whereas white British subjects, as compared with the other 2 ethnic groups, preferred self-management and social treatments.

The aim of this study is to examine why this may be the case. Method: In the spring of 2001, a population survey was carried out among German citizens aged 18 years and older, living in private households. A total of 5025 interviews were conducted, reflecting a response rate of 65.1\%. At the beginning of the personal, fully structured interview, respondents were presented with a vignette containing a diagnostically unlabelled psychiatric case history, either depicting a case of schizophrenia or major depressive disorder. Using five-point Likert scales, causal attributions as well as perceived dangerousness, fear and the desire for social distance were assessed. Results: The more respondents endorse a brain disease as a cause, the more dangerous they believe the person with schizophrenia or major depression to be. Respondents who perceive the individual in the vignette as being dangerous express a higher degree of fear and a greater preference for social distance from these individuals. As compared with brain disease, the relationships between heredity and perceived dangerousness are less pronounced for both disorders. Conclusions: Our analysis showed that endorsing biogenetic explanations decreases the likelihood of social acceptance of people with schizophrenia and major depression. Rejecting behavioural responses in the form of social distance desired from people with schizophrenia and major depression result from cognitive emotional processes in which biogenetic causal attributions are linked to lack of self-control, unpredictability and dangerousness, which, in turn, are associated with fear of these people.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0020764006061246,Mental Disorders;Germany,,

Current classifications mainly focus on the numbers of symptoms, with relative neglect of the underlying psychopathology. Researchers have emphasized the importance of a number of experiential, perceptual and cognitive-behavioural aspects of somatization. This review focuses on existing literature on the role of somatosensory amplification, attribution styles, and illness behaviour in somatization. Evidence suggests that somatosensory amplification is neither sensitive nor specific to somatizing states, and that other factors like anxiety, depression, neuroticism, alexithymia may also have an influence. Attribution research supports the existence of multiple causal attributions, which are related to the numbers of somatic symptoms. While somatizing patients have more organic attributions, depressed patients have more psychological attributions. A global somatic attribution style is associated with the number of obscure somatic symptoms, while a psychological attribution style is associated with both-psychological and somatic- symptoms of depression and anxiety. There are conflicting findings with respect to the role of normalizing attributions in reducing physician recognition of anxiety and depression. Specific symptom attributions appear to explain physician recognition of psychological distress, but global attribution styles do not appear to explain any further variance in physician recognition beyond that explained by specific causal attributions. Illness behaviour has been studied in two distinct ways in literature. Research focusing on attendance rates as a form of illness behaviour suggests that somatization is associated with high levels of health care utilization. There is also some evidence that health care utilization, amplification and attributions styles may be interrelated among somatizing patients. More structured ways to assess illness behaviour have found high levels of abnormal illness behaviour in this population. Overall, research appears to suggest a complex ( and as yet unclear) relationship between somatic symptoms and underlying cognitions/illness behaviours. While it is clear that somatization is closely related to a number of perceptual and cognitive-behavioural factors, the precise nature of these relationships are yet to be elucidated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1080/09540260500466790,"",,

In this article, we review studies of the psychological mechanisms that might be involved in paranoid thinking and discuss their implications for forensic behaviour science. Paranoia has not been consistently associated with any specific neuropsychological abnormality. However, evidence supports three broad types of mechanism that might be involved in delusional thinking in general and paranoia in particular: anomalous perceptual experiences, abnormal reasoning, and motivational factors. There is some evidence that paranoia may be associated with hearing loss, and good evidence that paranoid patients attend excessively to threatening information. Although general reasoning ability seems to be unaffected, there is strong evidence that a jumping-to-conclusions style of reasoning about data is implicated in delusions in general, but less consistent evidence specifically linking paranoia to impaired theory of mind. Finally, there appears to be a strong association between paranoia and negative self-esteem, and some evidence that attempts to protect self-esteem by attributing negative events to external causes are implicated. Some of these processes have recently been implicated in violent behaviour, and they therefore have the potential to explain the apparent association between paranoid delusions and offending.

In this review we present recently published literature on aspects of epidemiology, classification and treatment in this important overlap area. Recent findings From the multitude of papers published annually on the co-occurrence of different pain conditions and depression, temporomandibular dysfunction stands out this year by sheer quantity; it can be seen as a model case of the necessity for differentiated high-quality assessments on the biological as well as the psychosocial level. There is a general move to separate utility of diagnostic classifications from their validity, and this strengthens classificatory approaches that help to view the regular overlap of depression, pain and other somatic symptoms as the rule rather than the exception. The incorporation of cognitive variables like causal attributions should help to distinguish clinically relevant subtypes among overlap cases. The classificatory future of the category of `somatoform disorders' is somewhat in doubt, but reforms seem to be more productive than abolishment. Psychopharmacology provides rather intense recent coverage of the overlap field, with newer dual serotonergic-noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors offering some promise. Summary Treating the overlap of depression, pain and other somatic symptoms as the rule rather than the exception is necessary for adequate aetiological research as well as for diagnosis and treatment, with one-dimensional classificatory and treatment approaches almost certainly being insufficient.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1097/01.yco.0000189880.11059.8d,classification; depression; pain; somatoform disorders; treatment;Somatoform Disorders;Depression,,

In spite of its obvious qualities, there have always been conceptual difficulties with the diagnosis, mainly concerning the crucial A-criterion. The A-criterion of PTSD (i.e. the trauma criterion according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) represents the conceptual core of the diagnosis. It is much owed to social and political stances of its original authors and stipulates a monocausal etiology of the disorder. This is in fact inadequate and misleading. Furthermore, the A-criterion is tautologic and therefore dispensable. It may be more appropriate to define PTSD strictly on the basis of descriptive, phenomenological terms and to omit the A-criterion, in order to avoid useless confusions about causal attribution.

To study the role of self-discrepancies in different phases of bipolar disorder (manic-depression). Method and design. Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in three groups, currently depressed, currently manic or hypomanic, and currently in remission, together with healthy control participants, were administered a modified version of Higgins' Selves Questionnaire. Consistencies between the self-actual, self-ideal and self-ought representations were calculated, together with consistencies between the self-actual representation and the believed views of generalized others about the self. Results. In contrast to all other groups, bipolar depressed patients showed marked discrepancies between their self-actual and self-ideal representations, and between their self-actual and self-ought representations. Manic or hypomanic patients showed higher self-actual:self-ideal consistency than non-patient controls. The differences between the depressed participants and the other groups appeared to be accounted for by their very negative self-actual descriptions. Participants in all four groups showed high levels of consistency between self-perceptions and the believed perceptions of others about the self. Conclusions. These findings confirm that beliefs about the self differ between different phases of bipolar disorder and are consistent with the hypothesis that the manic phase involves active avoidance of discrepancies between the self and self-ideals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1348/014466505X29189,Bipolar Disorder,,

Attributions play an important role in depression and paranoia. However, contrary to most attributional models of psychopathology, there is evidence that attributional style is not a stable trait but is affected by recent experiences. Method. Paranoid, depressed, and healthy participants were exposed to a mild stressor in the form of the requirement to complete an anagram task, which included insoluble items. Before and afterwards, they completed measures of attributional style for negative events and a contingency judgment task. Results. Replicating previous findings, paranoid patients initially showed low internality scores for negative events and high judgments of control on the contingency judgment task, whereas the depressed participants showed high internality for negative events and low judgments of control. Following the anagram task, both clinical groups showed increased internality for hypothetical negative events. The paranoid participants also gave increased estimates of control on the contingency judgment task. Conclusions.

Objective The aim of this study was to determine public opinions and beliefs about the treatment of depression and the influence of perception and causal attributions on attitudes towards treatment of depression in urban areas. Methods This study was carried out with a representative sample in Istanbul, which is the biggest metropolis in Turkey. Seven hundred and seven subjects completed the public survey form which consisted of 32 items rating attitudes towards depression. Results The public believes that psychological and social interventions are more effective than pharmacotherapy, and that the medicines used in treatment of depression are harmful and addictive. There was a general reluctance to consult a physician for depression, and psychiatrists were felt to be more helpful than general practitioners. The public viewed depression as treatable. A high educational level and perceiving depression as a disease is associated with positive beliefs and opinions about the treatment of depression; but the perception of depressive patients as aggressive is associated with negative beliefs and opinions about the treatment of depression. Conclusion The beliefs that `` psychological and social interventions are more effective than pharmacotherapy{''} and `` antidepressants are harmful and addictive{''} must specifically be taken into account in clinical practice and in anti-stigma campaigns. Additional studies are needed to understand the public's tendency to conceptualise depression as a psychosocial problem. In clinical practice, depression should be in troduced as a bio-psychosocial disease whatever its cause: biological, psychological or social.

Although presumed to be caused by reproductive tract infections (RTIs), the association between the complaint and the presence of RTTs is weak. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors of the complaint of vaginal discharge. Methods We conducted a community-based survey of 3000 women aged 18-50 years, randomly sampled from a population in Goa, India. Women who gave informed consent were invited to participate in a structured interview, which elicited data on the primary outcome (the experience of current abnormal vaginal discharge) and psychosocial exposures: gender adversity; symptoms of somatoform disorders; and common mental disorders (CMD). All women were required to provide vaginal and/or urine samples for diagnosis of RTIs using gold standard laboratory tests. Risk factors were analysed using logistic regression with the binary outcome of the complaint of vaginal discharge. Results Of the 2494 women (83\%) who agreed to participate, 14.5\% complained of having an abnormal vaginal discharge. Stress was the most common causal attribution for the complaint. The final multivariate model found that high scores for CMD (OR 2.16, 1.4-3.2) and somatoform disorders (6.23, 4.0-9.7) and the use of an intrauterine contraceptive device (1.86, 1.0-3.4) were independently associated with the complaint. Low literacy (0.54, 0.4-0.8) and age > 40 years (0.29, 0.2-0.4) were associated with a reduced risk. RTI were not associated with the complaint (1.24, 0.9-1.6). Conclusions Psychosocial factors have the strongest association with the complaint of vaginal discharge. Syndromic management algorithms need refinement so that women with complaints that are non-infectious in aetiology are offered psychosocial interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/ije/dyi072,vaginal discharge; India; depression; reproductive tract infections; survey;Risk Factors,,

One difficulty with engaging mothers is that, by definition, PMT is directed at the parent, yet many parents believe the cause of the problem lies within the child. Hence the model of therapy offered contradicts their understanding about the cause and nature of the problem. Moreover, the emotional consequence of holding child-responsibility causal attributions is associated with high expressed emotion (EE), a known predictor of poor compliance with therapy in other child psychiatric disorders. Methods: Seventy-five consecutive referrals of mothers to a PMT programme were recruited. EE was assessed using the Camberwell Family Interview methodology. Spontaneous causal attributions about their child's problem behaviour were collected from the same interview material and independently coded using the Leeds Attributional Coding System. Attendance data at the PMT programme was collected following completion of programmes. Results: Contrary to expectations, mothers who made child-responsibility attributions and were highly critical about their child's behaviour were no more likely than non-blaming, low EE parents to drop out prematurely from a course of PMT. However, expressing an understanding of their own role in managing their child's behaviour was predictive of attendance. Two factors were, however, more closely associated with greater attrition: having been offered a clinical diagnosis and being from a lower socio-economic family. Conclusions: Socio-economic factors should be viewed as barriers to uptake of services and successful strategies for increasing engagement of families are likely to be economical rather than psychological. However, although the causal attributions mothers make about their child's behaviour did not predict whether they were likely to attend PMT, an exploratory analysis found evidence to suggest that successful engagement with PMT begins early in the referral process and that referring clinicians should ensure treatment options are aligned with diagnoses provided.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00365.x,behaviour; parent management training; attribution; expressed emotion; maternal depression,,

Critical rethinking of professional concepts of somati- zation suggests the value of complementary assessment of patients' illness explanatory models of somatoform and other common mental disorders. We undertook this prospective study to assess medically unexplained somatic symptoms and their patient-perceived causes of illness and to show how patients' explanatory models relate to professional diagnoses of common mental disorders and how they may predict the short-term course of illness., Tertiary care patients (N = 186) with prominent somatoform symptoms were evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, a locally adapted Explanatory Model Interview to elicit patients' illness experience (priority symptoms toms) and perceived causes, and clinical self-report questionnaires. The self-report questionnaires were administered at baseline and after 6 months. Diagnostic overlap between somatoform, depressive, and anxiety disorders occurred frequently (79.6\%). Patients explained pure somatoform disorders mainly with organic causal attributions; they explained pure depressive and/or anxiety disorders mainly with psychosocial perceived causes, and patients in the diagnostic overlap group typically reported mixed causal attributions. In this last group, among patients with similar levels of symptom severity, organic perceived causes were related to a lower physical health sum score on the MOS Short Form, and psychosocial perceived causes were related to less severe depressive symptoms, assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 6 months. Among patients meeting criteria for comorbid somatoform with anxiety and/or depressive disorders, complementary assessment of patient-perceived causes, a key element of illness explanatory models, was related to levels of functional impairment and short-term prognosis. For such patients, causal attributions may be particularly useful to clarify clinically significant features of common mental disorders and thereby,contribute to clinical assessment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1097/01.nmd.0000152796.07788.b6,somatization; common mental disorders; explanatory model;Mental Disorders,,

However, there has been little direct cross-cultural comparison. Here we report a comparison of public beliefs about the causes of mental disorders in Japan and Australia. Methods: Surveys of the public were carried out in each country using as similar a methodology as feasible. In both countries, household interviews were carried out concerning beliefs about causes and risk factors in relation to one of four case vignettes, describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia or chronic schizophrenia. In Japan, the survey involved 2000 adults aged between 20 and 69 from 25 regional sites spread across the country. In Australia, the survey involved a national sample of 3998 adults aged 18 years or over. Results: In both countries, both social and personal vulnerability causes were commonly endorsed across all vignettes. The major differences in causal beliefs were that Australians were more likely to believe in infection, allergy and genetics, while Japanese were more likely to endorse ``nervous person{''} and ``weakness of character{''}. For risk factors, Australians tended to believe that women, the young and the poor were more at risk of depression, but these were not seen as higher risk groups by Japanese. Conclusion: In both Japan and Australia, the public has a predominant belief in social causes and risk factors, with personal vulnerability factors also seen as important. However, there are also some major differences between the countries. The belief in weakness of character as a cause, which was stronger in Japan, is of particular concern because it may reduce the likelihood of seeking professional help and support from others.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1186/1471-244X-5-33,Mental Disorders;Australia,,

Rates of anxiety and depressive disorders were compared between 130 RLS patients within this age range and 2265 community respondents from a nationally representative sample with somatic morbidity of other types.

Alms: To examine psychological distress among Kuwaiti women with infertility problems and explore the perceived causes of infertility. Methods: An Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to examine the psychological status of 120 Kuwaiti infertile women and an age-matched sample of 125 healthy pregnant women as a control group. Results: Compared with age-matched pregnant control sample. The infertile women exhibited a significant higher psychopathology in all HADS parameters in the form of tension, hostility, anxiety, depression, self-blame and suicidal ideation. The illiterate group attributed the causes of their infertility to supernatural causes such as evil spirits, witchcraft and God's retribution, while the educated group blamed nutritional, marital and psychosexual factors for their infertility. Faith and traditional healers were considered as the first treatment choice among illiterate women, while the educated women opted for an infertility clinic for treatment. Childlessness results in social stigmatization for infertile women and places them at risk of serious social and emotional consequences. Conclusions: The prevalence and severity of psychological distress in this sample of infertile Kuwaiti women indicates the appropriateness of referring these patients for psychological evaluation. Successful programmes in dealing with infertility in Kuwait need to include the establishment of a community based intervention strategy to educate people about infertility and to give guidelines for treatment options.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1177/0020764004050334,"",,

Seven hundred and seven subjects completed the public survey form which consisted of ten items screening the demographic features and health status of the participants, and 32 items rating attitudes towards depression. Results The respondents' attitudes towards depression were very negative and nearly half of the subjects perceived people with depression as dangerous. More than half of the subjects stated that they would not marry a person with depression, and nearly half of the subjects stated that they would not rent their house to a person with depression. One-quarter of the subjects stated that depressive patients should not be free in the community. The subjects who considered depression as a disease and who believed that weakness of personality and social problems cause depression had negative attitudes towards depression. Conclusions In Istanbul, people recognise depression well, but their attitudes towards it are fairly negative. The urban public has unfavourable attitudes towards depression and a tendency to isolate patients from the society.

Although numerous studies document its impact on patients and their families, health studies of stigma typically regard it in global terms without adequate attention to the conceptual and practical importance of sociocultural contexts and the particular features of illness that evoke stigma. Research at a psychiatric referral center in Bangalore, India, studied the cultural epidemiology of schizophrenia and stigma in interviews with family caretakers of 60 patients, using a locally adapted EMIC inter-view and the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale. An index of 13 stigma queries based on Goffinan's formulation covered relevant aspects and proved to be internally consistent (Cronbach alpha = 0.81). Multivariate statistical regression and qualitative analysis of narratives were used to analyze this stigma index and identify explanatory variables based on cultural patterns of distress (PD), perceived causes (PC), and previous help seeking (HS). Significant variables included suspiciousness and inappropriate sexual behavior (PD), heredity and bad deeds (PC), and informal help seeking (HS). Previous allopathic help seeking was negatively associated with stigma. Analysis of coded text segments from respondent narratives showed how these variables were related to family-perceived stigma, with reference to marriage practices, moral meanings of schizophrenia, and ways in which effective allopathic care minimized stigma. Findings identify features of schizophrenia-related stigma in India, contribute to comparative culture studies, and inform practical approaches to mitigate stigma through community awareness and improved mental health services.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1097/01.nmd.0000144692.24993.1b,schizophrenia; stigma; cultural epidemiology; cultural psychiatry;Schizophrenia;India,,

Public social policies in New Zealand assume that there are fundamental differences between Maori views of health phenomena and non-Maori perceptions. The biomedical model and a Maori model known as Te Whare Tapa Wha are commonly employed to characterise these differences. Using the categorical ethnicity demarcation `Maori/non-Maori' we investigate this claim with respect to mental health literacy about depression. Design. Participants were randomly selected from the General and Maori Electoral Rolls and recruited by post (N=205). A vignette methodology was employed and involved the development of a fictional character as a target stimulus who exhibited the minimum DSM-IV-R criteria for a major depressive disorder. Participants responded to items regarding problem recognition, well-being, causal attributions, treatment preferences, and likely prognosis. Results. The majority of Maori and non-Maori participants correctly identified the problem the vignette character was experiencing and nominated congruent attributions for the causes of the problem. In relation to treatment strategies and likely prognosis, independent of self-assigned ethnicity, participants rated professional treatments above alternative options. Overall the categorical ethnicity distinction `Maori and non-Maori' produced no systematic variation with regards to individual evaluative responses about a major depressive disorder. Conclusions. Contrary to the embedded assumption within New Zealand's public health strategies that there are essential differences between the way Maori and non-Maori view health problems, and that the categorical ethnicity demarcation reliably reflects these differences, we found no evidence for the veracity of this claim using a major depressive disorder as a target for judgements.

The biological causes ('brain disease' and `heredity') were less frequently selected for depression than for schizophrenia. Irrespective of place and type of mental disorder, endorsing biological factors as the cause of schizophrenia was associated with a greater desire for social distance, the same relationship applies to depression in half the instances.

It considers all published studies that have assessed the attributions of high- and low-EE relatives and carers. Across these studies, a great deal of consistency is apparent. Critical relatives are more likely to hold patients responsible for their difficulties. On the other hand, attributions made by emotionally overinvolved relatives are similar to the attributions made by those who are low EE. In reviewing the association between attributions and patient relapse, it is concluded that carers' beliefs may play a role in the relapse process in a variety of ways. These include mediating controlling behavior, which may serve to increase patient stress or decrease patients' sense of self-worth. A major limitation of research in this area is the cross-sectional and correlational nature of the data. This makes it impossible to draw conclusions about directions of effect in the association of EE and attributions. Nonetheless, an argument can be made for the development and evaluation of interventions designed to help relatives adopt less blaming and more flexible beliefs about the nature of patients' problems. Particularly helpful in this regard may be interventions that use verbal and behavioral reattribution techniques similar to those described in the cognitive behavioral treatment of emotional disorders.

The objective of the study described in this paper was to use qualitative methods to investigate the cultural validity of the construct of postnatal depression (PND) and its social and cultural contexts. The study was nested in a cohort of mothers recruited to study the risk factors and outcome of PND in Goa, India. In-depth interviews were carried out with 39 mothers (19 of whom were found to be suffering from PND as defined by a cut-off score on the Edinburgh PND scale) and their husbands purposively recruited from the cohort. An illness narrative was conducted with mothers who were categorized as suffering from PND and their husbands to elicit their explanatory models. The two groups (PND and non-PND) of mothers were comparable in terms of socio-demographic characteristics. PND mothers had lower levels of practical help and emotional support. The symptoms reported by PND mothers were similar to those recorded in studies with women in other cultures suggesting a universal clinical presentation of PND. Causal attributions for the experience of depression focused on economic difficulties and poor marital relationship. All mothers expressed the need for more practical help and support during the period after childbirth; husbands in both groups were often disengaged from baby care or supporting the mother. The study provides validity for the construct of PND in an Indian setting, but also shows that the emotional distress is interpreted from the context of social adversity, poor marital relationships and cultural attitudes towards gender rather than a biomedical psychiatric category. Contrary to the assumption that sociocultural contexts associated with childbirth in non-Western societies protect mothers from depression, factors unique to the culture such as gender preference and the low involvement of husbands in child-care are major causes of stress to mothers.

The attributions are shaped primarily by psychosocial ideas about aetiology. Nevertheless, one-third of the interviewees holds biological or disease-related beliefs about causes of depression. The respective illness models cannot be neglected in the therapeutic relationship.","2nd International Zurich Conference on Clinical and Social Psychiatry, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND, SEP 06-08, 2001 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1034/j.1600-0447.108.s418.19.x,cause; depression; demographic; lay belief; mental disorder,,

The aim of the study was to investigate how the psychiatric label `borderline personality disorder' (BPD) affected staffs perceptions and causal attributions about patients' behaviour. Methods and design. The study utilized a within-participants questionnaire methodology and participants comprised qualified mental health nursing staff. The questionnaire contained descriptions of challenging behaviour in which the patient was described with a diagnosis of depression, schizophrenia or BPD. Participants were asked to identify a likely cause of the behaviour and then on a Likert-type scale rate attributions of internality, stability, globality and controllability. In addition they recorded their level of sympathy with the patient and their optimism for change. Results. Patients with a label of BPD attracted more negative responses from staff than those with a label of schizophrenia or depression. Causes of their negative behaviour were rated as more stable and they were thought to be more in control of the causes of the behaviour and the behaviour itself. Staff reported less sympathy and optimism towards patients with a diagnosis of BPD and rated their personal experiences as more negative than their experiences of working with patients with a diagnosis of depression or schizophrenia. Conclusions. Staff regard patients with a BPD label to be more in control of negative behaviour than patients with a label of schizophrenia or depression. In accord with Weiner's (1985) model, attributions of control were inversely related to staff sympathy. Addressing attributions of control may provide a means to modify staff sympathy towards patients with a diagnosis of BPD and counteract their negative experiences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1348/01446650360703366,Borderline Personality Disorder,,

Using survey data containing responses to hypothetical vignettes, we examine these relationships in a sample of 518 community college students. Consistent with attribution theory, causal attributions affect beliefs about persons' responsibility for causing their condition, beliefs which in turn lead to affective reactions, resulting in rejecting responses such as avoidance, coercion, segregation, and withholding help. However consistent with a danger appraisal hypothesis, the effects of perceptions of dangerousness on helping and rejecting responses are unmediated by responsibility beliefs. Much of the dangerousness effects operate by increasing fear a particularly strong predictor of support for coercive treatment. The results from this study also suggest that familiarity with mental illness reduces discriminatory responses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Aqsa""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.2307/1519806,Mentally Ill Persons;Discrimination (Psychology),,

Methods: Analysis of consistency, correlation with the test for locus of control in health and illness (KKG-Test), scale intercorrelation, correlation with the Frankfurt Self-Concept Scales, therapy cooperation and prognosis. Results: The SPPJ distinguishes between causal attributions and locus of control and proves to be a reliable measuring instrument that delivers satisfactory correlations to the statement of general measuring instruments (KKG-Test). Contrary to our expectations there is no significant positive correlation between internal locus of control and cooperation and prognosis. An external, powerful-others causal attribution has a negative effect upon cooperation,,while an external powerful-others locus of control has a positive effect upon it. Conclusions: Adolescent self-assessment of mental problems is a defined research subject different from illness or health concept variables in adults or concerning bodily illness. Adolescents who are less inclined to blame others for their problem and who value professional competence are probably more accepting of interventions and more compliant. Further research in this area is necessary.

Persecutory delusions appear to involve abnormal attentional biases to threat-related information, particularly information related to the self. The present study aimed to investigate attentional biases to different types of perceived threat and changes in self-perception in response to exposure to such threat-related material. Method. Discrepancies between actual self, ideal self and perceived others' self-representations were assessed in three groups of participants; 13 people experiencing persecutory delusions, 11 people in a psychiatric comparison group, and 13 in a nonpsychiatric comparison group. An adaptation of the emotional Stroop task was then used as an experimental manipulation of attentional bias to five different types of threat (sociotropic, autonomic, physical, ego threats from others, and self-directed ego threats). Self-discrepancies were then again assessed. Results. Before administration of the emotional Stroop task, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of their self-actual:self-ideal and self-actual:other-actual discrepancies. However, after the administration of the Stroop task, significant differences between the clinical groups were observed, mirroring significant reductions in self-actual:self-ideal discrepancies and significant increases in self-actual:other-actual discrepancies in the paranoid participants. Conclusions. This paper is novel in repeating the assessment of self-discrepancies after the processing of threat-related information. These findings are consistent with Bentall, Kinderman, and Kaney's (1994) model of paranoid ideation and findings reported by Kinderman and Bentall (2000).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1348/014466503762841977,Delusions;Bias (Epidemiology),,

The specific beliefs about mental illness that have been assessed have been varied and largely without a common theoretical framework. This has resulted in a literature from which it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. The central aim of this paper is to assess the applicability of the SRM to mental illness. To this end, we review studies to date that have examined the beliefs that people with a mental illness have about their experiences. In addition, we review studies that have examined the beliefs of relatives of people with a mental illness and professionals who work with this population. We assess to what extent these studies are consistent with the SRM before suggesting ways in which the model could be further developed and tested. The SRM is presented as a useful framework for more advanced investigations into the function of beliefs about mental illness and how these can be modified in order to effect outcome.

Self-report measures of child problem behaviour and maternal depressive symptoms were also completed. Results: Consistent with previous research, high EE mothers, compared to low EE mothers, were more likely to make attributions that judged the cause of problem behaviour to be personal to and controllable by the child and also made more `child-blaming' attributions than low EE mothers. Mothers' scores on the Beck Depression Inventory were found to be associated with `child-blaming' attributions and higher levels of EE. Regression analyses did not support the hypothesised role of attributions as a mediator between depression and EE but did identify EE as a potential mediator in the relationship between maternal depressed mood and ratings of child problem behaviour.

Investigations about motivation also stimulate many scientists and constitute another foundation of this study (13). The level of performance depends on knowledge and motivation (33). Time devoted to study is essential to succeed; so motivation and procrastination are in competition. The importance of reinforcement (extrinsical motivation) and the desire for learning and knowing (intrinsical motivation) are determinant Other elements must be emphasized: guarantee of obtaining rewards, self efficacy and causal attribution. These considerations point out the multidimensional and interactive aspects of test anxiety (7,31). The number of components is not described unanimously but experts agree with emotional, cognitive and behavioral dimensions (25). So, anxiety was approached in its motivational properties, and it was the case until the sixties, in terms of drive corresponding to a need like thirst or hunger (18); then it was conceptualized in a dynamic context broader than that of stress and coping (29,30). Last, it constitutes the object of theories highlighting cognitive interference (9,23,26) or defective skills (8,32). A lot of questionnaires were built without answering the different aspects and for instance without linking the theoretical and therapeutic components concerning this problem. Committed to the traditional fields of research (test anxiety and need of achievement), to Weiner's work about attribution theory (34) and that of Bandura in self efficacy (4,5), E Depreeuw (10) was particularly interested in Heckhausen's model (16,17), trying to associate experimental conceptions with the clinical reality. On this basis, he elaborated the TASTE (10,12,20): test for ability to study and evaluation. At first constituted of 121 items, the self-questionnaire, after factorial analysis, was reduced to 78 items assessing 4 factors which represent the 8 components of Heckhausen's model (16). The first factor (30 items) concerns anxiety in its emotional and cognitive characteristics. Interesting data were observed by Depreeuw and confirmed in the Netherlands and in Greece (19), especially the fact that anxiety of girls is higher than that of boys when they are confronted with an exam. The second one (19 items) represents self-confidence : confidence in ability to succeed and on using adequate strategies. The third factor (14 items) squared withvalue attributed to performance. It especially comments on the intrinsical component of motivation, The fourth factor (15 items) corresponds to procrastination; study is postponed on behalf of activities which actually reduce the achievement process. The self-report questionnaire (where answers run from total disagreement to total agreement whether they correspond to the way of thinking or acting) takes account of the emotional, cognitive and behavioral dimensions of the model, The multidimensional aspect of this questionnaire, but mainly its connections with theory and clinic, are convincing; we adopted it with other tests in research about fear of failure. Validation of the French translation is the subject of this article. In order to realize this operation, we chose the initial version of TASTE (121 items) to assess a Belgian sample of french speaking students in the first year of University of Liege (n = 617). They are differenciated by gender, faculty (Economy, Medecine, Philosophy, Psychology, Applied Sciences) and experience of failure, i.e. the fact of repeating a school year. Statistics were realized with SPSS and SAS. A comprehension test and a back translation are satisfactory. The stability over time too: the one week test-retest was achieved with a sample of 33 student nurses; comparing the factors two by two, intra-class correlations ranged from 0,5 to 0,95. The component analysis with Varimax rotation does not allow us to find the four factors of construction. We obtain the same disappointing results with the version of 78 items. According to the screentest, we adopted the solution of five factors which confirms the original construction. A fifth particularly strong factor (Cronbach's alpha 0,82) corresponds to devalonsation. The intemal reliability is very satisfactory. If we consider the items strong loading (more than 0,30), the French version is constituted of 94 items. If we consider the items which are specifically loading each factor, we can reduce the questionnaire to 50 items. Internal reliability remains the same, Correlations between the data obtained with this brief version are satisfactory; comparing the factors in pairs. Pearson's coefficients range from 0,8 to 0,89. The study of E Depreeuw was realized ten years ago with a Belgian sample of Flemish-speaking students; is the cultural context or an evolution in test anxiety which explains such a difference in the results ? We are now assessing a sample in another country which used the TASTE in 1996 in order to have some information about comparison of samples. In any case, the questionnaire of E. Depreeuw respects the multidimensional aspect of test anxiety. Our choice of 5 factors according to principal components confirms the original structure of the test but also discriminates another factor which could be predictive of psychopathology (panic, depression). This new dimension measures negative perception of ability and achievement especially when compared with other students. One aim of such a study is to discern clusters of students i.e. groups of students with characteristics such as Covington (7), Depreeuw (20) and Zeidner (35) describe them. This description is very important; the French version is only a part of a very broader study including other tests and could differenciate student's profiles. The French version of 5 factors finally gives results in agreement with the original. The items (10 per factor) are selected according to their highest specificity and after elimination of redundancy. Validity remains in the short version, making it more useful in clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",,ability to study; devalonsation; failure; internal reliability; sexe; stability overtime; test-anxiety; validation,,

Such beliefs have been identified as key factors in models of health and illness behaviour, and may therefore indirectly influence clinical outcome. In addition, the increasing move towards patient-centred health care suggests that such beliefs need to be identified if a patient's perspective of his or her illness is to be addressed in the care process, Past research on health beliefs surrounding depression have concentrated on identifying ``explanatory models{''} among the general community or among people who already have an established diagnosis of depression. This paper describes the content and status of health beliefs among people who are in the process of receiving a diagnosis. In-depth interviews were carried out with new referrals to a community mental health team (CMHT). Individuals expressed a variety of perceived causes throughout the interview. Beliefs were therefore characterised as changeable. It is argued that the concept of an ``explanatory model{''} is too fixed to fully convey the fluid status of beliefs among this patient group. The concept of an ``exploratory map{''} is suggested as a replacement. Such maps outline the avenues of thought which individuals explored when attempting to understand why they were currently experiencing particular psychological problems. The strength and persistence of beliefs is discussed in relation to both theoretical and clinical implications. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Indian families have been typically described as often believing in causes like supernatural forces and therefore seeking help from magico-religious healers. In the changing mental health scenario in India, this impression needs verification. Method: Key relatives living with 254 chronic schizophrenia patients were interviewed and asked to name the causes they believed were behind the illness. A list of possible causes was provided for the families to select from, and relatives were also encouraged to mention other possible causes, not featured in the list. The possible causes identified and the factors related to attributions made were analysed. Results: A supernatural cause was named by only 12\% of the families and as the only cause by 5\%. Psychosocial stress was most commonly cited cause, followed by personality defect and heredity. A small number of families (14\%) could not name any cause and 39\% named more than one cause. Patient gender and education, duration of illness and the key relative's education and the nature of relationship were related to the type of causal attributions made. Conclusion: Families living with patients suffering chronic schizophrenia receiving treatment in urban India rarely subscribe to the idea of supernatural causation of the illness. The causal attributions made by them are fairly rational and understandable, given the relative lack of exposure to proper information about the illness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s001270050302,Schizophrenia;Causality,,

The sample was formed by 201 alcoholics who were assessed at their centres and groups on two occasions: while they were in treatment and 6 months later. Measurements. During treatment, participants completed several questionnaires related to cognitive and behavioural variables. Drinking problem and background variables were also assessed. Six months later their drinking status and treatment attendance were examined. Findings. Multivariate tests showed that self-efficacy expectancy and long previous time in abstinence independently discriminated alcoholics who maintained abstinence from those who did not. Other cognitive-behavioural variables showed bivariate association with abstinence, but did not add predictive power to these two measures. Conclusions. The results of this study are consistent with the extensive literature that confirms the predictor power of self-efficacy. Unexpectedly, it did not find independent positive relationships between other psychological variables and abstinence. Given that self-efficacy can predict outcome in the medium term, it is suggested that treatment could target this variable.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",10.1046/j.1360-0443.2001.96229713.x,Alcoholics,,

Twenty staff members were assessed for expressed emotion (EE) using the Camberwell Family Interview (CFI) in regard to a client for whom they were a designated key worker. Their spontaneous attributions for the patient's problems were also assessed, along with self-report staff and patient ratings of their expressed and perceived feelings and thoughts about their staff or patient counterpart. The study found that although none of the staff were rated as fulfilling criteria for high EE, there was evidence of some variability in the quality of staff-patient relationships as assessed from the subjective self-report scales of staff and patients. Patients seemed to be sensitive to staff feelings for them: patient ratings of perceived feelings and thoughts from staff were significantly correlated with staff expressed feelings both from the CFI EE ratings and the direct self-report staff measures. Staff tended to view the behaviors of patients they felt less positively disposed toward as more controllable, and this association between less benign explanations of behavior and a more critical attitude is consistent with the attribution research for familial caregivers. The more negatively perceived patient group was found to be more likely to have behavioral disturbances in the 7 months after the relationship ratings were made.

It was hypothesised that there is a meaningful and statistical relationship between these variables and that there will be a difference in this relationship between Asians and Westerners. Participants were 287 adults belonging to three groups (British Asian, western European and Pakistanis). Method: Participants completed two questionnaires: the Orientations to Seeking Professional Help (Fischer and Turner 1970) and the Mental Distress Explanatory Model Questionnaire (Eisenbruch 1990) and a demographic data sheet. Results: Analysis indicated that positive attitudes toward seeking professional help for psychological distress were similar for British Asians, Westerners and Pakistanis. There were significant differences between the three groups in the causal attributions of mental distress. Although culture, as a variable, was not a significant predictor of a positive attitude to seeking professional help, causal beliefs of mental distress were significant predictors of attitudes to seeking help for the British Asian and the Pakistani groups. Beliefs were not significant predictors for attitudes to seeking help for the Western group. Conclusion: It was concluded that culturally determined causal beliefs of mental distress contribute to attitudes towards seeking professional help for psychological problems for Asians.

Cognitive theorists, such as Teasdale and Nolen-Hoeksema, focus on how a reciprocal relationship between depressed mood and the individual's processing of; and response to, their symptoms maintains and prolongs the duration of depressive episodes. interpersonal theorists, such as Lewinsohn and Coyne, hypothpsize that the depressed person's interpersonal behavior elicits negative reactions from the social environment, leading to a downward spiral of persistent depression. Finally, recent studies have indicated that individuals who experienced childhood adversity are more susceptible to a chronic course of depression. Although these three perspectives vary somewhat in the degree of support they have accumulated each exhibits some promise for helping to elucidate the maintenance and persistence of depression. However, much of the available empirical literature suffers from a number of critical limitations, including the lack of clinical samples, longitudinal studies, and adequate attention to confounding variables, such as the severity and duration of depression at baseline and comorbid psychopathology.

Some researchers argue that counterfactual thinking is the key to causal judgments; current research suggests, however, that the relation is rather complex. When people think about counterfactuals, they focus on ways to prevent bad or uncommon outcomes; when people think about causes, they focus on things that covary with outcomes. Counterfactual thinking may affect causality judgments by changing beliefs about the probabilities of possible alternatives to what actually happened, thereby changing beliefs as to whether a cause and effect actually covary.

In all, 2118 personal, fully structured interviews resulted in the West, 980 in the East. Results: In general, there were more similarities than differences between West and East, particularly as concerns causal attributions (with psychosocial stress being most frequently seen as etiologically relevant) and treatment recommendations (with psychotherapy clearly favored over drug treatment). However, there were also some differences, most notably a stronger tendency in the West to define depressive behavior in psychiatric terms and to recommend established forms of psychiatric treatment for its management.

Their conditions are ambiguous and so their expectations for treatment and recovery are uncertain. Their symptoms may be attributed by clinicians to psychological traits or conflicts, and the reality and legitimacy of their suffering and disability may be challenged. To maintain medical attention and support, and legitimate their distress, patients must be skilled in rhetoric. Rhetorical practices shape the presentation of somatic symptoms in primary care, specialty medicine, and psychiatry. Beyond this clinical context, somatic symptoms may have rhetorical value as: (1) an index of disease or disorder; (2) an indication of psychopathology; (3) a symbolic expression of intrapsychic or interpersonal conflict; (4) a culturally coded ``idiom of distress{''}; (5) a metaphor for experience; (6) a strategy for expressing social discontent; and (7) a mechanism through which people attempt to reposition themselves in their local worlds. The clinical treatment of somatoform disorders, as well as the responses of the disability and compensation systems, can be analyzed in terms of their influence on these different levels of meaning. Analysis of the rhetorical power of institutional practices to transform the meaning of somatic distress can guide the development of new clinical and social strategies to help individuals with medically unexplained somatic distress.","3rd Symposium of the Keio University International Symposia for Life Sciences and Medicine on Rethinking Somatoform Disorders, KEIO UNIV, TOKYO, JAPAN, FEB, 1998 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Aqsa""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong publication type",,somatization; discourse; causal attribution; culture; treatment;Somatoform Disorders,,

The qualitative methods consisted of personal interviews and a focus group, the quantitative method of Trochim's concept mapping. The combined approach was adopted in the wake of skepticism about the ability of research instruments developed in the West to study Western populations to provide valid and reliable assessments of non-Western groups. A culturally sensitive definition of the construct was sought as a first step in the design of a culturally sensitive research instrument for a study of divorce among Israeli Arabs to be carried out by a number of Arab and Jewish scholars in Israel. The findings support the authors' initial intuition that the reasons that lead Israeli Arab women to divorce are different from those that motivate middle class Western women. While the latter tend to be motivated by emotional reasons,from poor communication and desire for self-fulfillment, the Muslim Arab women who divorce are moved by really extreme marital misery brought on by a high degree of physical violence, sexual torment, emotional abuse, and/or the mental illness or addiction of their partners, as well as by the active intervention of their in-laws to break up their marriage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Kelly""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",,Arabs,,

Parental self-efficacy beliefs embody an estimation of the degree to which parents perceive themselves as capable of performing the varied tasks associated with this highly demanding role. The overall objective of this review is to synthesize the extant findings related to parental self-efficacy in order to shed light on the importance of the construct for both theoretical and applied purposes. A foundation in self-efficacy theory and general self-efficacy research is offered initially, followed by an exploration of the empirical findings relevant to parenting self-efficacy. Mechanisms through which self-efficacy beliefs are likely to develop and influence parenting are subsequently described.

In a pre-post design, 77 adult inpatients from an acute epilepsy clinic were examined. The treatment goal was to improve antiepileptic drug therapy. Newly developed questionnaires were used to look at epilepsy-specific control-beliefs and preattributions. Depression was measured with the German depression scale D-S' by von Zerssen. Additional data were gathered from the medical files and by direct patient questioning. Data were analyzed by bivariate methods and multiple stepwise regression analyses. As a result of cross-sectional analyses, helplessness measures correlated with depression. Subjects' mean depression scores were slightly higher than the norm. However, analyses of the pre-post relations cast doubt on the expected etiologic influence of control and attribution variables. T2-depression was better predicted by the result of antiepileptic treatment and by T1-depression. Thus, the findings only partially uphold helplessness theory as the explanation for depression in epilepsy. On the whole, they are seen as compatible with coping concepts that stress feedback processes between disease-specific stressors, individual appraisal of these stressors, and emotions.

In a convenience sample of 137 Inuit adults, respondents were randomly presented with one of six different vignettes that described a man with `'strange'' behavior who was either threatening or withdrawn and whose problem was labeled either `'isumaluttuq'' (''burdened or weighed down by thoughts''), `'demon possession,'' or `'mental illness.'' Respondents rated their willingness to live, work, or hunt with this person and allow him into their family on a social distance scale. Significant predictors of greater social distance were female gender, more education, less familiarity with the behavior, and perception of the person as less Likely to recover. There were no significant effects of vignette behavior or label on social distance ratings. Rating of likelihood of recovery was influenced by the vignette label, with isumaluttuq associated with less chance of recovery. Ascribing strange behavior to morally wrong action and to spirits or demons were highly intercorrelated and each was associated with perception of greater Likelihood of recovery. Results suggest that Inuit attitudes toward deviant behavior are influenced more by perceived familiarity and likelihood of recovery than by labels, causal attributions, or explanations.

Cultural variations in symptom attribution affect the pathogenesis, course, clinical presentation and outcome of psychiatric disorders. Research suggests that styles of attribution for common somatic symptoms may influence patients' tendency to somatize or psychologize psychiatric disorders in primary care. At the same time, symptom attributions are used to negotiate the sociomoral implications of illness. Recent work in social psychology and medical anthropology emphasizes the roots of attributional processes in bodily and social processes that are highly context-dependent, and hence, must be understood as part of the construction of a local world of meaning.

Issues related to the International Pilot Studies of Schizophrenia, the expressed emotion studies conducted by the British Medical Research Council's Social Psychiatry Unit, treatment perspectives, and deinstitutionalization are examined. The review indicates that societies believing in an external locus of control for mental illness subscribe to a disease model, view the afflicted individual as sick rather than as an agent of his or her own disability, apply realistic expectancy levels to functioning and productivity of the patient, and show more benign family relationships and lower rates of hospitalization. Societies that stress mutual interdependence rather than independent functioning provide a more salutary climate for the severely disabled.

Over 700 adults answered a questionnaire about their perceptions and explanations of the disease. The majority of respondents identified cancer as the most fearful disease. Women were more frightened of cancer than were men, whereas men were more frightened of heart disease than were women. The greatest fear of cancer was its perceived incurability and the associated suffering, whereas the greatest fear of heart disease was perceived susceptibility. Men were more likely than women to hold a more negative attitude toward cancer information. Factor analysis of the perceived causes of cancer identified four causal factors, which were labelled Stress, Environmental, Health-related, and Behavioural. Men were more likely to identify behavioural items as important whereas women were more likely to rate heredity as important. Fear of cancer was highly correlated with the health beliefs but not with the perceived causes of cancer. However, a regression analysis found that these health beliefs explained only a small proportion of the variance in cancer fear.

Psychological symptoms are common and continue for many years after sexual assault; these symptoms include anxiety, depression, and lowered sexual functioning and satisfaction. The authors then focus on psychological models and constructs of the aftereffects of rape, such as the PTSD construct, and examine theoretical explanations for the creation of PTSD symptoms. Common themes and limitations of current models are discussed.

In addition, client evaluations were thought to be related to therapists' attributions for cause. Experienced psychotherapists (N = 250) evaluated the mental health of a client presented in one of eight case studies, in which client outcome and locus of control for cause of outcome were varied. No differences in attributional style were found between psychodynamic and cognitive-behavior therapists.

As a site of colonialization, the Cape Colony therefore provides fertile ground for the discussion of psychiatric ideas about intersections between 'race' and 'insanity.' Causes of mental disorder as a discourse on besieged colonials and their confrontation with Black Otherness can be traced in the etiological categories used in Cape asylum statistical tables during the period 1891–1909, and also in attributions of causes commonly ascribed to White and Black patients. This article compares perceived causes of mental disorder in White and Black lunatics, drawing on the statistical tables of the Valkenberg and Fort Beaufort Asylums.

The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the factors that may contribute to the reported underuse of professional mental-health services by this group of immigrants. Data were gathered in two stages. First, a questionnaire using a vignette format, a questionnaire on general conceptions of mental illness, and a demographic questionnaire were administered to 222 Soviet Jewish immigrants residing in Los Angeles, California and Houston, Texas, to assess participants' causal attributions, the perceived helpfulness of various types of assistance and assistance providers, and general conceptions of mental illness, and to elicit some demographic information. The second stage included 12 semi-structured interviews with Soviet immigrants to further explore the subjects of the study. The results indicated that Soviet Jewish immigrants attribute mental illness mainly to social causes related to the changes in life situation and to social and environmental pressures. Causal attributions of mental illness were the most significant predictors of corresponding types of mental-health attitudes of the participants in this study. Participants' choices of mental-health assistance for themselves were significantly different from their preferences for psychological types of assistance for others. Participants placed their primary reliance on self or family and friends where mental problems are concerned. The belief that mental health is maintained by the avoidance of morbid thoughts was related to the notion of the importance of self-help. There were no significant gender differences found in the participants' responses.

Furthermore, it was hypothesized that perception of psychological health would be affected by the causal attribution processes explicated in Deaux's model. The experimental manipulation was vignettes that described male, female, and sex unspecified actors with psychopathological behaviors that were male linked (associated with males), female linked (associated with females), and gender neutral (associated equally with males and females). Participants assumed the role of a counselor, and evaluated the psychological health of actors, using the Psychological Health Scale, an instrument derived from the Health Sickness Rating Scale (Luborsky 1962, 1975). Participants also rated the cause of the dysfunctional behaviors on locus of causality (dispositional-situational), and stability (stable-unstable) dimensions, using two subscales of the Causal Dimension Scale (Russell, 1982). For the hypotheses to be supported, an interaction between gender linkage of the psychopathological behaviors and sex of the actor would have to be obtained. However, statistical analyses did not reveal an interaction, therefore the hypotheses were not supported.

Ss' attributions differed with age, gender, education level, and type of disorder (e.g., somatoform, depressive, eating disorders). Therapists judged the relationship with their patients as better with Ss who were more likely to favor intrapsychic and less likely to favor somatic causes.

It is possible that experiencing sexual abuse adversely effects important areas of children's functioning which contribute to the development of psychopathology later in life. The purpose of this study is to examine four areas of children's functioning, including coping, perceptions of helplessness, emotion regulation, and self-concept, in a group of twenty-two sexually abused, twenty-five psychiatric control, and twenty-seven normal control females between the ages of 6 and 12. Using teacher report (The Child Behavior Checklist: Teacher Rating Form), results replicated previous findings of parental reports which indicate that sexually abused children are perceived as experiencing more psychological difficulties than a normal population but fewer difficulties than those manifested by nonsexually abused child psychiatric outpatient populations. Furthermore, results from a projective measure, designed to indirectly assess trauma-related schemas, revealed that compared to a normal control group, sexually abused females have significantly more negative perceptions of themselves and others. Although sexually abused children also demonstrated more negative self concept on a self-report measure (the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale), these differences were not statistically significant. No significant differences between groups were found in regard to coping skills, as assessed by the Coping Scale for Children and Youth, or learned helplessness, as assessed by the Causal Attribution Measure. Significant differences were found in emotion regulation skills, as assessed by the Emotion Regulation Q-sort. However, results were against this study's predictions. The psychiatric control group demonstrated significantly more impaired emotion regulation skills when compared to the sexually abused children. The fact that sexually abused children demonstrate more negative perceptions of themselves and others has long-term implications for their development of appropriate interpersonal relationships, and their ability to utilize support networks during times of distress.

This dissertation examines the experience and diagnosis of mental disorders for the Tzeltal Maya of Chiapas, Mexico. The methods employed include focused ethnoepidemiology survey, folk medical explanatory model survey, and recruitment of self-identified cases of recognized folk disorders--to provide a study population of cases for the administration of life history interviews, folk explanatory model questionnaire for the history of current condition, and video taping of interviews. The data reported on here reflect the self-diagnosed and reported health status of 1986 living individuals from 306 households in the Tzeltal Maya municipality of Tenejapa. Of those interviewed, approximately 100 individuals reported some illness, with 34 individuals reporting current or previous mental illness: 20 report chawaj, 5 report suffering from jowiel, 7 from tup' tup' ik', and 2 recount suffering from some other mental illness. The 'other' mental illnesses are headaches, sometimes classified as mental illness. Of the 33 individuals suffering from some type of mental illness, 21 females and 12 males comprise the population, or two-thirds women and one-third men. They range in age from an infant of 5 months old to a couple of elderly men of approximately 80 years old, males from 5 months to 82 years and women from 7 to 72 years of age. The indigenous taxomonic criteria for a differential diagnosis appears to be based on similarity of symptoms and distinguished through severity of expressed behavior over time. Of the three, tup' tup' ik' is the condition with the clearest biomedical concordance and the most treatable and avoidable Sufferers accounts of their experiences with these health conditions underscore the role of culture in the self-perceived cause and expression of illness.

Within the depression research literature, one of the theoretical frameworks which has been proposed for conceptualizing the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of depression is the 'learned helplessness' model (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) and its reformulated 'hopelessness' model (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989; Alloy, Abramson, Metalsky, & Hartlage, 1988). The recent revisions of this model propose a diathesis-stress interaction in which individuals who engage in depressogenic causal attributions and make negative inferences about themselves and outcomes in response to stressful life events are predisposed to developing 'hopelessness depression' (Abramson et al., 1989). The present study examined how African-American and Anglo-American college students demonstrated differences in hopelessness responses to negative feedback in achievement-skills and social-skills related tasks. In addition, the extent to which group differences in hopelessness responding could be accounted for by personality and contextual variables that differed significantly between ethnic groups was assessed. Contrary to predictions, findings revealed that African-Americans demonstrated less hopelessness (i.e., less decrease in task self-efficacy) for the achievement-skills task than did Anglo-Americans. However, contextual and personality variables measured in this study did not account for the group differences. Possible explanations for these findings and implications for future research are discussed.

This paper reviews research addressing 3 domains of staff beliefs: definitions of challenging behavior, causal attributions, and beliefs about appropriate intervention. In general, staff definitions were found to be at odds with formal definitions. According to care staff challenging behaviors are actions that are difficult to manage. Staff causal attributions appear congruent with current theory, when measured with little specificity. However, when staff are asked to suggest causes of challenging behavior with clearly described functions they often fail to make appropriate attributions. Beliefs about appropriate short-term interventions suggest responses likely to develop and/or maintain challenging behavior, but beliefs about longer-term planned intervention appear to be more closely matched to contemporary practice. Reasons for this long-term/short-term distinction, based on the demands of the immediate situation, are proposed. Suggestions for future research on staff beliefs are discussed in detail.

Its cyclical patterns make it likely to impact and be impacted by marital relationships. The course of this illness may be affected by cognitive factors (i.e., the causal attributions made by patients and their spouses to explain events) and family factors (i.e., spouse expressed emotion/criticality). The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship that causal attributions have with marital distress, spouse critical comments, and symptom outcome in patients with bipolar disorder. Participants were recruited from the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and included 39 couples with one individual with bipolar disorder. They completed interviews, videotaped interactions, and self-report questionnaires measuring spouse criticality, symptomology, attributions, and marital distress. Results indicated that more distressed patients with bipolar disorder made more internal attributions to their spouses for negative events. Additionally, more critical spouses made more internal attributions to the patients for negative events and less internal attributions to themselves for negative events. Finally, although patient attribution variables did not predict symptom outcome, it was found that the more internal to patient, external to self, and stable the attributions for negative events made by the spouses, the more symptoms displayed by the patients at the end of 10 months of treatment. Implications of the current research are that spousal attributions were related to patient symptom outcome and should be addressed in cognitively based marital therapy. Additional research examining the extent to which attributions can be effectively modified as a result of psychotherapy, and exactly what impact that may have on the course of illness, is required. Other directions for future research as well as limitations of the current study are discussed.

The causal attributions of thirty-four ACS (23 males, 11 females), ranging in age from 12-20 years (M = 16.3, SD = 2.3) were elicited by semi-structured interview and rated for causal source (internal vs. external) and causal controllability (controllable vs. uncontrollable) using an adaptation of the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations method (Schulman, Castellon, & Seligman, 1988). Psychological adjustment was measured by the Mental Health Inventory (MHI). Social desirability was evaluated by the Crowne and Marlowe Social Desirability Scale. One-way ANOVAS were used to evaluate the relationship between causal variables and MHI scores. Multiple regression models were used to evaluate sociodemographic characteristics and illness-related factors for potential effects. The findings confirm that ACS, like adults, begin an attributional search when faced with a diagnosis of cancer. Ninety-one percent of participants reported asking themselves 'Why me?' and 90% specified personal theories. ACS gave a broad range of reasons why they got cancer, most commonly citing environmental exposures and heredity. The majority of adolescents attributed their cancers to external and uncontrollable causes. There were no statistically significant differences based on the causal source or causal controllability variables. The participants were psychologically well-adjusted, with MHI scores comparable to the normative sample. Age, in the context of other sociodemographics, had a significant effect on the relationship between causal attributions and psychological adjustment Older adolescents were relatively more distressed than younger adolescents. Illness-related factors were not significant predictors for this group of ACS. Social desirability response set did not affect MHI variables. The findings support Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale's (1978) reformulation of the learned helplessness model that external causes are associated with better psychological outcomes for illness events. If the association between external/uncontrollable attributions and adjustment is borne out by future research, then clinicians could profitably focus on reframing adolescents' attributions, when necessary, to causes which are perceived as outside of oneself and beyond one's control.

A retrospective methodology was used in order to explore the development of attributions from their first realization that their parent was behaving in a problematic manner to the present time. This study also explored the associations between attributions and participants' levels of coping and resiliency, as defined by their present functioning. The results of this study lend support to the use of an attributional framework in the study of children of the mentally ill. The data gathered using the Adult Children of the Mentally Ill-Attribution Scale (ACMI-AS) indicated reasonable internal consistency and expected intercorrelations of the attribution stems. A factor analysis of participants' responses to the ACMI-AS revealed three factors, including Internal to Self, Internal to Parent and Predictability. The data suggested that participants' attributions significantly changed from their initial realization of parental symptomatic behavior to the present time. The analysis indicated that maturity was not wholly responsible for the change in attributions. Rather, the subjective amount of information concerning mental illness as well as extra-familial support were significant contributing factors. The analyses between attributions and coping as well as between attributions and resiliency suggested a relationship between these variables. The data further suggested that attributions for parental control of the symptomatic behavior or personal control by the child were associated with increased psychopathology and lower self-esteem and self-efficacy in respondents. Attributions that highlighted predictability, external causation, and biological causation were associated with fewer somatic complaints and increased social self-efficacy.

Healthy Ss consented significantly more often to the statement that 'religion can make a person sick' than patients with affective and anxiety disorders, who experienced religion rather as support than as a burden. However, they perceived their illness-related problems as an obstacle to express their faith.

Increasingly, survivors are fleeing their countries to seek asylum in the West. Research on torture survivors has recently become an emerging field in mental health and psychologists are increasingly likely to encounter and treat survivors of torture.  The purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which ethnocultural identification and causal attributions account for quality of life in adult survivors of torture. The researcher applied attribution theory as a conceptual foundation to better understand how survivors find meaning for the good and bad events in their lives. The research also aimed to better understand the characteristics of torture survivors and to make recommendations to improve the quality of mental health care. The research questions asked the extent to which ethnocultural identification and causal attributions accounted for quality of life in survivors of torture and to what extent the causal dimensions of locus of causality, stability and controllability accounted for quality of life when controlling for the effects of ethnocultural identification. Additional supplementary analyses were included to investigate the relations among selected demographic and major variables.  The sample was highly diverse demographically and included 45 participants in treatment at the Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture in New York City. Results revealed that ethnocultural identification and causal attributions did not explain a significant portion of the variance in quality of life. Likewise, the causal dimensions did not account for a significant portion of the variance in quality of life. Supplementary analysis revealed the following significant findings: participants in treatment for longer periods were more likely to report a better quality of life, those with higher levels of education were more likely to report a better quality of life and a greater sense of overall control in their lives, and more educated survivors were in treatment for longer periods of time. Finally, Asian participants expressed a stronger identification and attachment with their ethnocultural group than either White or Black participants. Implications for research, theory, and treatment for psychologists working with this population an discussed.

Thus, although there are numerous studies concerning depression and anxiety separately, there is relative confusion regarding the cognitive variables which differentiate each of them. It is becoming increasingly clear that the study of cognitive specificity of depression and anxiety requires a comparative methodological approach that differentiates these states in the same study. In this paper the conclusions of a relatively limited number of studies adopting such an approach are presented. These studies generally focus on 'thought content', 'locus of control', 'causal attributions' and 'information processing'. Then, implications of these findings as well as certain methodological issues and weak points are discussed and, finally, ways are proposed in order to deal with them. More specifically, the discussion focuses mostly on the general distress (psychopathology) factor, the methods of assessment, the chronobiology of depression and anxiety, the control groups and the comparisons of multiple groups and their combinations.

Functions of demonic attributions as well as the various forms of deliverance rituals are described. Often patients do not hold rigid convictions of the spiritual causes of their illness. Rather they are developing very subjective interpretations which exist side by side with other medically oriented explanatory models. Although many patients reported beneficial effects as a result of deliverance rituals, psychiatric examination could not observe extraordinary or lasting changes in the symptomatology. Discrepancies in the causal attributions can lead to tensions between therapist and patient.

Dentist perceptions of the most intense stressors were (ranked): 1) running behind schedule, 2) causing pain, 3) heavy work load, 4) late patients and 5) anxious patients. Bivariate odds ratio (OR) analyses were undertaken to check for associations of perceived stress and other dentist variables with perceptual outcomes about anxious patients. Signs of dental anxiety were reported to be less often spotted by older (> or = 52 yr) dentists (OR=3.1) who perceived their job stress to be greater than that of other professionals (OR=3.2). Perceived causes of dental anxiety (1st, 2nd or 3rd choices tallied and then ranked) were 1) fear of pain, 2) trauma in dental treatment, 3) general psychological problems, 4) shame about dental status and 5) economic excuses. Dentists who reported that dental anxiety was primarily the result of general psychological problems in patients, usually had solo (OR=2.4) practices older than 18 years (OR=2.6) and reported high perceived stress (OR=2.2). Adjusted odds ratios for these two dentist perception outcomes about anxious patients generally improved strength of associations and confidence intervals. There were no meaningful differences by practice location or perceived public image. Also, there was no significant association between the use of pharmacological strategies for anxiety and the perceived stress of dentists.

The present study used a questionnaire of 469 1st-yr undergraduate students (17–42 yrs of age). Results replicate previous findings that the public tends to reject biological and genetic explanations of mental health problems in favor of psychosocial explanations focused on negative life events. It also confirms the previous findings concerning biological and genetic causal beliefs and negative attitudes. These attitudes include perceptions that 'mental patients' are dangerous, antisocial, and unpredictable, and reluctance to become romantically involved with them. The amount of reported personal contact with people who had received psychiatric treatment was correlated with positive attitudes. Authors recommend that destigmatization programs consider abandoning efforts to promulgate illness-based explanations, and focus instead on increasing contact with and exposure to users of mental health services.

Psychological symptoms as well as interpersonal problems were considered indicators of treatment effects. Results support the expectation that a psychosocial causal attribution of illness symptoms and a marked general openness to psychotherapy at the pretreatment interview predict more positive treatment outcomes.

Finally, key workers were asked to provide a new expectancy rating to forecast future goal attainment. Two predictions from Weiner's model were confirmed by statistical analysis: (1) that success attributed to stable factors would lead to higher revised forecast of goal attainment than success attributed to variable factors; and (2) that failure attributed to stable factors would lead to lower revised forecasts of goal attainment than failure attributed to variable factors.

The relationship between health beliefs and help-seeking behaviors was investigated as well. Participants in this study were 201 Latino adults from three health clinics in Los Angeles, California. Data was collected by means of the Latino Beliefs about the Causes of Illness Questionnaire (LBCI-Q) developed by the principal investigator for this study. This study employed a correlation design. It was hypothesized that four causal dimensions for the two illnesses would emerge from the LBCI-Q, that would reflect a connection between the mind, body, spirit, and social realm: Supernatural Dimension, Interpersonal/Social Dimension, Natural Dimension, and Patient Dimension. In addition, it was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between supernatural type of causes (e.g., witchcraft/spells) and traditional help-seeking behaviors (e.g., traditional healer). Finally, it was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between patient kinds of causes (e.g., diet, exercise) and western help-seeking behaviors (e.g., medical services). Principal Components Factor Analysis was used to test the first hypothesis. Five factors, instead of four, emerged in the factor analysis for each illness. These factors or casual dimensions provided moderate support for the hypothesis that Latino beliefs about the causes of hypertension and depression involved individual, family, community, natural, and supernatural causal agents. Exploratory analysis revealed that ethnicity, generation level, and education level influenced which causal dimensions were viewed as playing significant causal roles for hypertension and depression. A Pearson's R product-moment correlation coefficient was used to test the second and the third hypotheses. The results indicated that the type of help a person seeks when ill are related to the underlying causal beliefs a person holds. Latinos more closely tied to traditional cultural explanations were more likely to seek traditional support (e.g., traditional healer). On the other hand, Latinos more closely tied to western biomedical explanations were more likely to seek western support (e.g., medical doctor). The limitations of the study, contributions to the field of psychology, clinical implications, and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Investigations about motivation also stimulate many scientists and constitute another foundation of this study (13). The level of performance depends on knowledge and motivation (33). Time devoted to study is essential to succeed; so motivation and procrastination are in competition. The importance of reinforcement (extrinsical motivation) and the desire for learning and knowing (intrinsical motivation) are determinant. Other elements must be emphasized: guarantee of obtaining rewards, self efficacy and causal attribution. These considerations point out the multidimensional and interactive aspects of test anxiety (7, 31). The number of components is not described unanimously but experts agree with emotional, cognitive and behavioral dimensions (25). So, anxiety was approached in its motivational properties, and it was the case until the sixties, in terms of drive corresponding to a need like thirst or hunger (18); then it was conceptualized in a dynamic context broader than that of stress and coping (29, 30). Last, it constitutes the object of theories highlighting cognitive interference (9, 23, 26) or defective skills (8, 32). A lot of questionnaires were built without answering the different aspects and for instance without linking the theoretical and therapeutic components concerning this problem. Committed to the traditional fields of research (test anxiety and need of achievement), to Weiner's work about attribution theory (34) and that of Bandura in self efficacy (4, 5), E. Depreeuw (10) was particularly interested in Heckhausen's model (16, 17), trying to associate experimental conceptions with the clinical reality. On this basis, he elaborated the TASTE (10, 12, 20): test for ability to study and evaluation. At first constituted of 121 items, the self-questionnaire, after factorial analysis, was reduced to 78 items assessing 4 factors which represent the 8 components of Heckhausen's model (16). The first factor (30 items) concerns anxiety in its emotional and cognitive characteristics. Interesting data were observed by Depreeuw and confirmed in the Netherlands and in Greece (19), especially the fact that anxiety of girls is higher than that of boys when they are confronted with an exam. The second one (19 items) represents self-confidence: confidence in ability to succeed and on using adequate strategies. The third factor (14 items) squared with value attributed to performance. It especially comments on the intrinsical component of motivation. The fourth factor (15 items) corresponds to procrastination; study is postponed on behalf of activities which actually reduce the achievement process. The self-report questionnaire (where answers run from total disagreement to total agreement whether they correspond to the way of thinking or acting) takes account of the emotional, cognitive and behavioral dimensions of the model. The multidimensional aspect of this questionnaire, but mainly its connections with theory and clinic, are convincing; we adopted it with other tests in research about fear of failure. Validation of the French translation is the subject of this article. In order to realize this operation, we chose the initial version of TASTE (121 items) to assess a Belgian sample of french-speaking students in the first year of University of Liège (n = 617). They are differentiated by gender, faculty (Economy, Medicine, Philosophy, Psychology, Applied Sciences) and experience of failure, i.e. the fact of repeating a school year. Statistics were realized with SPSS and SAS. A comprehension test and a back translation are satisfactory. The stability over time too: the one week test-retest was achieved with a sample of 33 student nurses; comparing the factors two by two, intra-class correlations ranged from 0.5 to 0.95. The component analysis with Varimax rotation does not allow us to find the four factors of construction. We obtain the same disappointing results with the version of 78 items. According to the screentest, we adopted the solution of five factors which confirms the original construction. A fifth particularly strong factor (Cronbach's alpha 0.82) corresponds to devalorisation. The internal reliability is very satisfactory. If we consider the items strong loading (more than 0.30), the French version is constituted of 94 items. If we consider the items which are specifically loading each factor, we can reduce the questionnaire to 50 items. Internal reliability remains the same. Correlations between the data obtained with this brief version are satisfactory; comparing the factors in pairs. Pearson's coefficients range from 0.8 to 0.89. The study of E. Depreeuw was realized ten years ago with a Belgian sample of Flemish-speaking students; is the cultural context or an evolution in test anxiety which explains such a difference in the results? We are now assessing a sample in another country which used the TASTE in 1996 in order to have some information about comparison of samples. In any case, the questionnaire of E. Depreeuw respects the multidimensional aspect of test anxiety. Our choice of 5 factors according to principal components confirms the original structure of the test but also discriminates another factor which could be predictive of psychopathology (panic, depression). This new dimension measures negative perception of ability and achievement especially when compared with other students. One aim of such a study is to discern clusters of students i.e. groups of students with characteristics such as Covington (7), Depreeuw (20) and Zeidner (35) describe them. This description is very important; the French version is only a part of a very broader study including other tests and could differentiate student's profiles. The French version of 5 factors finally gives results in agreement with the original. The items (10 per factor) are selected according to their highest specificity and after elimination of redundancy. Validity remains in the short version, making it more useful in clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Fiona""=>""Excluded"", ""Consensus""=>""Excluded""}",,Aptitude*;Aptitude Tests*;Adolescent;Anxiety/psychology;Child;Female;Humans;Language;Male;Translating,,

The influence of factors such as levels of depressive symptoms and clinical status on causal beliefs and help seeking preferences was also examined. The results indicated that the Chinese lay people and health care professionals surveyed in this study hold similar and sophisticated psychosocial causal theories of depression that resemble those held in the 'West', and that, in general, Chinese lay people favour psychosocial interventions and self-help in overcoming depression. A factor analysis of the 26 causal attributions studied revealed seven clearly interpretable factors. These 'Causal Factors' were labelled; Biological/fatalistic, Environmental stress-downtrodden, Family problems, 'Lacks Inner Resources', Negative-depressing influences, Unfulfilled Aspirations and Poor Health/Environment. The Causal Factors receiving the highest endorsements in the aetiology of depression were 'Lacks Inner Resources' and 'Family problems'. A factor analysis of the 16 help seeking alternatives studied revealed four clearly interpretable factors. These 'Help Seeking Factors' were labelled; Traditional/Western medical, Supernatural/folk, Social support/self-help and Mental health professional. The Help Seeking Factors receiving the highest endorsements were 'Social support/self-help' and 'Mental Health Professional'. Strong positive correlations were found between the Causal Factors 'Biological/fatalistic' and 'Poor Health/Environment' and the Help Seeking Factors 'Traditional/Western medical' and 'Supernatural/folk'. There was also a significant effect of the level of depressive symptoms and clinical status (whether or not subjects were in treatment for depression) on subjects' ratings of both causal beliefs and help seeking preferences. Weak, but statistically significant, correlations were found between the severity of depressive symptoms and the 'Supernatural/folk' and the 'Traditional/Western medical' help seeking factors. A moderate and negative correlation was found to exist between clinical status and the 'Family problems' causal factor. Clinical status was moderately and positively correlated with the Mental health professional and Traditional/Western medical help seeking factor. The results are discussed with respect to understanding the nature and impact of causal models of depression on help seeking with a view to better targeting of interventions for depressed Chinese people.

Even after stratification by clinically significant impairment and paid employment status, men reported fewer symptoms than women; as a consequence, men reached the diagnostic threshold less often. In wave II there were clear gender differences in causal attribution and in coping.

In a short-term perspective, attributing the MI to stress causes and husbands' personality was associated with worse emotional adjustment.

To examine this possibility, we interviewed Dominican mothers (mean age 34.8 yrs old) of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on: their children's behaviors, the identification process, diagnosis, causal attributions, management strategies, help-seeking efforts, school relationship and performance, and relationship with school personnel. We interviewed the families' Latina clinicians on their perspectives on maternal understanding and practices. Maternal and clinicians' narratives were analyzed qualitatively to develop a portrait of maternal schemas and of clinicians' schemas of the mothers. The narratives reveal widely differing perspectives and illustrate the collisions that can occur between mothers and clinicians in the treatment process despite an ethnic match.

This study aimed to investigate complaints of fatigue after treatment for breast cancer.; Patients and Methods: The study patients were 150 women who had finished curative treatment for breast cancer by a mean of 29 months before commencement of this study. Measurements included computerised questionnaires and a daily Self-Observation List.; Results: Thirty-eight per cent of the sample were severely fatigued, compared with 11% in a matched sample of women without a history of cancer. No association was found between fatigue and former treatment. The 'severely fatigued disease-free breast cancer patient' scored more 'problematic' on psychological well-being, functional impairment, sleep disturbance, physical activity, social support, neuropsychological and social functioning compared with the 'non-severely fatigued disease-free breast cancer patient'. Furthermore, the severely fatigued patients had a lower sense of control with respect to their fatigue complaints and stronger breast cancer- and psychologically-related attributions with regard to the causes of fatigue compared with the non-severely fatigued patients. Regression analyses indicated that sleep disturbance, physical activity and causal attributions contributed significantly to the subjective experience of fatigue.; Conclusions: Severe fatigue is a problem for almost 40% of the sample of breast cancer survivors.

Relatives who are highly critical, hostile, or emotionally overinvolved are considered high EE. The utility of expressed emotion for predicting the course of schizophrenia has been demonstrated; however, little is known about the nature of EE. Studies in the U.S. and England demonstrate that EE is related to relatives' causal beliefs of the schizophrenia patient's negative behaviors. However, such a link has not been assessed in China, where cultural attribution patterns and causal models of schizophrenia differ from Western countries. The present study examined the relationship between relatives' causal attributions and EE by examining 48 Camberwell Family Interviews (a semi-structured interview used to measure EE) collected from 1990-1999 in three cities in China. Spontaneous causal attributions were extracted from these interviews using the Leeds Attributional Coding System. Relatives' causal attributional styles were predicted to be associated with type of EE and also with ratings of how stigmatized the patient and family perceived themselves to be. Causal attributions and EE were then compared for their ability to predict patient relapse at 18 months after discharge. Attributional variables were not found to be significantly associated with perceived stigma. However, consistent with theoretical predictions, among attributional variables indicating that the patient played a causal role in his or her own negative behaviors, high critical and high critical/hostile EE groups articulated attributions that were more controllable and personal to the patient than high emotionally overinvolved and low EE groups. Among attributional variables indicating that the relative played a causal role in the patient's negative behaviors, high EE groups made more internal and controllable attributions to the relative than low EE groups. A combination of EE measures with controllability and personal attributional variables significantly predicted relapse at 18 months among Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Although there was a trend for EE alone to predict relapse at 18 months, controllability and personal attributions by the relative incrementally improved predictive validity when considered in conjunction with EE.

The existing research is primarily descriptive and confirms that public attitudes toward people with mental illness are generally negative. Building on the existing knowledge, this study will integrate political ideology and labeling theory perspectives into an attribution model to understand the nature of mental illness stigma and the determinants of discriminatory behavior towards individuals with mental illness. Data from the vignette experiment contained in the MacArthur Mental Health Module of the 1996 General Social Survey is used to examine the influence of political ideology, causal attributions, illness course, and perceptions of dangerousness on several types of behavior. Results of path analysis with manifest variables suggest that while perceived dangerousness and illness condition were the primary predictors of desire for social distance; conservatism, illness condition, attributions of bad character, dangerousness, and beliefs about illness course are significant predictors of support for coercive treatment. Political ideology was the only significant predictor of support for government provision of mental health services. Thus, the analysis suggests that cognitive processes may differ depending on the behavioral outcome in question. This would indicate that stigma change strategies should be tailored to specific desired behavioral outcomes. This study was based on a deliberative attributional cognitive process. Future research should examine both deliberative and automatic cognitive processes.

A theoretical model is proposed to explain the positive and negative effects that Christian social support has upon individuals experiencing symptoms of depression. It is proposed that causal attributions about depression found within the conservative Christian community mediate the quality of social support. Abramson, Seligman and Teasdale's (1978) formulation of three dimensions of causal attributions is used to analyze a sample of attributions about depression observed by the authors within the conservative Christian community. It is theorized that the beneficial or harmful impact of various attributions about depression is not primarily related to the accuracy of the attributions, but rather to how these attributions fall along these three dimensions. Whether social support is depression-buffering or depression-maintaining is hypothesized to be an effect of the quality of the attributions made about the depressive symptoms and the helping behaviors that logically proceed from these attributions.

However, the effect of religion as a cultural determinant of treatment utilization is largely understudied. Previous studies suggest that religious fundamentalists are more likely to endorse spiritual and demonic explanations for mental illness and are less willing to seek help from secular mental health professionals. However, these studies are based on small, regional, non-probability samples and have failed to adequately control for the effects of other sociodemographic variables such as education. This study utilized data from two nationally representative surveys, the 1996 and 1998 General Social Surveys (GSS), to examine the effect of beliefs about the authorship, inerrancy, and interpretation of the Bible on beliefs about the perceived causes and preferred treatments for mental disorders. Respondents who said that they believed the Bible was 'the word of God' and should be 'interpreted word for word' (Bible Believers) were more likely than other GSS respondents to say that the vignette subject's condition was caused by 'his or her own bad character.' However, Bible Believers were just as likely as other respondents to say that the condition was caused by 'a chemical imbalance in the brain.' Bible Believers were more likely than other respondents to say that the vignette character should 'talk to a minister, rabbi, priest, or other religious leader.' However, they were just as likely as other respondents to endorse that the vignette character 'go to a psychiatrist,' 'take prescription medication,' and 'go see a therapist or counselor, such as a social worker, psychologist, or other mental health professional.' Bible Believers were more likely than other GSS respondents to say that individuals should stop taking psychiatric medications as soon as symptoms subside. This study suggests that social workers should be aware of the potential clinical implications of Bible Believers' views regarding the causes and best treatments for mental disorders. It also suggests that more research is needed to further understand how these views may affect the course and outcome of mental health treatments.

In support of attribution-affect theory, relatives who reported feeling more compassion toward an ill family member also reported exerting more effort to help their relative cope with the illness. A qualitative analysis of relatives' views, values, and behaviors was also conducted. We observed the following three main categories of attributions: (1) most participants accepted the patient as having a legitimate illness, (2) the majority of participants viewed interpersonal problems or other external environmental stressors as causing or exacerbating the disorder, and (3) many participants implicated God in their causal attributions and also reported turning to religion as a source of hope and comfort in coming to terms with the patient's illness.

Survey techniques were used to assess how 66 college students view the etiology of depression. Etiology beliefs, as well as demographic data, were regressed upon measures of treatment preference, empowerment, and stigma. Factor analysis produced three distinct models of etiology: biological, psychological, and environmental. Regression analyses showed that endorsement of the biological model was associated with increased empowerment, preference for psychotherapy, and decreased stigma. Endorsing the psychological model was associated with an increased belief that people can help themselves and increased stigma. Endorsing the environmental model was associated with a mixture of positive and negative beliefs concerning depression. The current public emphasis on viewing depression as biologically based should thus be viewed with some caution.

In this empirical study the participants (50 Iranian women between the ages of 30 to 65, who were in Iran for at least two years after Islamic Revolution) were interviewed by using the Persian version of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). A relationship was found between the number of traumatic experiences and PTSD scores for the whole group, but the correlation between these factors did not hold when controlling for the religious group. T-tests revealed that those women who were persecuted for religious beliefs reported a significantly lower number of PTSD symptoms, despite a higher number of traumatic experiences. They also reported having a significantly weaker health condition, worse support system and were of older age than those persecuted for non-religious reasons. Using step-wise multiple regressions, other relevant predictors (e.g., demographic information) of severity of PTSD were also examined, but the reason for persecution was still found to remain as a significant predictor of PTSD above and beyond all these other factors.

Although sensation and affect are well recognized as two principal dimensions of pain, it is still largely unknown how they function and interact in the experience of pain and what psychological factors may affect the specific aspects of pain experience. This study investigated the relationships of people's sensitivity to sensory stimuli (represented by sensory vigilance) and ability to process emotional information (represented by alexithymia status) to their experience of sensory, affective, and overall pains. Methods. Subjects were 159 individuals who reported some experience of pain within the week prior to their participation in the study. Subjects rated their sensory, affective, and overall pains on the Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) and the Pain Rating Index (PRI) of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, and completed questionnaires relating to sensory vigilance, alexithymia, psychopathology, pain features, and demographics. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the unique contributions of sensory vigilance and alexithymia to sensory, affective, and overall pains over and above demographic, pain feature, and psychopathological variables. Results. Sensory vigilance was significantly predictive of sensory pain based on the VASs, and sensory, affective, and total pains based on the PRI, when demographic, pain feature, and psychopathological variables were statistically controlled. Alexithymia status was not a unique predictor of any of the pain ratings. The results further indicated that sensory, affective, and overall pains based on the VASs and the PRI had very distinct profiles of unique predictors. VASs pain ratings showed greater associations with demographic variables, while PRI pain ratings had stronger relationships to sensory vigilance and pain causal attribution. Different combinations of unique predictors were also found between sensory and affective pains. Conclusion. Sensory vigilance is a significant predictor of pain experience over and above many other pain-correlates. Its potential influences on the experience of pain should be reflected in pain knowledge and treatment. Results also suggest that information about pain severity based on a single dimension and a single type of measure can be incomplete and problematic.

Using unlabelled vignettes depicting cases of major depressive disorder or schizophrenia, the authors surveyed the causal beliefs of people from three different cultures. In particular, they focused on the relationship between social, biological or other causal beliefs and social distance. Significantly, they conclude that biological causal beliefs ('brain disease' and 'heredity') are associated with greater social distance and suggest that current public campaigns to reduce stigma based on the concept of mental illness as biological in origin may be counterproductive.

In giving their reasons for verdicts and sentences, the majority of judges accounted for the assaults by drawing on psychological concepts and constructs. These psychological explanations or causal attributions were grouped into one or more of eight categories: alcohol and drug abuse, biological or sexual drive, psychopathology, dysfunctional family upbringing, stress and trauma, character or personality trait, emotional state, and loss of control. The causal attributions in all categories systematically reformulated deliberate acts of violence into non-deliberate and non-violent acts. Psychologizing attributions, that is, causal attributions that functioned to conceal the violence and mitigate the perpetrator's responsibility, accounted for 97 percent of attributions. Through line-by-line analyses of the full text of one judgment, we show how psychologizing attributions are combined in use with other linguistic devices to (i) conceal violence, (ii) mitigate perpetrators' responsibility, (iii) conceal victims' resistance, and (iv) blame or pathologize victims.

A total of 141 individuals were recruited from two settings: an outpatient skin clinic at King's College Hospital and the Psoriasis Association. Results: A strong belief in stress/psychological attributes as a causal factor was found in 61% of the sample. This belief was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression and perceived stress (r≥.38; P≤.0001). Perceived stress in this sample was significantly associated with a poorer level of quality of life, higher levels of anxiety and depression (r≥.27; P≤.002) but not with psoriasis severity.

Causal attributions for negative and positive life experiences were extracted from interview transcripts and rated using the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations (CAVE) technique. It was found that, as a proportion, paranoids made more attributions for negative events that were of an external-personal, stable and global nature (as attributional models would predict). They also made significantly more external-personal attributions for negative events and, in one of two datasets, showed a more external mean CAVE rating for negative events than the non-paranoid controls.

The perceived causes were mainly divided into two groups: (a) factors relating to the early family socialization and (b) genetic factors. Other possible causes included a traumatic event in later life, karmic influence based on the Buddhist perspective, and cult religion. However, few were convinced about their own theories as most wavered between different causal explanations and continued to question what caused it. The parents were often tormented by self-blame, and some family members still doubted the diagnosis and hoped the patient's problem was caused by drug addiction. Regardless of the accuracy of their causal attribution, their mental struggle is an important part of the cognitive adjustment process toward better acceptance of the mental illness in the family.

Having a child with autism places a number of burdens on the shoulders of the parents and other family members. Therefore the quality of life of these families might be altered as a result. Since family members' perceptions of disability influence the process of adaptation and adjustment of the family, this study examined how perceptions might ultimately relate to the family quality of life. In addition, the relationship between demographic variables such as income, child's age, parental education, depression, and satisfaction with services was also examined. Primary caregivers of a child with ASD from Illinois (N = 175) were surveyed concerning their perceptions of autism, their mental health, demographic factors, and their family quality of life. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the relationship between perceptions, demographic factors and quality of life was examined. Results suggest a significant relationship between perceptions of positive contributions of autism to the family and family quality of life. In addition, a significant relationship was found between each variable: child's age, income, and depression and the variable: family quality of life. No significant relationship was found between the way families perceived causes of autism and family quality of life. In addition, a qualitative analysis was conducted to examine family members' perceptions more closely. The results suggest that in general family members define the effects of autism on their personal life as positive as compared to the effects on the family as a unit. Positive contributions of autism were articulated to be family closeness, learned lessons in compassion, change of outlook of life, patience, and personal empowerment. Negative effects of autism were identified to be alteration of the family's functions, strained relationships and personal goals, and parental depression. Generally, parents had positive working models of their child with autism, and described their child in very affectionate terms.

In addition, environmental factors which may play a role in the development of learned helplessness are discussed in the light of the literature. In the last two sections, psychiatric and other medical disorders that are associated with learned helplessness are reviewed. Method: Researches and reviews were screened and developmental characteristics were summarized. Results: There are ambiguities about how early children may develop learned helplessness or how this process occurs. The view that behavioral pattern of learned helplessness does not occur until late childhood was dominated during the past several decades. In later studies, it was shown that helplessness behaviors may occur in younger children following repeated failure experiences. This helplessness experience, with its emotional, behavioral and cognitive reflections causes vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, especially to depression, and may have a negative impact on coping skills of children and families with chronic diseases. Discussion: Detecting helplessness behavior patterns which may have negative consequences at early ages and planning intervention strategies based on these patterns seem important in terms of successful treatment outcome.

Attributions were coded from narrative interviews to limit problems such as unclear questionnaires and irrelevant hypothetical stimuli. Trait attributions were identified as well as causal attributions for specific experiences. Mothers' attributions were assessed for two children from each family to examine within family as well as between family differences in attributions based on gender and sibling status. Attributions for behaviors were coded separately from attributions for mental states to explore the importance of making this distinction. Coded attributions were correlated with several other parent and child variables to determine which are useful predictors of family functioning. Transcripts of interviews with mothers were reliably sorted into individual references to children's behaviors, mental states, or traits, and positive or negative valence was indicated. Causal attributions were then identified and reliably sorted into several categories that were compiled into scales similar to those addressed in previous research. Mothers made different types of attributions statements for older and younger siblings. They spoke more positively in general about older siblings, and made more negative, child-centered attributions about younger siblings. Mothers also differed in their attribution statements about boys compared with girls. More references were made to negative behaviors about boys, but boys were also described with more positive traits. Different patterns of causal attributions were also identified for boys and girls. Differences between attributions for behaviors and mental states were examined, and different patterns were apparent for boys and girls, although no sibling status differences were identified. Attribution scales were correlated with several family functions variables. Several important associations were identified. In general, more positive and less negative attributions were related to less harsh discipline by mothers, more mother-rated relationship satisfaction and less conflict, more positive and less negative mother-child interaction ratings, fewer child behavior problems, less negative child temperament ratings, more positive and less negative treatment by mothers, and better maternal responses to children's emotions. These patterns were generally more robust for older than younger siblings, and for girls as compared with boys.

Although folk psychology may initially seem to be a rather simple sort of thing, it can actually be surprisingly difficult to figure out precisely how it works. One common view is that folk psychology is best understood as a tool for predicting and explaining behavior. The key idea here is that, if we attribute mental states to other people, we will be able to do a better job of predicting and explaining the behaviors they subsequently perform. Philosophers who hold this view often suggest that folk psychology is something like a scientific theory. The present dissertation argues for a radically different view. It suggests that folk psychology might be better understood as a kind of multi-purpose tool. Specifically, the claim is that folk psychology should be understood as a tool not only for generating predictions and explanations but also for generating moral judgments. The dissertation begins with a general theoretical defense of this approach. It then proceeds to apply the approach to three major aspects of folk psychology. The first of these is people's ordinary concept of intentional action. A series of experiments demonstrate that people's attributions of intentional action in particular cases can actually be influenced by their moral beliefs. This result suggests that moral considerations may actually be playing a role in the concept of intentional action itself. The second aspect is our ordinary practice of reason explanation. Here again, a series of experiments demonstrate the role of moral considerations and thereby suggest that morality may play a role in the relevant concepts. The final aspect to be considered is people's practice of causal attribution. Moral considerations have long been known to play a role in this practice; the claim defended here is that this role is best understood in terms of the nature of the concept of causation itself.

Participants (N = 187) read a vignette describing an individual with one of three psychological disorders (schizophrenia, depression, ADHD). The information manipulated in the vignette included: the type of disorder, whether a formal diagnostic label was attached to the individual or only a description of the defining behavioral problems, and whether there was any situational information provided related to the individual's difficulties. Participants answered multi-question measures about the perceived causes of the individual's problem, perceived controllability, perceived stability of the condition, and perceived violence potential. In addition, participants reported affective reactions and social distance preferences. Data were subjected to a series of 3 x 2 x 2 MANOVAs and ANOVAs. Presence of Diagnostic Label significantly affected causal, stability, and controllability attributions of participants. Labeling also resulted in more positive affective reactions toward the target experiencing ADHD but had no significant impact on social distance preferences. Type of Diagnosis also yielded numerous significant effects in terms of perceived causality, stability, and affective reactions, particularly for the vignette depicting depressive difficulties. Presence of Situation significantly affected participants' causality attributions. Situational information led to greater positive affect, but only for those vignettes not containing a diagnostic label. While independent variables had numerous significant main effects, Situation X Diagnosis interactions, particularly those involving judgments of depressed targets, were most informative. Participants' familiarity and experience with those with mental illnesses had no main effects for any of the dependent variables. However, a significant three-way interaction effect for Situation X Diagnosis X Familiarity occurred in terms of social distance preferences. The study is considered within the context of the 'signaling event-attribution-affect-action' model of Corrigan (1998, 2000, 2004).

His main emphasis was on three aspects: a) Melancholia (pessimism, hopelessness and anhedonia) -b)Anxiety and insecurity - c) Morbid doubt and querulous melancholia. In his descriptive approach, William James looked beyond psychopathology at individual attempts to understand the inexplicable in their mental distress. Diagnostic systems have changed over the last hundred years, but his categories still have their validity although they should include psychosis which can present in religious delusions. Anthropology has taught us to distinguish between disease and the subjective experience of illness. Mental suffering can become so distressing that the afflicted person experiences it as foreign and externally oppressed. Depending on a person's cultural and religious background the causes can be seen in a religious context or even in personalized spiritual forces. The author introduces the term 'spiritualization of psychopathology'. Such spiritualized causal attributions are frequent in delusional disorders. However, they are also found in anxiety and mood disorders, as well as in personality disorders accompanied by behavior and drives which are not acceptable to the individual. Thus, the discrepancy between a person's ideal and subjective experience is interpreted in a spiritual or religious terminology. Religious interpretations of causality can be understood in the framework of cultural sensitivity, which is underlined in new formulations of the DSM-IV. Often patients do not hold rigid convictions of the spiritual causes of their illness. Rather they are developing very subjective interpretations which exist side by side with other medical or psychodynamic models of explanation. Discrepancies in the causal attributions can lead to tensions between therapist and patient. Assessment of religious attributions and their functions should lead to a 'shared construction of meaning' resulting in better support and coping.

In this study, questionnaires using vignettes of fictitious crimes were completed by 80 care staff in residential homes and 65 police officers. The fictitious perpetrators in the vignettes were described either as non-disabled or as having ID. Care staff and police ratings of causal attributions and affect were compared, and the effect of perpetrator status (with or without ID) was also examined. The findings confirmed that care staff are still reluctant to report incidents by people with ID to the police. Carer and police views were generally in accord concerning perpetrators without ID but there were significant differences between groups rating perpetrators with ID.

Supplementary sections of the MINI explore help seeking and pathways to care, treatment experience, adherence and impact of the illness on identity, self-perception and relationships with others. Narratives produced by the MINI can be used with a wide variety of interpretive strategies drawn from medical anthropology, sociology and discursive psychology.

The second part briefly reviews the theme of religious attribution of causes of mental illness. Pfeifer discusses his own research on the subject in which it was demonstrated that demonic causal attributions were not specifically related to psychosis (schizophrenia) but to the ego-dystonic quality of certain perception, feelings, and actions. Pfeifer uses the term ego-dystonic in its classical sense of the quality of unfamiliarity and strangeness; what happens in one's perception, feeling, or action does not belong to oneself and is, in cases of demonic attribution, explained by the influence of demons. The third part of his chapter argues for the need to build bridges between biblical 'models' and bio-psycho-social psychiatry. Biblical models of mental distress are more complicated and rich than is suggested by concepts like sin, curse, and demonic possession. Biblical texts do support an integrative view on the patient in which biological, psychological, and sociological aspects are interwoven. In the final paragraph Pfeifer offers a plea for a supportive, integrative and value-sensitive approach to the patient. Therapy should focus on helping the patient to get a multivariate view of their conflicts and their suffering within the framework of personal faith, thus achieving a constructive reintegration of faith into the whole range of experience and coping with the existential reality of life.

One way to increase the use of such services is to understand their causal beliefs and help-seeking behaviors. The aim of this study was to examine how causal attributions of three types of psychiatric symptoms (depressive, anxious, and schizophrenic) were associated with preferred sources of help among a group of university students in Singapore. Cross-sectional data were collected through a survey questionnaire with symptom vignettes and examined by path analyses. Main results showed that endorsements of causal attributions varied by symptoms; for example, depressive and anxious symptoms were more likely than schizophrenic symptoms to be attributed to psychosocial causation. Based on separate path analyses for every symptom type, both psychosocial and biomedical causations were correlated with each other, which in turn were associated with various sources of help. Psychosocial causation was associated with the source of friend/classmate whereas biomedical causation was associated with the sources of medical doctor, mental health professional, and alternative medical practitioner. Seeking helps from these professional sources were also correlated with each other. These findings suggest that causal attributions, particularly biomedical dimensions of psychiatric symptoms, should be highlighted when implementing relevant mental health services for university students; and they may be receptive to a holistic treatment team consisting of friends, medical doctors, mental health professionals, and alternative medical practitioners.

An individual's stance toward victims was conceived of as negative attitudes as well as a tendency to hold victims of sexual violence responsible for their assaults. Current thinking with regard to attribution formation proposes a multi-step model that captures the overarching process by which causal attributions are formed (Weiner, 1990), but this model does not account for the individual differences that may moderate movement between those steps. The growing body of research that examines victim-blaming tendencies has identified several variables associated with increased victim-blame, highlighting the role of individual differences in the mechanisms by which causal attributions are formed. These variables include sex, sex-role orientation, political orientation, religious conservatism and worldview. This dissertation proposed that personal ideology, a variable found to be associated with value-laden dimensions of personality such as religiosity, political orientation and worldview, will also be associated with individual differences in stance toward victims of sexual assault. The role of sex and sex-role orientation was also examined. This dissertation employed a two-step design that made use of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Measured used to operationalize individuals' stance toward victims include the Perceived Causes of Rape Scale (Cowan & Quinton, 1997) and the Attitudes toward Rape Victims Scale (Ward, 1988). Personal ideology was operationalized using Stone and Schaffner's (1988) Modified Polarity Scale, and sex-role orientation was assessed using the Women's Rights and Roles Questionnaire (Coppolillo, 2003). Results of analysis via 2x2 ANOVA demonstrated that those high in the normative dimension of personal ideology tend to be more blaming of victims of sexual assault and also hold more negative attitudes toward victims than do those who are less normatively-oriented. Qualitative analysis of small group discussions on the causes of sexual assault mirrored this finding. Implications for outreach and education efforts to prevent sexual assault and improve response to victims are discussed. Coppolillo, C. M. (2003).

Narratives of illness were elicited from informants. Physical symptomatology was a prominent feature of presentation in this group. These patients did not discuss their health problems conceptualized as uniform 'models' of illness, but rather in an attributional style that emphasized the experience of traumatic life events, often related to the overarching problem of exile and settlement. Childhood and family issues of poverty and domestic violence were often raised by patients, but tended to be backgrounded as having little contributory significance. These patients sought intervention, serially or in combination, from a diverse range of practitioners, including private healthcare and traditional healers or hocas. Their explanatory models of illness were complex and fragmentary and the relationship between explanations and help seeking is seldom linear.

Chapter 1 begins with an outline of relevant background ideas in categorization research and evidence of how knowledge influences categorization decisions. From here, Chapter 2 presents the first set of experiments. These experiments test how the acquiring of knowledge and formation of beliefs can influence the categorization of causal events. Experiment 1 of Chapter 2 presents participants with ambiguously defined causal events and tests how a causal belief can be used to categorize these ambiguous items. Experiment 2 explores how the strength of the belief that is acquired affects the categorization process. The influence of the categorization of ambiguous causal events on overall causal strength beliefs is tested in Experiment 3. Experiment 4 takes the idea of categorizing ambiguous causal events to a new arena and looks at how ambiguous temporal events are categorized. Chapter 3 presents a new experimental paradigm and looks at how previously acquired background knowledge affects reasoning about categories. Mental health clinicians who have great experience in dealing with mental disorder categories were tested to determine how this experience affects their memory for mental disorder categories. Clinicians' memory performance was compared to less experienced participant groups in order to determine how memory develops over the acquiring of experience and background knowledge. The implications of this research are discussed in the end of Chapter 3. After this discussion, the ideas that have been presented in this manuscript are summarized in Chapter 4.

Adults with mild ID perceive stressful social interactions as occurring more frequently and as having a greater impact than other types of negative life events. Adults with mild ID also report a lower rate of adaptive coping to deal with stressful social interactions than for other categories of stressors. Stressful social interactions, the causal attributions for them, and coping may be salient features of depression in adults with mild ID. In Chapter 1, the stressful social interactions, category of others with whom these interactions occur, specific interpersonal components of social interactions perceived as stressful, and coping strategies of 114 adults with mild ID were assessed. Stressful social interactions involving other people with ID occurred most frequently and had the highest stress impact. Controlling aggression, being involved and sociable, and self-assertion were the most stressful components of social interactions. Adults with mild ID reported using Problem-Focused coping more frequently than Emotion-Focused or Support Seeking coping. Active coping was negatively related to psychological distress. In Chapter 2, the stressful social interactions, casual attributions, and coping strategies of 62 adults with mild ID with and without depression were evaluated. Depressed adults with mild ID reported a higher frequency and stress impact of stressful social interactions, exhibited a more negative attribution style, and utilized fewer active and more avoidant coping strategies than non-depressed adults. Findings have implications for theory building and development of interventions to increase the psychological wellbeing of adults with mild ID.

Match-related cognitions remained stable in the lead up to competition, while perceptions of physical symptoms peaked at the onset of performance. Affective responses were associated with feelings of anxiety and tension in the early temporal phases but excitement, confidence, and efficacy in team-mates directly before competition. Behavioural themes described activities associated with technical and physical preparation, familiarization with environmental conditions, and strategies to control activation states early on or directly before competition. The findings highlight the idiosyncratic and dynamic nature of the temporal patterning of precompetitive responses and the influence that perceptions of the team have upon individual preparation for performance. Implications are discussed in the context of the type and timing of intervention for developing individual and team preparatory routines.

A self-regulation theory developed by researcher Howard Leventhal proposes that individuals form common-self beliefs concerning their illness in order to understand and cope with health threats. The five main components of patients' ideas about their illness include personal beliefs as well as causal beliefs about what caused their condition. The research has found psychosocial factors to be the most common cause depression whereas schizophrenia has been stated as the cause for organic disorders such as genetic problem or a brain disorder.

Research has demonstrated that perception of illness impacts what treatments a person will deem appropriate for their mental health problems and from whom they will seek treatment. Research also indicates that certain ethnic groups are more likely to seek treatment for their symptoms of depression in the primary care setting. Yet, it is unclear how they actually perceive their symptoms and what best predicts the treatments that they are likely to consider acceptable. A convenient sample of 109 HIV+ adults, 79 diabetic adults, and 3 adults with both conditions were recruited for this study. Participants had to be receiving services for either HIV, diabetes, or both conditions in one of the three central Austin facilities and be a representative from one of three racial/ethnic groups: African Americans, Latino, and White. Differences were found across ethnicity with regard to causal beliefs and treatment preferences for the symptoms of depression both among the HIV and the diabetic subgroups. Latinos in both groups were more likely than Whites to prefer counseling or a single form of treatment over combined treatment methods. Diabetic Latinos were more likely to prefer counseling for symptoms of depression. HIV seropositive individuals who reported the least number of symptoms of physical illness were more likely to attribute their symptoms of depression to stressful life events, whereas those who reported the greatest number of symptoms of physical illness were more likely to attribute their symptoms of depression to their medical illness. Additionally among the HIV subgroup, individuals who reported high stress tended to predict the preferences for treatment provided by a psychiatrist/psychologist and Whites scored highest on this factor. Finally, differences in depression scores across race/ethnicity were also revealed. The utility of assessing a patient's understanding of symptoms of depression in order to determine how personal illness models impact treatment preferences and knowledge of patient's causal attributions can aid medical social workers and physicians in collaborative management of chronic illness and depression are discussed.

In the current studies, I examine beliefs about the biological and psychological causes of mental disorders and how they relate to beliefs about the effectiveness of medication and therapy at treating different disorders. In Study 1, I found a systematic preference for within-domain cures among undergraduates: the more a mental disorder is regarded as biologically caused, the more effective medication is thought to be at treating it, with the opposing trend for psychotherapy. The opposite pattern of treatment preferences was found for disorders thought be psychologically caused. In Study 2, I examined beliefs about how treatments affect the mind and brain, and find that undergraduates and adults believe therapy actually has more effect on the mind than the brain, and medication has more effect on the brain than the mind. This systematic pattern suggests that people might be swayed by dualist forms of reasoning, in which they think of biological and psychological phenomena as largely separate and causally distinct domains. Consistent with this idea, in Study 3, I found that people are willing to agree that the symptoms of more psychologically-caused disorders are less a reflection of brain-functioning than more biologically-caused disorders. In Study 4, I examined clinicians' causal beliefs about disorders and found that though they acknowledge all disorders are caused by both biological and psychological factors, the relative importance of each type of cause varies across disorders. Finally, in Study 5, I found that similar to undergraduates, clinicians believe that cases of a mental disorder caused by biological factors are thought more treatable by medication than cases of the same disorder caused by psychological causes. I discuss whether such beliefs about treatment are normative, their possible impact on adherence to prescribed treatments, and the implications of causal beliefs for attitudes, blame, and sympathy for those suffering from mental disorders.

Results: the African-Caribbean patients did not describe more perceived discrimination than their white counterparts but were more likely to claim that their distress was due to racial discrimination perpetrated by the psychiatric services and society in general.

Results: Medical and psychology students showed a substantial level of negative attitudes. Personal contact was negatively associated with stereotypes among medical students and positively associated among psychology students. Positive attitudes were related to biogenetic causal beliefs among medical students and to psychosocial causal beliefs among psychology students.

They claim to have found that the behaviors in the vignette and a belief in personal weakness as a cause are both 'more important' factors than illness conceptualizations or genetic causal beliefs. In fact, their study provides no evidence to support either of these claims.

This was supplemented by the use of linguistic analysis demonstrating the enormous heterogeneity and complexity of responses to terrorism. In light of previous work on the wider impact of terrorism, the present study highlighted a relatively restrained impact of terrorism. Notwithstanding this observation, responses were marked by negative emotions, with increased use of references to others than for self. Responses also highlighted the use of psychological distancing more among white than Asian respondents, and the importance of religion, both as a supportive factor and perceived cause of the attacks, with references more prevalent among Asian respondents. Although the ubiquitous nature of negative emotions also slightly heightened reports of perceived risk, the ability of respondents to use methods of social orientation helped their ability to recover, and may be crucial in helping harness unified community-based responses to terrorism.

The new «psychosocial risk» category is part of this legacy. It reproduces and partly renews the stakes which are linked to these socio-historical constructions. Indeed the link between health and work is always grasped through its negative and deleterious effects. Thus, it denies the important issues of the health of the «unemployed» as well as work as a source of health. The «games» around causal attribution are still alive between the supporters of the «risk exposure» and those of the proneness to illness of the «fragile» people. As the issues about health appear to be individualized and eugenics trends seem to be growing, it leads to a sort of «omerta» about the question linked to work and health because of the fear of the stigma. Such a silence may be a counterproductive form of resistance as it contribuets to the fatigue and loneliness of each one in front of the unavoidable experience of fragility which is not a personal one but a human one.

Efforts to understand and address these disparities should include research to understand how Latino parents perceive and respond to child behaviors within an ecological framework, as broad contextual factors are known to influence parenting and help-seeking. To this end, the present study utilized grounded theory methodology to analyze in-depth interviews conducted with a community sample of 25 ethnically-diverse Latino mothers of varying levels of socioeconomic status (SES). The primary aims for the study were: (1) To examine parental understanding and perceptions of DSM-IV ADHD and ODD symptoms; (2) To explore and describe self-reported parenting and help-seeking responses to clinical levels of child ADHD and ODD behaviors, as depicted in hypothetical behavioral vignettes; and (3) To explore general childrearing values and socialization goals among Latino mothers. Each of these aims were examined from an ecological perspective by considering demographic and psychosocial factors, including SES, level of acculturation, and maternal levels of depression and social support. Four major findings emerged. First, Latino mothers did not experience significant difficulty understanding DSM-IV symptoms of ADHD or ODD and the way they perceive these behaviors is largely consistent with the respective clinical disorders. Second, parental responses to clinical levels of ADHD and ODD behaviors were linked to external versus internal causal attributions across both disorders. Third, parental socialization goals, which reflected strong values on educational/professional goal attainment and positive interpersonal skills, were associated with reported parental responses to ADHD and ODD, respectively. Finally, there were trend differences in results by level of SES. The theoretical model that emerged from this study extends existing models related to parental beliefs, parenting, and help-seeking behavior. Findings suggest important clinical implications with respect to assessing ADHD and ODD among Latino children and engaging Latino parents into parenting and school-based interventions. Results of this study will inform future research and intervention-development efforts ultimately aimed at increasing mental health service use and improving outcomes among Latino children.

Only a few studies have addressed mental illness stigma in Africa, and they tend to be non-representative. Using a population-based sample of 1,550 adults from the Stigma in Global Context-Mental Health Study, this study applies the Etiology and Effects of Stigma Model to frame and evaluate mental illness stigma in South Africa. Analyses investigate causal attributes, stigma, and the links between them, taking into account how demographics structure both. Findings show that causal attributions are complex and that mental illness stigma exists in South Africa with schizophrenia drawing more stigma than depression. South Africans are hesitant to engage people with mental illness in marital relations and childcare. For the most part, social-demographic characteristics of persons described with mental illness are not associated with stigma. However, Blacks stand out as recipients of negative White responses. Gender is only significant when interacted with selected causal attributions. For example, males who endorse normal ups and down as cause of illness are more intolerant than females. Biogenetic causes are associated with intolerance, while non-biogenetic attributes reveal tolerant attitudes. Further, Black, male, and lowly educated respondents are more likely to endorse non-biogenetic causes for mental illness. In sum, the South African context is not unique; however, unlike other past studies, race and ethnicity matter. This is not surprising given South Africa’s history of apartheid and its vestiges that have structured interaction and development of the nation’s diverse racial groups. Corresponding to the Etiology and Effects of Stigma Model, causal attributions and selected socio-demographic characteristics influence mental illness stigma in South Africa. The respondents’ race has direct influence while gender is indirectly related to stigma. Internal attributions lead to increased stigma while externalized causes are associated with more tolerance. This study extends stigma work to non-western contexts and advances our general knowledge of disease stigma in Africa.

Research has documented ethnic differences in (1) parents’ beliefs about the seriousness, prognosis, and etiology of child symptoms and (2) preferences for help-seeking, which may partially explain disparities in treatment utilization; however, few studies have examined underlying cultural factors that may account for ethnic differences or parent’s beliefs and preferences with regard to youth anxiety. This study examined parents’ beliefs about separation anxiety disorder (SAD) and preferences for help-seeking among 117 Indian-American (IA; n = 39), Puerto Rican (PR; n = 39), and European-American (EA; n = 39) mothers. After reading four vignettes describing SAD symptoms, parents rated the seriousness, prognosis, and etiology of symptoms and the likelihood of help-seeking. Parents also completed measures of acculturation, independent/interdependent self-construal, and strength of religious faith. RM-MANCOVA (controlling for SES) revealed that PR mothers were more likely than EA mothers to endorse medical etiology and were more likely than IA mothers to seek help from a physician. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that acculturation and strength of religious faith predicted parents’ etiological beliefs and preferences for help-seeking, after accounting for variance associated with SES and child gender. Results highlight the importance of examining cultural constructs that may contribute to ethnic differences. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

Subjects and methods: Cross-sectional data from 163 relatives were collected in interviews, while data on 158 patients were collected by analyzing clinical charts. The following areas were assessed: socio-demographic and illness-related features of the patients, socio-demographic features of the relatives (environmental variables); sense of coherence, mastery, causal attributions and opinions of relatives about mental disorders (person variables); interpersonal problems with the patients as well as the assessment of their symptoms by the relatives themselves (primary appraisal); support received, critical life events and burden of relatives caused by their own illnesses (secondary appraisal); control behavior and efforts of relatives to engage the patients in activities (coping). PD was assessed with the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire. Bi-variate correlation analysis and a multiple linear regression model were the main test statistical approaches. Results: Correlation analysis showed that differences between diagnostic groups referred to primary and secondary appraisal processes, in particular. Results of the statistical model provided evidence for the importance of primary appraisal and person variables for influencing PD, and for the lack of importance of coping and environmental variables. Conclusion: The study enhanced the validity of the transactional stress model to demonstrate the influence of salutogenetic concepts such as sense of coherence.

We establish the state of current research on public attitudes towards alcohol dependent people. Methods: In an extensive search of the literature, we identified 49 population studies on this topic between 1948 and 2008. 27 studies contained relevant information from Western countries and were included in this review. Results: Although most people regard alcoholism as an illness, there is a strong tendency to blame those affected for their condition. Psycho-social causal attributions prevail over biologic explanations. Most people regard alcohol dependent persons as unpredictable and dangerous. The desire for social distance is stronger towards alcohol dependent persons than towards those with other psychiatric diagnoses such as depression or schizophrenia; only those addicted to illegal drugs suffer stronger rejection. Preferences of the public for resource allocation within the health care system put alcohol dependent patients at a potential disadvantage. Conclusions: Alcoholism is a severely stigmatized condition. In order to change the stigma of alcoholism, studies exploring theoretical models and mechanisms of stigmatization seem necessary.

The historical circumstances leading to the widespread acceptance of PTSD among conventional mental health professionals, and the subsequent criticisms that emerged from scholars, humanitarian workers, and ethnocultural minorities are presented as an important background to the current controversial status of the concept, especially with regard to arguments regarding the ethnocultural determinants of PTSD. The concept of culture, its definition, and its developmental socialization process, are presented as foundations for understanding the many influences cultural variables have on the perception, experience, clinical expressions, and treatment responses to trauma. A 'trauma event-person ecology' model identifies the different factors that serve to shape the outcome of trauma within and across cultures. A therapy outcome equation is presented that summarizes the complex calculus of variables and considerations impacting different outcomes. The many healing principles used by different Western and traditional approaches are also identified, calling attention to the importance of fitting patient to therapist to therapy to present and past circumstances. The article concludes that in spite of what appears to be common neurological processes, correlates, and consequences in the initial response to trauma exposure, ethnocultural variables exercise major influence on perceived causes, symptom manifestations, clinical parameters (i.e., onset, course, and outcome), interventions, and societal responses.

The study investigates the relationships between abused women’s causal attributions for violence, coping strategies, and PTSD outcomes. Approximately 793 women were approached outside of either a battered women’s shelter or the District Court, resulting in the recruitment of 406 primarily low-income, ethnic minority abused women. Only data from the 324 women who completed the baseline and identified themselves as African American were used in this study. Women’s causal attributions related to intentionality (intentional versus incidental violence) were regressed on six categories of coping strategies (placating, resistance, formal help source, informal help source, safety planning, and legal strategies) and on three clusters of PTSD symptoms (intrusion, avoidance, and arousal). Finally, regressions were conducted to determine how women’s coping strategies were related to their PTSD outcomes. It was found that Intentional attributions predicted significant distress associated with all three clusters of PTSD symptoms while Incidental attributions did not significantly predict distress related to any of the PTSD clusters. Passive coping strategies, namely, placating and informal help source coping strategies, also predicted distress related to PTSD. Attributions did not significantly predict abused women’s coping strategies. The author concludes that how abused women interpret and react to the violence they experience plays a substantial role in their mental health outcomes. Findings show the clinical relevance of women’s coping trajectories for understanding IPV. The manuscript also discusses how women’s ethnic minority status and cultural beliefs affect women’s interpretation and reaction to violence.

Case vignettes depicted symptoms of major depression and schizophrenia (Kumar & Nevid, 2010). Results revealed that case vignettes of schizophrenia elicited greater levels of endorsement of mental illness labeling, perceived weakness, and stereotyping as violent to others in comparison to case vignettes of depression. Responses to female case vignettes were associated with lower levels of social distance and stereotyping as violent to self than responses to male case vignettes. Our findings indicated that stereotyping as weak mediated the relationship between labeling and social distance. Greater endorsement of spiritual causal attributions of mental illness and traditional gender role beliefs elicited lesser endorsement of mental illness labeling, stereotyping as weak, and social distance, than lesser endorsement of spiritual causal attributions and traditional gender role beliefs. However, greater endorsement of spiritual causal attributions and traditional gender role beliefs was also associated with relatively greater levels of stereotyping as violent. Subsequent analyses indicated that mental illness labeling moderated the relationships between spiritual causal attributions, stereotyping as weak and violent, and social distancing, as well as the relationships between traditional gender role beliefs, stereotyping as weak and violent and social distancing.

Disparities in access to and quality of mental health care for Latino immigrants in the United States are well documented. Lack of insurance and language barriers provide only a partial explanation for these inequities. Illness cognitions, including causal beliefs about depression may influence health care utilization and illness outcomes, but have not been well examined in previous research. Moreover, identification and treatment of depression may be difficult for primary care providers due to cultural differences in presentation of symptoms. The purposes of this cross-sectional study are: to explore causal attributions about depression; to identify psychosocial factors associated with these beliefs; and to describe the self-reported symptoms, illness labels and cultural idioms of distress of Latino primary care patients. Methods. We interviewed 177 primary care patients with instruments to assess causal beliefs, depressive and somatic symptoms, ethnic identity and stigma. An exploratory factor analysis of the Causal Beliefs scale yielded three factors, 'Balance,' 'Psychosocial' and 'Malevolent Spirituality/Transgressions' that were used as dependent variables in multivariate analyses. Results. Both psychological and religious (spiritual) explanations of illness were strongly endorsed by these respondents. Depressive symptoms, age, country of origin and religiosity were significant predictors of causal beliefs. Those with higher education were most likely to endorse Psychosocial and Balance causation beliefs. Stigma pertained to causal beliefs related to 'malevolent forces' and 'personal transgressions.' Participants' descriptions of symptoms had a predominantly somatic component. The most common complaints were ánimo bajo (low energy) and decaimiento (weakness). Conclusions. Latino respondents in primary care endorse a dual system of Western-medicine and traditional causation beliefs about depression. These results suggest culturally-specific interventions for improving health literacy as well as strategies for improving communication with patients about depression. To enhance treatment of depression in the primary care setting, it is important to take into account culturally accepted expressions of distress, and the meaning of illness for the individual.

One hundred and forty seven female participants between the ages of 18 and 54 (M = 23.84) completed this study; 87.8% of participants identified as Caucasian. Six hypotheses were tested; the main hypothesis of interest assessed if causal and/or responsibility attribution style would mediate the relationship between CSA and dysfunctional sexuality when controlling for covariates (substance use/psychopathology and emotion dysregulation). Results demonstrated that attribution style did not mediate the relationship between CSA and dysfunctional sexuality; however, attribution style did account for significant portions of variance in predicting dysfunctional sexuality. For example, causal attribution style (a) significantly predicted internal sexual control (which was not predicted by CSA and covariates), (b) accounted for a significant portion of variance in predicting sexual anxiety above/beyond CSA and covariates, and (c) accounted for a significant portion of variance in predicting decreased sexual motivation with women reporting higher levels of CSA. Responsibility attribution style significantly predicted internal sexual control (which was not significantly predicted by CSA and covariates) and accounted for a significant portion of variance over/above CSA and covariates in predicting sexual anxiety and sexual depression. Additionally, results demonstrated that substance use/psychopathology mediated the link between CSA and dysfunctional sexuality, specifically sexual preoccupation, sexual anxiety, and sexual depression. Results suggest that female CSA survivors who use substances, report psychological symptoms, and make maladaptive attributions for negative partner behaviors are at risk for negative outcomes regarding sexual behaviors and attitudes. Limitations include the self-report design of the study, as some participants noted that several items were confusing or ambiguous, the use of online sampling (e.g., missing data), and significant skewness/kurtosis of several study variables. Additionally, this study questioned participants on experiences that may have been aversive and/or distressing; thus, participants’ responses to these items may have been influenced due to the nature of the items.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients diagnosed with SFDs tend towards a predominantly somatic attribution style. Methods: We compared the causal illness attributions of 48 SFD and 149 non-somatoform disorder patients, in a sample of patients presenting for an allergy diagnostic work-up, and those of 47 controls hospitalised for allergen-specific venom immunotherapy. The SFD diagnosis was established by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Both spontaneous and prompted causal illness attributions were recorded through interview and by means of the causal dimension of the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R), respectively. Patients' spontaneous and prompted responses were assigned to a psychosocial, somatic, or mixed attribution style. Results: Both in the free-response task and in their responses to the IPQ-R, SFD patients were no more likely than their nonsomatoform counterparts to focus on somatic explanations for their symptoms. They were just as likely to make psychosocial or mixed causal attributions. However, patients with SFDs were significantly more likely to find fault with medical care in the past. Conclusion: Our data do not support the use of somatic causal illness attributions as positive criteria for SFDs. They confirm the dynamic and multidimensional nature of causal illness attributions.

The paper addresses a very relevant topic. Causal attributions were recorded with two methods: an interview (spontaneous recall) and the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire IPQ-R (prompted recall). Two aspects appear noteworthy to comment on. First, results show that subjects with somatoform disorders (SFDs) do not hold simplistic, monocausal illness attribution assumptions, but consider multiple causes as relevant to their symptoms. Overall, these findings are in line with some previous findings showing a considerable degree of mixed attributions in SFD even though a predominant somatic attribution style can be identified. Second, the authors shows that SFD patients were no more likely than non-SFD patients to exhibit somatic explanations for their symptoms. The authors conclude that somatic causal attributions should not be used as a positive criterion for future classifications as it lacks specificity. Actually, the current study does not provide support that a somatic causal attribution style has sufficient discriminant validity to qualify for a diagnostic criterion. Therefore, it is important that further prospective studies are performed to assess the relevance of symptom interpretation styles and of other psychological criteria and to investigate their impact on the course of the disorder — resulting in stronger empirical evidence for the selection of diagnostic criteria.

Despite urban refugees constituting more than half of the world's refugees, minimal attention has been paid to their psychosocial wellbeing. The purpose of this study was to assess coping behaviour and aspects of resilience amongst refugees in Kathmandu, Nepal.; Methods: This study examined the experiences of 16 Pakistani and 8 Somali urban refugees in Kathmandu, Nepal through in-depth individual interviews, focus groups, and Photovoice methodology. Such qualitative approaches enabled us to broadly discuss themes such as personal experiences of being a refugee in Kathmandu, perceived causes of psychosocial distress, and strategies and resources for coping. Thematic network analysis was used in this study to systematically interpret and code the data.; Results: Our findings highlight that urban refugees' active coping efforts, notwithstanding significant adversity and resulting distress, are most frequently through primary relationships. Informed by Axel Honneth's theory on the struggle for recognition, findings suggest that coping is a function beyond the individual and involves the ability to negotiate recognition. This negotiation involves not only primary relationships, but also the legal order and other social networks such as family and friends. Honneth's work was used because of its emphasis on the importance of legal recognition and larger structural factors in facilitating daily coping.; Conclusions: Understanding how urban refugees cope by negotiating access to various forms of recognition in the absence of legal-recognition will enable organisations working with them to leverage such strengths and develop relevant programmes. In particular, building on these existing resources will lead to culturally compelling and sustainable care for these populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included"", ""Kelly""=>""Included"", ""Consensus""=>""Included""}",,Nepal,,

Causal beliefs, their underlying properties, and distinctive links to emotions form the foundation for these theories, which suggest a thinking-feeling-action sequence as the 'deep structure' for motivated behavior.

Brookes Publishing Co.,"Fisher, Sylvia K., Office of Research and Evaluation, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 10-49, Rockville, MD, US, 20857","Institutionalized heterosexism, biphobia, transphobia, and discriminatory treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth, as well as inadequate access to culturally and linguistically responsive resources, have resulted in considerable disparities in services and supports for LGBT youth. These social inequities can exacerbate behavioral health challenges because youth do not receive appropriate care from the systems and individuals they and their families turn to for support during times of need. Systems of care provide an organizing framework and a set of values for how communities can deliver effective mental health services and supports to children, youth, and their families. This book has adopted a public health approach to highlight how system of care communities and individuals can apply system of care principles and values to ensure that these systems are 'good fits' for LGBT youth and their families. In addition to providing a blueprint for approaches to services and supports in systems of care to enhance outcomes for LGBT youth, this book has raised significant issues and advanced several concepts (e.g., assets-based approaches to services and research; LGBT-affirming clinical interventions; culturally and linguistically competent approaches to service delivery for youth who are LGBT, two-spirit, or have differences in sexual development; guidelines for working with LGBT headed families).'We anticipate that the content of this book will support the efforts of others to identify and implement additional promising strategies and effective approaches. Youth participating in systems of care may exhibit large individual differences in their degree of exposure to institutionalized heterosexism, transphobia, fear, stigma, adversity, and violence. Many, if not most, LGBT youth have experienced trauma and may benefit from a trauma-informed approach to the delivery of services and supports from entry into services and throughout their tenure in systems of care. Accordingly, those building systems of care and individual service providers working with LGBT youth should address the impact of sociocultural development and factors associated with the youth, family, and community in all aspects of their planning, outreach, assessments, and interventions. Furthermore, Lazear and Gamache point out the importance of addressing the benefits of LGBT-specific assets and resources as well as the effects of negative life events, sociocultural aspects of the clinician-patient interaction, help-seeking behaviors and coping styles, stigma and other social stressors, and perceived causes of symptoms and behaviors. Despite these challenges, LGBT youth who experience multiple challenges are often fiercely resilient and resourceful, and it is critical to capitalize on the strengths these youth demonstrate.

Employing the framework of the attribution model (Corrigan, Markowitz, Watson, Rowan & Kubiak, 2003; Weiner, 1985), the current study examined whether attribution theory could be applied in Chinese culture to understand Chinese college students' attitude towards people with mental illness. In addition, an alternative severity model was proposed to explain possible psychological mechanisms influencing severity appraisal and mental illness stigma. Using an experimental design with hypothetical vignettes, the relationships between causal attributions (e.g., controllability, responsibility), severity, emotional responses (e.g., pity, fear, shame-anger), and helping and coercive responses were estimated in a sample of 293 college students from two universities in China. Results from the hierarchical regression analyses only partially supported the attribution model. Consistent with attribution theory, the causes of mental illness affected responsibility beliefs, which, in turn, led to emotional responses that influenced willingness to help. However, when coercion was the outcome variable, the findings did not support the attribution model as the effect of responsibility was not mediated by the controllability of cause. Consistent with a severity hypothesis, the effects of severity on both helping and coercion were not mediated by responsibility beliefs, but operated directly via shame-anger and fear. Severity was also found to moderate the relationship between helping and coercion. Overviews of the conceptual and methodological limitations in applying the attribution model to study mental illness stigma in China as well as practical implications for stigma reduction intervention, and directions for future research are discussed. This research contributes to the ongoing knowledge pertaining to mental illness stigma and identification of culturally specific factors, mechanisms, and processes associated with stigma towards persons with mental illness in China, thus providing valuable insights into the development of culturally-sensitive anti-stigma interventions.

This study utilized grounded theory to address this deficiency and provide a theoretical framework of transitional stages that captures the developmental course of this phenomenon as it is endured by community mental health counselors. Five distinct but related themes emerged which represent psychological phases the participants encountered as burnout progressed. These were vulnerability, inconsistent self, questioning competency, negative perspicacity, and loss of meaning. The results of this study indicate that this phenomenon is, to an extent, self-made through cognitive appraisals that are associated with the psychological process of burnout. The ongoing interplay between a demanding environment and burnout symptoms appears to be mediated by the nature of these appraisals involving causal attributions and evaluations of the significance of one's work. The narrative data revealed burnout begins and is sustained by negative interpretations of job experiences and a persistent focus on causes which eventually lead to a profound loss of meaning. It is suggested that interventions to address this phenomenon consider ways to help counselors shift their focus from negative causal attributions to rediscovering the intrinsic value of their work through meaning-focused coping strategies. Newly emerging research and the results of the present study affirm the value of studying burnout through an existential perspective.

Sanders et al. (see record [rid]2011-10141-009[/rid]). We read with interest the paper by Sanders and colleagues investigating the perceptions of schizophrenia among Māori and non-Māori. It is pleasing to see research that attempts to give voice to the experience and views of tangata whaiora regarding their illnesses and future. However, the presentation and interpretation of the findings in this study raise some concerns. The authors introduce historical Māori views of mental illness such as described by Te Rangi Hiroa in the early 20th century and appear to intimate the renaissance of Māori culture may mean a return to these beliefs about mental illness and may subsequently contribute to reduced medication compliance. This assumption pervades the title, discussion and conclusions despite their results demonstrating the general lack of difference between Māori and non Māori views. While the potential selection bias is acknowledged this warrants highlighting. The sample consisted of 68 Māori who were all high users of mental health services, with unknown duration of illness, interviewed by mental health consumers with a response rate as low as 55% to the causal beliefs question. Furthermore the causal beliefs section is described as open-ended and would have been better presented using a qualitative research method. Concluding that 'differences between Māori and New Zealand European patients' beliefs about mental illness may be related to Māori traditional beliefs about mental illness' seems an exaggeration of the generalizability of this study given these concerns, along with the results failing to demonstrate this difference. If this study had been presented as 'Māori and non-Māori shared attitudes to medication' and the positive attitudes to medication emphasized, this may have aided combating some psychiatrists' views such as 'Māori just don't take medication' as previously identified in research in this journal.

Only a few Indian studies have focused on help seeking, especially for severe mental disorders.; Objective: The study aimed to describe and compare the help-seeking behaviors among caregivers of psychotic patients visiting psychiatric clinics at two distinct cities of India.; Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional exploratory study of key caregivers (N=50) of patients with a DSM-IV TR diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, visiting psychiatric out-patient departments of VIMHANS, New Delhi, and CIMS, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh. After due informed consent was taken, a semi-structured proforma was administered for socio-demographic profile, illness details, causative beliefs, and information on help seeking.; Results: Supernatural forces were held responsible by 40% of the Bilaspur sample in contrast to 8% in New Delhi sample.

Two-thirds of sample in New Delhi and one-third at Bilaspur were aware of the nearby psychiatrist at the time of initial help seeking; however, only 28% and 12%, respectively, chose psychiatrist as an initial contact. The New Delhi sample reported a fear of medication adverse effects and stigma as perceived disadvantages of psychiatric help. The median time lost at both the centers was 1 month, with a maximum of 8.4 years in New Delhi and 4.9 years in Bilaspur. Of the total, 16% caregivers at New Delhi and 32% at Bilaspur center reported an intention to continue with faith-healing practices alongside psychiatric care.; Conclusion: In spite of differing causal attributions, the patients and families across these cities may not be as different when it comes to behaviors related to help seeking for mental illness.

Meaning units were extracted and condensed into a number of codes, which were combined into subcategories, categories, and themes. Four themes were identified: 1) Long-term oral, mental, and somatic difficulties of varying character, caused by dental amalgam. 2) Problems treated mainly by replacement of dental material in fillings. 3) Powerful effects on life, mostly negative. 4) The reception by health professionals was generally good, but with elements of encounters where they felt treated with nonchalance and lack of respect. In conclusion, people who attributed their health difficulties to dental materials had a complex range of problems and the perception was that amalgam/mercury was the cause of the troubles.

To navigate in social environments efficiently, people have to think about themselves and others frequently and to understand themselves and others correctly. The processing of social information about oneself and others, referred to as social cognition, provides a basis for appropriate social behaviors and an avenue to achieve social goals. An important feature of social cognition is context dependence—that is, what and how social information is processed relies heavily on whom an individual interacts with and in which social context such interactions occur. Based on cross-cultural comparisons, psychological findings have formulated several variations of standard social cognitive processes in different cultural contexts, such as causal attribution, self-construals, and affect valuation. Cross-cultural variation in social cognition may reflect, to a certain degree, the difference in cognitive styles between different cultures. This chapter reviews previous psychological findings of cross-cultural variations in social cognition and recent brain imaging findings of cross-cultural variations in the neural substrates underlying social cognition. This literature review outlines what aspects of social cognition vary across cultures and to what degree the underlying neural mechanisms are shaped by sociocultural contexts.

In developing countries, a vast majority of people attributed psychiatric symptoms to supernatural phenomena, drug use, stressful life events, heredity or personality deficiencies and accordingly sought treatment from various avenues. Methods: One hundred twenty consecutive consenting patients accompanied by a reliable informant/family member fulfilling the ICD-10 criteria of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders, mood disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, somatization and dissociative disorders were included in the study. Sociodemographic and clinical proforma of all the eligible subjects was filled in. Perceived causes of illness and help seeking pattern were explored from the informant by administering proper instrument. Results: Respondents identified a mean of 2.78 (± 0.87 SD) causes of psychiatric disorders in their relatives and explored a mean of 2.8 (± 1.51 SD) help seeking options before reaching tertiary care center. The majority (96.8%) of the relatives of patients’ with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders believed in supernatural causation whereas, majority of the relatives of subjects with depressive disorder (34.6%), OCD and other anxiety disorders (80%), somatization or dissociative disorders (61.5%) attributed their relatives’ symptom to excessive worrying/thinking. Majority of the subjects across all four diagnostic categories sought non-professional medical help. Preference for religious remedies (54.8% of subjects with schizophrenia and 100% of subjects with OCD-anxiety disorders) and alternative medicine (80% of the subjects with OCD-anxiety disorders) were also noticed. Across all four diagnostic categories belief in causes other than bodily pathology predicted help seeking from various quarters except for professional medical help whereas symptom attribution to bodily pathology predicted professional help seeking in OCD-anxiety disorder group. In the schizophrenia group, people who believed in psychological causation were more likely to be from higher income group; whereas those who sought professional medical help were more likely to be educated. Conclusion: A wide variety of indigenous beliefs exist in Indo-Pak subcontinent which is in conflict with biomedical models of these psychiatric disorders.

They likely influence the family's help-seeking decisions and affect both adherence with biomedical interventions and social integration of the patients. The aim of this study was to describe Tunisian families’ beliefs about the causes, the symptoms and the treatments of schizophrenia. Methods: We led a transversal study including 91 relatives of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV). We excluded patients with mental retardation or neurological diseases. For family members, we excluded participants with a history of mental disorders or cognitive impairments. We collected basic socio-demographic data for both patients and relatives. We asked relatives to respond by 'yes/no/I am not certain' to a three-part questionnaire including 27 items dealing with causal explanations, symptoms and optimal cures for schizophrenia. Results: The mean age of the relatives was 49.8 (±13.7) years; 54.9% were men; 49.4% were parents, 8.8% spouses, 39.6% brothers or sisters; 25.3% had not attended school, 24.2% had attended primary school, 37.4% junior high school or high school and 13.2% had a university degree; 63.7% lived in an urban area; 33% had low economic status and 41.8% reported having another family member with mental disorder. Only 46.2% of participants had asked psychiatrists about the diagnosis of their sick relatives and only 16.5% were able to label the term 'schizophrenia'. Among the cited etiologies of schizophrenia, religious causes were found in 76.9% of cases, they first cited God's will or fate and secondly God's punishment. Magical explanations such as witchcraft and possession by 'djinns' were found in 47.3% of cases. The biological causes were cited by 59.3% of participants. The majority of participants (95.6%) proved the need for drugs and 81.3% the utility of psychotherapies. However, 30.8% believed in non-medical practices such as reading Holy Koran verses, charity and exorcism. Significant correlations were found between relatives’ low level of education, low economic status, living in a rural area and supernatural beliefs, traditional practices, stigma and the use of the term ‘madness’. Significant correlations were also found between family history of mental disorders and beliefs on family and hereditary causes. Conclusion: In this study, opinions and attitudes regarding schizophrenia were related to education level, economic status and geographic origin. Few persons recognized the term 'schizophrenia' despite a long contact with the mental health system. This fact points out the need to improve the psychoeducation of family members of persons with schizophrenia.

We conducted an online study of 84 participants with a self-reported psychotic disorder and performed a path analysis. More insight into the need for treatment, a higher attribution of the symptoms to a mental disorder, experience of less negative side effects, presence of biological causal beliefs, and less endorsement of psychological causal beliefs were significant predictors of more positive attitudes towards medication. The results largely supported the postulated process model.

It is important to recognize clients' unique cultural contexts and the resulting 'lens' in which they view the world. This shared 'lens' of perception includes how people define illness, including mental health disorders and the perceived causes, as well as the accepted modalities of treatments. This is true with individuals from various religious cultures. Religion can be a potent web of influence and can create shared meanings that shape worldviews. This is true of Pentecostals who espouse a specific worldview that lends itself to a unique cultural lens of understanding mental health disorders. Their worldview is complex, and embraces the natural realm while highly valuing the spiritual realm. They believe that the Holy Spirit is an active integral part of their lives. As such, they believe that divine healing from illness is attainable if God wills it so. These beliefs in the supernatural, as well as ways they are lived out, are important to consider when discussing views regarding their beliefs regarding causes and treatments of mental health disorders. They also highly value the role of the clergy and often turn to them for help with mental health problems. The goal of this study was to explore the Apostolic Pentecostal clergy's beliefs regarding mental health disorders within the context of their unique spiritual worldview. Seven Apostolic Pentecostal clergy were interviewed via a semi-structured telephone interview. The results found that Apostolic Pentecostal clergy viewed biological and psychosocial determinants as causes of mental health disorders.They endorsed professional counseling and medication with concurrent pastoral care to address the whole person. Treatment was viewed in the context of healing. They believed that God could heal any problem instantly, or in a gradual healing process that incorporates the clergy and counselors working together with the help of the Holy Spirit. The clergy saw their role as providing spiritual care while supporting parishioners as they received concurrent mental health care. Clergy embraced collaboration with counselors, with a preference for counselors who believed in God. Clergy reported that negating the importance of the spiritual realm or going against their faith-based practices would create problems for them, as well as their parishioners. Clergy indicated that it was important for counselors to know that Apostolic Pentecostals operate within a strong faith-based worldview. In addition, they wanted counselors to know that they embrace education and outside help in addition to the working of the Holy Spirit and pastoral care in treating mental health disorders. However, their parishioners may have difficulty asking for help based on past teaching that asserted that if one had God's Spirit, they would not need outside help. The results indicate that the Apostolic Pentecostal clergy held shared beliefs regarding causes and treatments of mental health disorders, as well as those they trusted to address these issues. In addition, the results display significant differences from past research with Pentecostals. Implications for counseling and future research are discussed.

Akan, the largest ethnic group in Ghana, is noted for the use of supernatural attributions for various health-related issues. The supernatural attributions are based on Akan ontological belief that the universe is unitary such that there is no clear distinction between physical and spiritual occurrences. This worldview guides Akans in how they deal with a wide range of issues including their mental health. Clinicians and other mental health professionals who rely solely on biomedical approaches to mental health fail to meet the demands of Akan mental health help-seekers because such approaches do not recognize the cultural factors that inform lay understandings on mental illness. Limited studies have been conducted on how Akan supernatural attributions influence conceptualizations of mental illness. Using a grounded theory method of research, 14 individual interviews and 7 focus group interviews were conducted to explore beliefs and knowledge about mental illness in two indigenous Akan communities in Ghana. Participants were of diverse age, sex, education, and occupational background. Analysis revealed that cultural factors influence lay conceptions, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. Local labels for mental illness as well as beliefs about etiology, development, and cure of mental illness were identified. It was found that the Akan unitary worldview aids in the endorsement of heterogeneous multi-tier causal attributions of mental illness that embrace supernatural and non-supernatural causal explanations. Although supernatural causality theories of mental illness existed, participants related a complex causal explanation that involved other non-supernatural causal attributions. Results further revealed that Akan cultural beliefs influence community response to mental illness, encouraging pluralistic help-seeking behaviors that satisfy the Akan cultural value for holistic treatment and care. The implications of the findings for clinical training, culturally-sensitive mental health practice, and mental health education and advocacy have been discussed.

The present study set out to assess the role of gender in influencing staff emotions, attributions and behavioural intentions in response to aggression displayed by adults with ID. Method: A new scale measuring staff behavioural intentions was developed. A two × two (staff gender × service user gender) between subjects design was used to compare the responses of day and residential support staff to physical aggression by a hypothetical service user. In response to a vignette depicting a service user with ID assaulting a member of staff, 160 respondents completed measures of affective responses, causal attributions and behavioural intentions while imagining themselves as the target of the service user’s assault. Results: Female participants reported feeling more fear/anxiety, more depression/anger and less confident/relaxed than male participants. The longer staff had worked with people with ID, the more likely they were to favour safety-focused behaviours. More confident female participants were less likely to favour safety-focused behaviours, but confidence had no effect on male participants’ endorsement of these behaviours. Increased confidence in both was associated with lower agreement of safety-focused behaviours in relation to the female vignette, regardless of participant gender. The more control women believed the service user had over their behaviour, the more likely they were to choose safety-focused behaviours. Punitive behaviours were favoured more in response to the male rather than the female service user. Punitive behaviours were also favoured more by more junior staff and by participants who expected feeling more depressed/angry in response to the vignettes. Conclusions: Both staff and service user gender influenced staff responses to aggression, yet the latter played a smaller role than expected. The role of gender in staff–service user interactions should be the focus of further research and should be considered in service delivery.

Several previous studies reported that mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced L100P mutation in Disc1 showed some schizophrenia-related behavioral phenotypes. This line originally carried several thousands of ENU-induced point mutations in the C57BL/6 J strain and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the DBA/2 J inbred strain.Methods: To investigate the effect of Disc1 L100P, background mutations and SNPs on phenotypic characterization, we performed behavioral analyses to better understand phenotypes of Disc1 L100P mice and comprehensive genetic analyses using whole-exome resequencing and SNP panels to map ENU-induced mutations and strain-specific SNPs, respectively.Results: We found no differences in spontaneous or methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity, sociability or social novelty preference among Disc1 L100P/L100P, L100P/+ mutants and wild-type littermates. Whole-exome resequencing of the original G1 mouse identified 117 ENU-induced variants, including Disc1 L100P per se. Two females and three males from the congenic L100P strain after backcrossing to C57BL/6 J were deposited to RIKEN BioResource Center in 2008. We genotyped them with DBA/2 J × C57BL/6 J SNPs and found a number of the checked SNPs still remained.Conclusion: These results suggest that causal attribution of the discrepancy in behavioral phenotypes to the Disc1 L100P mutant mouse line existing among different research groups needs to be cautiously investigated in further study by taking into account the effect(s) of other ENU-induced mutations and/or SNPs from DBA/2 J.

In the United States, little is known about the psychological adjustment of South Asians, particularly Indian immigrants and first generation Indian American Christians. In this study, I investigated the effect of acculturation, ethnic identity, and religious commitment on stigma, etiological beliefs about common childhood and adolescent psychological disorders (attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and autism), and help-seeking attitudes in the Indian Orthodox population. Forty-six Indian immigrants and 64 first generation Indian Americans completed electronic or paper questionnaires assessing their level of acculturation, ethnic identity, and religious commitment. Participants also completed measures on stigma, help-seeking attitudes, and causal beliefs (biological, psychosocial, and spiritual). The results showed that religious commitment was negatively associated with stigma and positively associated with help-seeking attitudes. Participants who rated high on acculturation endorsed biological underpinning for ADHD, autism, depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse. Previous knowledge of mental illness was linked to fewer ratings of spiritual causes for ADHD, autism and depression, but religious commitment was associated with increased ratings of spiritual causes for alcohol abuse.

Culturally based illness beliefs influence help-seeking behavior and may provide insights into strategies for increasing utilization rates among vulnerable populations. This is the first large descriptive study of depressed Chinese American immigrant patients’ illness beliefs using a standardized instrument. 190 depressed Chinese immigrants seeking primary care at South Cove Community Health Center completed the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue, which probes different dimensions of illness beliefs: chief complaint, labeling of illness, stigma perception, causal attributions, and help-seeking patterns. Responses were sorted into categories by independent raters and results compared to an earlier study at the same site and using the same instrument. Contrary to prior findings that depressed Chinese individuals tend to present with primarily somatic symptoms, subjects were more likely to report chief complaints and illness labels related to depressed mood than physical symptoms. Nearly half reported they would conceal the name of their problem from others. Mean stigma levels were significantly higher than in the previous study. Most subjects identified psychological stress as the most likely cause of their problem. Chinese immigrants’ illness beliefs were notable for psychological explanations regarding their symptoms, possibly reflecting increased acceptance of Western biomedical frameworks, in accordance with recent research. However, reported stigma regarding these symptoms also increased. As Asian American immigrant populations increasingly accept psychological models of depression, stigma may become an increasingly important target for addressing disparities in mental health service utilization.

We hypothesized that older adults who attributed their suicidal behavior to thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness would be more likely to use more immediately lethal means and to re-attempt suicide during the 12-month follow-up. Design: Prospective cohort study in western Sweden. Participants: A total of 101 older adults who presented to medical emergency rooms for suicide attempts. Measurements: Participants were asked why they attempted suicide. Results: Attributions included: a desire to escape (N = 29), reduced functioning and autonomy (N = 24), psychological problems, including depression (N = 24), somatic problems and physical pain (N = 16), perceived burdensomeness (N = 13), social problems that reflected either thwarted belongingness or family conflict (N = 13), and lack of meaning in life (N = 8); 41 participants provided more than one reason. No specific reason was given by 28 participants, 15 of whom reported not understanding or remembering why they attempted suicide and 13 reported simply wanting to die (or go to sleep and not wake up). As hypothesized, patients who attributed the attempt to thwarted belongingness were more likely to use more immediately lethal means for their index attempt and were more likely to re-attempt during follow-up. This was not the case for those reporting burdensomeness. Conclusion: People who attribute suicide attempts to thwarted belongingness use more lethal methods and have a poorer prognosis. Replications across diverse cultural settings are needed to determine whether attributing suicide attempts to thwarted belongingness may warrant increased monitoring.

This article addresses how people think about different kinds of causal explanations in legal decision-making contexts. Three studies involving a total of 600 Mechanical Turk and university participants found that genetic, versus environmental, explanations of criminal behavior lead people to view the applicability of various defense claims differently, perceive the perpetrator's mental state differently, and draw different causal attributions. Moreover, mediation and path analyses highlight the double-edged nature of genetic attributions-they simultaneously reduce people's perception of the perpetrator's sense of control while increasing people's tendencies to attribute the cause to internal factors and to expect the perpetrator to reoffend. These countervailing relations, in turn, predict sentencing in opposite directions, although no overall differences in sentencing or ultimate verdicts were found.

Therefore, the current study sought to assess school nurses’ perspectives and practices related to chronic abdominal pain. A study invitation and link to a web-based questionnaire were sent to members of the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) with published e-mail addresses. A total of 1,550 school nurses (∼11% response rate) participated in the study. Approximately 1/3 of the sample reported >90 annual student visits for abdominal pain. Fifty-seven percent perceived the most common cause for childhood chronic abdominal pain as related to psychosocial issues. Although psychosocial issues were the most commonly perceived cause of pain, 66% of nurses reported collaborating with mental health professionals <10% of the time. Half of the nurses sampled were not confident in their understanding of chronic abdominal pain in children, and 27% perceived nursing education available on the topic to be nonexistent or poor. School nurses frequently see children with abdominal pain, primarily believe psychosocial/behavioral issues to account for it (although rarely collaborate with mental health professionals), and know little about biological contributors to and classification of the condition. These findings indicate a need for an evidence-based curriculum for school nurse training.

Background: Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a chronic gastrointestinal tract disorder affecting 3% to 14% of patients experiencing unexplained nausea and vomiting who were referred to health centers in the United States. Patients experience frequent cycles of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain placing them at risk for life-threatening health complications. These incapacitating episodes impact social, emotional, and physical health, however minimal research has focused on descriptions of illness perception, life impact, and response to treatment. Methods: Purposive sampling was used in this phenomenological study to recruit 16 adults, 21 years or older with a diagnosis of CVS for more than one year. Data were collected electronically via Survey MonkeyRTM. Type-written data was analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison techniques. Demographic data, also collected electronically, was described using Excel. Results: All 16 participants were Caucasian. Eleven were female and five were male. Participants ranged in age from 22 to 59 years at the time of the study. Six participants were classified as having pediatric-onset CVS and 10 were classified as having adult-onset CVS. Seven global themes emerged from the data: (a) perceived causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome, (b) triggers for CVS episodes, (c) onset of illness and symptoms of CVS, (d) understanding the chronic course of CVS, (e) impact on day-to-day life, (f) lack of health care provider knowledge, and (g) responses to CVS-related treatments. Participants discussed limited understanding of illness etiology. However, they revealed understanding CVS as a chronic and cyclic illness. Emphasis was placed on triggers for CVS, life impact, lack of health care provider knowledge leading to diagnostic delay, avoidance of care, and inappropriate treatment. Prophylactic, abortive, and self-management was discussed. Discussions of emotional impact highlight the need for multidisciplinary care to insure that physical as well as mental health issues are considered and addressed. Findings present the need for increased CVS awareness and education to improve health care, access, and quality of care.

Attributions have traditionally been dichotomized along four dimensions based on their locus, controllability, specificity, and stability and have been associated with a wide variety of thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and actions related to mental illness. However, more recent studies have introduced a new cross-cultural model incorporating lay beliefs about the specific biological, emotional, social, and spiritual causes of mental health problems. The present research outlines the design and initial validation of a comprehensive, international measure of causal beliefs using this new model, the Mental Illness Attribution Questionnaire (MIAQ). The four-stage research project included item formulation, piloting, identification of factor structure, qualitative rating tasks, and initial validation with a sample of 680 international students representing 94 nations. Factors captured causes related to supernatural forces, social/stress, lifestyle, physical health, substance use, heredity/biology, and personal weakness. This structure was tested for model fit using confirmatory factor analysis across three vignette conditions -- one each describing a man with schizophrenia, depression, or alcoholism -- with further examination yielding strong test-retest reliability and promising convergent, discriminant, and cultural validity data. Taken together, these results provide tentative support for the reliability and validity of the MIAQ as a comprehensive measure of seven categories of mental illness attribution. The measure was validated using existing standards for international scale development and has strong potential for understanding attribution and stigmatizing behavior across cultures.

The results suggested that perceived stigma was significantly associated with several biogenetic, psychosocial, and personality explanations for both depression and schizophrenia. When respondents believed that psychosocial factors caused depression, they were less likely to perceive them as weak rather than sick. Believing that depression and schizophrenia were caused by personality characteristics was associated with stronger personal beliefs about the ill person’s dangerousness and unpredictability.

We used the 10 stigmata from the original study and we added 6 more (representing common psychological and physical stigmata). In the first study, we examined the classification of stigmata using cluster analysis. We found that instead of dichotomizing stigmata into either psychological or physical, attributions of controllability and stability together resulted in 4 distinct clusters. Although these were mostly consistent with past literature, the fourth cluster included both psychological and physical stigmata and was rated as moderately controllable and moderately stable. In the second study, we examined how information about responsibility shifts causal attributions, emotional responses, and helping behaviors. Information that an individual was responsible for their stigma led to greater attributions of controllability, less positive emotions, and less help compared with information that an individual was not responsible. More interestingly, the no-information control condition was similar to the responsibility information condition for stigmata that fell into the controllable clusters, whereas the control condition was similar to the not responsible information condition for stigmata that fell into the uncontrollable clusters. While parsimony is valued, the psychological/physical dichotomy is not nuanced enough to fully capture the variation in stigmata, which, in turn, has implications for future research on stigma reduction.

These individuals tend to be seen as dangerous, unreliable, and are perceived to have a poor prognosis, which is correlated with a desire for social distance (Griffiths et al., 2006; Angermeyer & Matschinger, 2003; Angermeyer et al., 2003). Research literature has shown that the most effective stigma-reduction strategy to date is direct contact between individuals from the general population and those from the stigmatized group (Corrigan et al., 2012). Although effective, it is not always feasible due to a variety of constraints such as ability or willingness of individuals to engage in contact. Therefore, this study proposed an alternative option: the hallucination simulation video. Participants were assigned to one of three groups: simulated experience, written description, or a control condition. Each group was provided with a different intervention, and then all participants were asked to complete measures designed to gauge their attitudes on a variety of variables. There were no significant differences found between groups regarding levels of empathy, desire for social distance, causal attributions of the illness, or perceived dangerousness. Although the written description group endorsed higher levels of emotional discomfort, this did not seem to affect other attitudes such as empathy or desire for social distance.

Yet, research to inform the mental health of UMIs is scant and existing studies often lack scientific rigor. This study used the Socio-Ecologic Framework and the Minority Stress Model, as well as context-sensitive methodology and Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) to identify the prevalence of psychological distress, mental health disorders, and relevant Cultural and Contextual Concepts of Distress, among UMIs living in high-risk neighborhoods near the California-Mexico border region. Design: This study was a multi-stage project that included formative research, pilot testing, and a cross-sectional study that used Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) as a sampling and data analysis methodology. Data for the RDS study was obtained from clinical interviews with 248 UMI adults of Mexican origin residing in North San Diego County. Primary mental health outcome measures included the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-53), and the Bradford Symptom Inventory (aBSI). An adapted version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) 5th Edition Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) was used for the assessment of Cultural and Contextual Concepts of Distress. Results: Overall, 41% of UMIs met criteria for clinically significant psychological distress, with significant differences found for sex, age, and marital status. Additionally, 22% of UMIs met criteria for one or more mental health disorder based on DSM diagnosis, with the most prevalent disorders being Major Depressive Disorder (MDD: 14%) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD: 7%). Pertaining to Cultural Concepts of Distress, 24% of UMIs reported a lifetime prevalence of Nervios and 12% reported a lifetime prevalence of Ataque de Nervios, with the most common causal attributions for Nervios and Ataque de Nervios being family conflict (20%). Moreover, 82% of UMIs reported experiencing significant distress as a result of their undocumented status, which was found to be associated with significant migration-related loss, clinically significant psychological and somatic symptoms, and a negative effect on identity and self-esteem. Conclusions: UMIs are a population at risk of psychological distress given the multiple contextual stressors that these immigrants face. Debates on programs and policies pertaining to UMIs are complex and multifaceted, and divisiveness on immigration and welfare reform in the U.S. is long-standing. Tenacious grassroots efforts, both, in Mexico and in the U.S., are necessary to influence policy aimed to allocate funding to increase access to culturally and contextually responsive interventions aimed to address the complex mental health needs of this vulnerable population. It is the responsibility of both Mexico and the U.S. to work collaboratively in the development of programs and policies to prevent the negative consequences of inadequate access and to protect the human rights of Mexican immigrants looking for more promising futures.

What neural correlates underlie the extraordinary cultural diversity of human behavior? How do our genes interact with sociocultural experiences to moderate human brain functional organization and behavior? The Sociocultural Brain provides a new perspective on human brain functional organization, highlighting the role of human sociocultural experience and its interaction with genes in shaping the human brain and behavior. Drawing on cutting edge research from the burgeoning field of cultural neuroscience, it reveals the cross-cultural differences in human brain activity that underlie a multitude of cognitive and affective processes, including visual perception/attention, memory, causal attribution, inference of others' mental states, self-reflection, and empathy. In addition, it presents studies that integrate brain imaging and cultural priming to explore the causal relationship between culture and brain functional organization. The book ends with a discussion of the implications of cultural neuroscience findings for understanding the nature of the human brain and culture, as well as the implications for education, cross-cultural communication and conflict, and the clinical treatment of mental disorders.

Antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are two of the most effective and widely used treatments for depression. Some research suggests that various causal attributions for depression may differentially effect treatment specific credibility and outcome expectancy. Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of biological and cognitive behavioral explanations on treatment credibility, outcome expectancy, and intentions to initiate antidepressant medication and CBT among a sample of participants meeting criteria for a current major depressive episode. Methods: The sample (N = 157) was recruited using Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd sourcing marketplace. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three active conditions describing their symptoms as being caused by biological, cognitive behavioral, multi-causal (combination of biological and cognitive behavioral), or a no-information control group. Next, participants read descriptions of antidepressant medication and CBT treatments. Following each description, participants completed measures of treatment credibility, outcome expectancy, and intention to initiate the treatment. Three separate 2 (antidepressant medication vs. CBT) x 4 (biological, cognitive behavioral, multi-causal, or no-information control) mixed model ANOVAs and a series of planned contrasts were used to examine group differences. Results: Treatment credibility was significantly greater in the CBT condition compared to the antidepressant medication condition, p = .007, across all explanatory conditions. However, there were no other significant main-effects of treatment condition or explanatory condition on treatment credibility, expectancy, of willingness to initiate treatment. Similarly, the interaction of treatment and explanatory conditions did not significantly predict treatment credibility, expectancy, or intention to initiate treatment, all p's > .05. Planned contrasts showed no significant differences in causal explanatory condition treatment credibility, expectancy, or willingness to initiate treatment for antidepressant medication or CBT, all p's > .05. Conclusion: Causal explanations had no impact on treatment credibility, outcome expectancy, or willingness to initiate either treatment for depression. Overall, participants reported very low willingness to initiate treatment for their depressive symptoms.

Adult participants (N = 644) resided in the United States and completed an online questionnaire through Amazon Mechanical Turk. The vignette study design was 3 (trauma type: military combat versus accident versus rape) x 2 (vignette character gender: male versus female) x 2 (participant gender: male versus female). It was hypothesized that PTSD literacy outcomes would be greatest for the military condition, followed by accident, followed by rape. Female participants were expected to have greater PTSD literacy than males. All participants were expected to recommend female vignette characters seek psychological help more than male characters. It was also hypothesized that blame would differ among trauma types and that anger and pity would mediate the relationships between blame and PTSD literacy attitudinal outcomes. The hypotheses were partially supported. Overall, the results reflected high levels of PTSD literacy in this sample. Personal mental health experience predicted greater PTSD literacy. Participants randomized to the military condition recognized that the vignettes depicted a mental health problem and PTSD with greater frequency than those in the other conditions. Participants in the rape condition recommended the vignette characters seek psychological help more than those in the other conditions. Compared to male participants, females indicated that the vignettes depicted more serious problems in functioning. There was a lack of findings for vignette character gender. No differences in character blame were found; thus, attribution theory was not supported as the explanatory mechanism for differences in PTSD literacy across conditions. However, anger and pity fully mediated the relationships between blame and willingness to help the character and blame and avoidance of the character regardless of condition; attribution theory was supported in this regard. Also, pity fully mediated the relationships between blame and degree of problem and blame and helpfulness of treatment. Future research should examine how other attributional biases may account for PTSD literacy differences among trauma types. Findings can be used to help training programs target populations low in PTSD literacy and highlight the effects of emotional reactions to PTSD on helping behaviors.

Although there are evidence-based therapies available to help children and their families, most youth do not receive treatment. Parental problem recognition is likely a primary barrier in this process. This study begins to address why parents may have difficulty recognizing mental health problems by extending existing models and integrating evidence about parental perceptions. Specifically, the study aimed to investigate the relationship between parental attributions and parents' problem determination, and to examine the influence that parental characteristics have on this judgment process. Participants included 164 parents of youth ages 6-11 years. Purposive sampling was used to recruit mothers and fathers from both lower and higher SES communities. Parents completed self-report measures of parental characteristics, including: parental psychopathology, parenting stress, parental tolerance, and parental self-efficacy. Parents read ten brief child behavior vignettes and completed a version of the Written Analogue Questionnaire to rate the cause of each behavior (assuming it was their own child in the vignette) along four dimensions. Parents also rated the extent to which the behavior was seen as a problem. Results indicated that parents' causal attributions were highly associated with parents' problem ratings, and the attributions of stability and controllability were particularly robust predictors of problem determination. Hypotheses regarding parental characteristics as moderators of the relationship between attributions and problem determination were not supported. Findings are discussed in light of clinical and public health implications; results suggest that recognizing the influence of parental beliefs and attributions may help to increase the efficacy of outreach efforts for early intervention and help seeking for parental concerns.

This study examined how Americans' endorsement of an implicit theory of personality influenced their beliefs about mental illness and mental health treatment preferences. Method : One hundred and twenty (120) American residents completed an online survey in which they completed a measure of their implicit theory of personality, read a vignette about a neutral target stimulus evidencing symptoms of mental illness, then completed measures of stigmatization of mental illness, causal beliefs about mental illness, mental health treatment preferences, prognosis beliefs about mental illness, and genetic determinism beliefs about mental illness. Results: Eighty-nine (89%) of participants could be categorized as either endorsing an entity or incremental theory of personality. Participants who endorsed an entity theory of personality were less optimistic about the prognosis of the target stimulus' mental illness and were more likely to endorse the belief that the target stimulus' mental illness was caused by heredity. Conclusions: Americans have fundamental beliefs regarding the fixedness or malleability of personality and can be relatively easily categorized as falling into one of two 'camps' regarding these beliefs. Implicit theories of personality influence beliefs about mental illness and mental health treatment in that the degree to which a person believes personality is fixed appears to carry over to the extent to which they believe mental illness is fixed. Implications for clinical work and psychoeducation about mental illness and mental health treatment are discussed.

The elimination of violence against women remains one of the serious challenges especially in India as the prevalence of rape has exceed to a point where even children of five years of age are being tortured and raped. Furthermore, in most of the cases victims are tremendously facing taunts and torture instead of getting proper justice. In this male dominating society it is very important to identify the basic attitudes of men towards rape and the pattern of attitudes of them may lead us to access to the causes as well as prevention of rape. This body of work highlights the importance of studying attitudes held by the general public as findings suggest that societal views can have a significant negative impact on the mental health of victims. The aim of the study is to assess the variation of attitude among different age groups towards rape, perceived causes of rape and rationalisation of rape of male persons of society. It is also aimed to understand social desirability level and personality dimensions of participants can effectively influence their attitude across different age groups. A sample of male persons (n = 200) consisting of 4 groups classified according to their age in 15-25 years, 26-35 years, 36-45 years and 46-55 years were selected for the study. The variables attitude towards rape, perceived causes of rape and rationalisation of rape were assessed using Attitude Towards Rape Scale, Perceived Causes of Rape Scale and Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale respectively. To assess social desirability and personality dimension Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability Scale and Neo Five Factor Inventory were used respectively. From the result findings it may be observed that people of different age groups vary significantly in their attitude towards rape and social desirability level and openness dimension of personality also influence some aspects of attitude towards rape across different age groups of male persons.

Participants (N = 314) completed an online self-report assessment of causal attributions for their own breast cancer, FCR, psychological well-being and optimism. Simultaneous multiple regression analyses were conducted to explore the overall contribution of causal attributions to FCR and psychological well-being separately. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were also utilised to examine the potential moderating influence of dispositional optimism on the relationship between causal attributions and FCR and psychological well-being. Causal attributions of environmental exposures, family history and stress were significantly associated with higher FCR. The attribution of stress was also significantly associated with lower psychological well-being. Optimism did not moderate the relationship between causal attributions and FCR or well-being. The observed relationships between causal attributions for breast cancer and FCR and psychological well-being suggest that the inclusion of causal attributions in screening for FCR is potentially important. Health professionals may need to provide greater psychological support to women who attribute their cancer to non-modifiable causes and consequently continue to experience distress.

As psychotherapy is grounded in a cultural context and must be congruent with the patient’s cultural beliefs of his or her illness in order to be effective, the consideration of cross-cultural differences in illness representations becomes increasingly important. Especially research on illness representations concerning mental disorders is scarce. Methods: The aim of the current study was to compare illness representations between Iranian (N = 87) and German (N = 90) patient samples as well as subclinical samples (Iranian N = 264, German N = 102) using a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Illness representations were measured using the Illness Perception Questionnaire Revised (IPQ-R). Initially, a factor analysis was conducted in order to ensure comparability of the IPQ-R between the Iranian and the German sample. Results: The factor analysis already revealed differences in item compositions of the IPQ-R subscales indicating differences of the conception of illness representations between the samples. Further, the Iranian samples showed a significantly higher amount of supernatural causal beliefs and emotional representation of the illness than the German samples. Surprisingly, the Iranian patient sample showed the highest amount of illness coherence. Conclusion: The current paper contributes to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural differences in illness representations regarding mental disorders. Nevertheless, further research is needed to confirm current findings and to further elaborate on the relationships found.

Causal Attributions in the Era of Biological Psychiatry. An online survey was programmed and hosted on the LimeSurvey Software Version 2.0+ (Germany). The link to the survey was sent to members of European academic communities representing different fields for further distribution. After providing informed consent, participants read a brief text describing the clinical picture of xenomelia. This text was accompanied by a scattergram depicting the correlation mentioned above alongside the display of an inflated right hemisphere showing the location of the cortical area involved. Participants were asked to rate, on the basis of the described finding, the plausibility of each of two statements by placing a slider on a line between 0 (maximally implausible) and 100 (maximally plausible). In total, 769 participants from a European country, who were at least 18 years old, answered the survey. Together, the findings confirm that, in making causal inferences about brain-behavior correlations, 'the vector of causality is unidirectional: from brain to mind', even in academia. The inference of causality regarding the symptoms in conditions such as xenomelia has wide-ranging societal implications. Access to and nature of care will heavily depend on the emerging definitions of such conditions. Fortunately, those whose training prepares them to work in the medical or neuroscientific sector seem slightly less inclined to put grey matter before social matters. There is thus hope that the social and cultural components of xenomelia as well as other conditions in a similar situation will not be underestimated.

Brugger et al. (see record [rid]2013-20861-001[/rid]). The paper by Brugger, Kurthen, Rashidi-Ranjbar and Leggenhager describes how individuals who are 'potential medical specialists' compare to those who are not in perceiving causal attributions in a rare condition, xenomelia. This work is timely given that since the first description in 1977, authors witnessed a raise in studies in 2009 and in 2014, but the general trend is of 3.8 papers per year. Compared to other rare conditions, such as Capgras syndrome or Alien Hand syndrome, the difference is striking. Between 1977 and 2018, 549 papers have been published on Capgras and 176 on Alien Hand. Hence, this paper is fundamental to understand this different attitude towards xenomelia, and what can be done to get out of the quicksand in which authors have ended up. Bruggeret al. paper should guide the development of future studies on xenomelia. We need to include biological, social and cultural components, but for the latter ones we need an operational definition of which components and why. This definition is still lacking, while neuroscientific studies benefit from a clear direction towards exploring more known body representation components.

Method: Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with 38 Australian secondary students (25 females, 13 males) aged 15–17 years. Adolescents were asked an open-ended question about the causes of depression, followed by a series of prompts about common causes of illness. A deductive thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes within the data set. Results: Participants emphasised potentially mutable psychosocial causes of depression (e.g., exposure to stressors, lifestyle) over biogenetic factors (e.g., genetics, chemical imbalance). Stigmatising explanations of depression were rare, although a minority gave explanations broadly consistent with a ‘weak not sick’ stigmatising attitude. Conclusion: The findings suggest that adolescents perceived depression causation to be complex and multifactorial. Understanding the causal beliefs that are most salient amongst adolescents can inform messaging in relation to efforts to prevent depression at this time.

Common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs) are frequently experienced in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), where low-educational attainment, poverty, and gender-based violence are widely recognized risk factors. The goal of this dissertation research was to examine local understandings of perinatal mental health to inform the development of a mental health intervention that will be integrated into community-based maternal health services in Selingue, Mali. To achieve this goal, we had three research aims: first, to qualitatively identify local terms and ethnomedical models for mental health among perinatal women in Mali, West Africa; second, to develop a holistic understanding of local syndrome(s) for mental health among perinatal women; and third, to identify a feasible and acceptable intervention model for the integration of mental health into community-based maternal services for perinatal women in Selingue, Mali. Methods. First, we conducted freelist interviews among perinatal women, auxiliary midwives, and community health workers (CHWs), to identify local terms for mental health. In-depth interviews were carried out among perinatal women, auxiliary midwives, CHWs, and mental health specialists to gain a nuanced understanding of priority mental health problems, perceived causes, and if and how women seek care or manage their distress. To gain a holistic understanding of local syndrome(s) for perinatal mental health, we conducted pile sorts, asking participants to sort 36 terms, identified from the free lists, into groups based on which terms go together. We then performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a perinatal depression scale, adapted for the Malian context. Lastly, we performed a scoping literature review on current best practices for closing the maternal mental health treatment gap and used data from in-depth interviews to develop recommendations for a locally informed approach for integrated mental and maternal health care. Results. Perinatal women used idioms of distress to communicate difficulties (geleya), pain, stress, and suffering (tooro), worries (hamin), and a crying heart or sadness (dusukasi). Participants indicated that these idioms of distress operate along a progressive continuum of severity of distress that increases with time, both between and within idioms. Using multidimensional scaling to analyze the pile sorts data, we identified a single large cluster, indicating that there is one single category of included terms for perinatal mental distress. The EFA results were in agreement with the pile sorts findings, yielding one single underlying construct for perinatal mental distress. Results from the scoping literature review indicate that integrated mental health intervention models that rely on task-sharing, are successful and strong approaches to address barriers towards closing the mental health treatment gap. Our qualitative findings suggest that it is both locally feasible and acceptable to integrate mental health services into existing community health care systems. Conclusions. Qualitative and quantitative examination of perinatal mental health in Selingue, Mali, contributed to both the holistic understanding and measurement of perinatal depression. In the context of poverty and lack of care and treatment options for mental illness, interventions that integrate mental health into community-based maternal health services emerge as locally acceptable and feasible strategies to narrow the mental health treatment gap in Selingue, Mali.

Stigma and cultural and religious values play a significant role in mental health care utilization disparities. The purpose of this study was to explore beliefs about mental illness among Latino faith-based communities. Methods: A qualitative approach was used to explore perceptions of mental illness that were elicited during 'El Buen Consejo,' a mental health literacy intervention delivered within three faith-based settings. Results: Participants were socialized to believe that persons with mental illness were dangerous, out of control, and suffering from an incurable illness that resulted in rejection and ostracism. Most families would deny the existence of depression and mental illness, unless symptoms greatly interfered with daily functioning or were life-threatening. Religious coping such as prayer, and faith in God, were believed to be protective factors. Causal attributions for depression were both biomedical and religious, such as lack of faith, not praying, demons, and sinful behaviors of parents. Conclusion: Latinos rely upon churches as a major social, educational, and spiritual resource. The cultural values among Latinos can be a source of strength but also contribute to stigma. The faith-based community is an important target for mental health literacy and antistigma interventions.

Our purpose was to explore perceptions of Indian parents regarding causation and diagnosis of problematic childhood behaviors diagnosed as ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder, and to understand the process of decision making and help seeking using a qualitative study design. Method: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 52 parents (33 mothers and 19 fathers), focusing on initial emotional reactions and cognitive appraisals, decision making, parental causal explanations and perceptions regarding diagnosis and symptom labeling. Results: Mothers were decision makers for seeking professional help either singly or jointly in 76.1% of cases. Initial reactions ranged from those with negative valence (negative emotional reactions and cognitive appraisals) to ambi-valence (recognition of problems, but at the same time not accepting completely) and positive valence (sense of relief and hopefulness). Psycho-social explanations (63.46%) were more common than biological explanations (51.82%), with 19.23% reporting both explanations. Biological explanations included illness model (e.g. brain problem, obstetric complications), hereditary and intellectual disability. Psycho-social explanations included psychological (e.g. lack of motivation) and social (e.g. problems with disciplining at home) causations. Irrespective of initial reactions and causal explanations, a significant majority of parents were aware of the diagnosis and labeled problems as symptoms attributable to ADHD. Conclusion: Our findings provide insights for development of culturally sensitive psycho-social interventions; from understanding of causal attributions, process of decision making and help seeking.

We examined supporters’ influence on recipients’ cognitive processing as a mechanism of effects of support on outcomes associated with depression.Design/methods: 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment. 147 participants (1) experienced a negative event (false feedback); (2) received social support modeling one of two contrasting cognitive processing modes (abstract/evaluative or concrete/experiential); (3) generated explanations for the event, later coded for processing mode and internal/external causal attribution; and (4) reported on emotion, perceptions of self and future, and social affiliation. To examine relational effects, half of participants were led to perceive the supporter as similar to themselves via a shared birthday manipulation.Results: Support condition influenced participants’ processing mode and causal attributions as predicted. Abstract/evaluative support led to more positive emotion and self-perceptions, and less pessimistic expectancies for the future than concrete/experiential support. Perceived similarity moderated effects on beliefs about an upcoming social interaction, magnifying positive affiliation outcomes of abstract/evaluative versus concrete/experiential support. Conclusions: Processing modes that are generally maladaptive at the intrapersonal level may be adaptive (and vice versa) when they are interpersonally influenced, and perceived similarity may facilitate interpersonal effects of processing mode on affiliation.

The objective of this study was to explore the perceptions of nightmare sufferers regarding the functions, causes, and consequences of their nightmares, as well as their strategies for coping with nightmares. Twenty university students with frequent nightmares took part in an individual semi-structured interview constructed by the research team. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Verbatim were analysed using a content analysis method. Four major findings emerge from this study. Firstly, the main perceived causes of nightmares, including one’s occupational and social life, support the hypothesis that dreams reflect waking concerns. Secondly, nightmares tend to decrease sleep quality and to provoke sleep fragmentation, which may be aggravated by sleep avoidance and voluntary awakening from lucid nightmares. In turn, the fatigue that results from a disturbed sleep can negatively affect concentration, daily functioning and mood. Thirdly, nightmares can impact emotions upon awakening and during the day, directly and indirectly, through various mechanisms. Fourthly, nightmares are frequently perceived as a source of personal insight: half of the participants believe that their dreams can reveal information about themselves, searching for the meaning of nightmares is one of the most common coping strategies, and many participants experienced a reflection or realization following a nightmare. A model is proposed to integrate the findings and explain how the nightmare problem might perpetuate itself.

Research has indicated that explanations that attribute mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, to biogenetic causes, as opposed to psychosocial causes, lead the public to direct less blame towards affected individuals, but to express greater pessimism regarding these individuals' prognosis. Given these mixed findings, variables that might mitigate negative effects or enhance the positive effects of various causal explanations for mental illness on stigma have become of interest. The present study investigated whether psychological inflexibility, which has been shown to be positively associated with mental illness stigma, moderates the relationship between causal explanations and multiple components of stigma. Participants included 558 adults, ages 18 or older, recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants answered questions about their personality and personal beliefs, read one of three different vignettes about a hypothetical character with schizophrenia, which attributed the character's condition to either biogenetic, psychosocial, or uncertain causes, and completed questions that assessed stigma towards the vignette character. It was hypothesized that, compared to those who were afforded a psychosocial explanation for the vignette character's condition, participants who were given a biogenetic explanation would ascribe less blame to the character but endorse greater prognostic pessimism. It was also hypothesized that more psychologically inflexible participants would be more stigmatizing of the vignette character than those who were less psychologically inflexible. Finally, it was hypothesized that psychological inflexibility would moderate the relationship between causal explanations and stigma. A one-way MANCOVA was conducted to test the study hypotheses and univariate tests of between-subject effects were conducted as follow up. Results indicated mixed support for study hypotheses; the different causal explanations did not impact stigma towards the vignette character and psychological inflexibility did not serve as a moderator, but psychological inflexibility did have an effect on multiple components of stigma. Implications of these findings for stigma reduction efforts and future research on the relationship between psychological inflexibility and stigma are discussed.

Numerous representative population-based studies have been conducted around the globe, also in European countries bordering on the Mediterranean Sea. However, relatively little is known about public beliefs in countries in Northern Africa.; Objective: To fill this gap by comparing public beliefs about mental disorders in Tunisia and Germany, focusing on causal beliefs, help-seeking recommendations and treatment preferences.; Methods: Representative national population-based surveys have been conducted in Tunisia in 2012 (N = 811) and in Germany in 2011 (N = 1852), using the same interview mode and the same fully structured interview starting with a vignette depicting a person suffering from either schizophrenia or depression.; Results: In Tunisia, the public was more likely to adopt psychosocial and to reject biogenetic explanations than in Germany. Correspondingly, psychological treatments were more frequently recommended and biological ones more frequently advised against. There was also a strong inclination to share religious beliefs and to recommend seeking religious advice. Tunisians tended much more than Germans to hold moralistic views and to blame the afflicted person for his or her illness. In Tunisia, the public tended less to differentiate between schizophrenia and depression than in Germany.; Conclusion: Marked differences between Tunisia and Germany exist in public beliefs about the causes of mental disorders and their treatment, which correspond to differences in cultural orientations prevailing in these countries.

Genetic attributions can increase the desire to remain distant from someone with a mental illness (desire for social distance), reduce one’s beliefs that an ill person can get better (prognostic pessimism), and cause people living with mental illness to be perceived as more dangerous. Presenting information about how mental illnesses can be treated alongside a genetic causal attribution may combat these negative side effects. Participants (N = 268) were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to read vignettes about a man ('John') with schizophrenia. Participants randomly received either a genetic or environmental attribution for John’s illness, and then received treatability information or no information. A genetic explanation of schizophrenia led people to believe that the symptoms of schizophrenia described in the vignette were more permanent, p < .01, ηp²= .07; however, this finding was qualified by a significant interaction where the type of attribution had no impact on prognostic pessimism when presented with treatability information, p = .04, ηp² = .01. The present findings suggest the potential importance of emphasizing treatability information for disorders that are perceived to be genetically influenced.

The present study primarily explored teachers' stigmatizing attitudes toward those with mental illness and examined the predictive potential of three main factors (i.e., level of previous contact with someone with mental illness, previous education about mental illness, and teachers' beliefs about the causes of mental illness). Using a cross-sectional, web-based survey design, 237 Saskatchewan teachers participated in the study. As expected, significant associations were found in two of the main factors: teachers' beliefs about the causes of mental illness (endogenous and interactional) and the amount of previous contact teachers had with those who were perceived to have mental illness. Higher levels of previous contact and more extreme biological causal beliefs were associated with more stigmatizing attitudes whereas higher levels of social and interactional causal beliefs were associated with less stigmatizing attitudes. In contrast to what was expected, the third main factor investigating the relationship of previous training about mental illness was not significantly associated with stigmatizing beliefs about mental illness in teachers. The amount of previous contact with those who have mental illness and both endogenous and interactional causal beliefs about mental illness were found to be significant predictors of stigmatizing attitudes. Results provide important considerations for teachers' professional development and school-based mental health efforts.

This online survey study presented three vignettes depicting clients with major depression (MDD), alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse to test licensed clinical psychologists' negative countertransferential reactions and perceived attributional biases to these disorders. It was hypothesized that participants would hold significantly more stigmatizing views of clients with SUDs compared to a client with MDD, and would be more likely to attribute MDD to a chemical imbalance and SUDs to poor willpower. One hundred and forty-one clinical psychologists licensed to practice in the state of California completed the survey.

This pilot study was conducted with a sample of female veterans who had a primary care provider (PCP) and experienced a sexual functioning concern during the previous 12 months, to explore: a) whether a relationship exists between depression and sexual functioning among a sample of female veterans receiving primary care b) if female veterans' dynamic with PCPs, when controlling for depression, is associated with sexual dysfunction and c) the reasons why female veterans do or do not talk to their PCP about sexual concerns. A total of 32 female veterans completed a web-based survey that assessed for depression (PHQ-9), sexual dysfunction (FSFI), and patient-provider alliance (KAS-R). Military sexual trauma (MST) experiences were common, with 72% of the women reporting sexual harassment in the service and 41% reporting sexual assault. Moreover, women who experienced MST had higher depression scores, poorer sexual functioning, and poorer alliance with their PCPs than women who did experience MST. A moderate relationship was found between depression and sexual functioning. Although 97% of the participants reported being at least a little bothered by their sexual functioning difficulties, only 12.5% had discussed their concerns with their PCP. Patient-provider alliance was not associated with poorer sexual functioning, when controlling for depression; however, depression did vary as a function of patient-provider alliance and sexual functioning. Participants reported their perceived cause of the problem, comfort level, perception of provider's ability, acceptance of the problem, and getting help for the problem as reasons for communicating or not communicating with their PCP about their sexual difficulties. Although the small sample size calls for replication before findings can be generalized, the implications for clinical care as well as the value for future research is clear.

Specifically, this study seeks to explore the attitudes and beliefs of teachers as it relates to the use of therapy dogs to de-escalate students exhibiting undesirable behaviors. Additionally, this study will seek to discover the benefits and/or challenges the use of therapy dogs bring to the classroom. The research resulted in three major themes emerging: (a) types of undesirable behaviors and perceived causes, (b) skills, strategies, and resources for managing undesirable behaviors, and (c) teachers' understanding of the use of therapy dogs in the educational setting. The study sample consists of nine teachers from an elementary school in South Carolina. This phenomenological study used the qualitative data collection strategies of a focus group and one on one interviews. Interviews were transcribed and data from the transcriptions were analyzed for this study using various coding methods. The voices of these educators shared their trials and frustrations as it relates to undesirable behaviors in the classroom as well as their hope for innovative strategies such as the use of therapy dogs that can aid in mitigating these behaviors. In addition to the information teachers shared regarding behavior and the use of therapy dogs, they also shared excitement about the use of therapy dogs to aid in the academic success of students.

Cognitive therapy (CT) is an evidence-based treatment that primarily helps patients with MDD modify their negative and dysfunctional thinking patterns in order to reduce their depressive symptoms. One important cognitive style in MDD is cognitive vulnerability, or the attributions that people make about the experience of negative life events. The reformulated learned helplessness theory posits that people with a tendency to make global, stable, and internal causal attributions for negative life events are more likely to become depressed (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978). The revised hopelessness theory suggests that, in addition to these three causal attributions, perceived consequences and inferred low self-worth are also key attributions that may lead to developing depression (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989). The present study investigates these two theories of cognitive vulnerability as predictors of acute symptom reductions, dropout, and relapse in CT for depression. Moreover, whether the revised hopelessness theory predicts acute and long-term treatment outcomes above and beyond the older reformulated learned helplessness theory is tested.In this study, 126 patients diagnosed with MDD participated in 16 weeks of CT and cognitive vulnerability was assessed pre- and post-treatment. First, cognitive vulnerability decreased during an acute course of CT and these reductions were associated with concurrent improvements in depressive symptoms. Second, greater pre-treatment cognitive vulnerability emerged as a prognostic indicator of faster depressive symptom reductions during CT. Third, cognitive vulnerability was not predictive of risk of treatment dropout. Finally, a composite measure of the three causal attributions outlined by the reformulated learned helplessness theory predicted relapse during a one-year follow-up period. When testing these two theories, adding the two attributions suggested by the revised hopelessness theory significantly improved the prediction of slopes of symptom change. However, adding these two dimensions did not improve the models predicting dropout or relapse. Overall, this study demonstrates how cognitive vulnerability predicts acute and long-term CT treatment outcomes. Importantly, obtaining a more sophisticated understanding of cognitive vulnerability may have direct implications on intervention and prevention efforts for patients with MDD, with the overall goal of improving cognitive-behavioral treatments and reducing the risk for relapse.

M. Bailey (see record [rid]2020-69802-008[/rid]). The idea that something is inherently pathologic about people with sexual minority identities has a long and persistent history. Such theories, including biological and psychoanalytic approaches, have posited that homosexuality and mental illnesses are closely linked (Byne, 2007; Drescher, 2015). Following post-World War II scientific development of stress theory and research on stigma and prejudice more generally, minority stress theory departed from this formulation in arguing that what makes sexual minority people ill are social arrangements (Hobfoll, 1998; Meyer, 2003). Most recently, Bailey (2020) proposed a 'rival' genetic model to explain sexual minority disparities in mental health outcomes. In Fig. 1, accompanying this commentary, the current authors depict Bailey’s proposed model. The fgure shows that a genetic factor is responsible for both same-sex sexual orientation and neuroticism. In turn, neuroticism is related to rejection sensitivity and adverse mental health outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety). Neuroticism, together with these adverse mental health outcomes, is associated with increased reports of exposure to stigma, prejudice, and discrimination. This neatly explains the observation that sexual minorities report excess minority stress and adverse outcomes. In this model, reports of exposure to stigma, prejudice, and discrimination are spurious artifacts of neuroticism rather than accurate reflections of the world. This model is very different than the minority stress model, which has served as a leading model in explaining sexual and gender minority health disparities (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Bailey (2020) restricted his comments to sexual minorities, so the current authors discuss only sexual minorities in this reply, but similar arguments can be made regarding gender minorities. In summary, the current authors have shown that studies using multiple measures and designs extend the evidence for minority stress beyond the associational self-reports of stigma exposure cited by Bailey (2020). They have also shown that the evidence for a genetic model, proposed by Bailey as a rival to the minority stress model, is overly simplistic in its causal attributions and that the research evidence for such a model is weak.

Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed. Social media responses were collected and organized by stakeholder group. Data underwent qualitative analysis.; Setting: Remote focus groups and online surveys.; Patients: ICU patient survivors, family members, and ICU teams.; Interventions: Not available.; Measurements and Main Results: Semi-structured questions and open-ended survey responses. We enrolled 40 patients/family members and 31 ICU team members. Focus groups and surveys revealed three primary themes orienting humanizing/dehumanizing ICU experiences: 1) communication, 2) outcomes, and 3) causes of dehumanization. Dehumanization occurred during ""communication"" exchanges when ICU team members talked ""over"" patients, made distressing remarks when patients were present, or failed to inform patients about ICU-related care. ""Outcomes"" of dehumanization were associated with patient loss of trust in the medical team, loss of motivation to participate in ICU recovery, feeling of distress, guilt, depression, and anxiety. Humanizing behaviors were associated with improved recovery, well-being, and trust. ""Perceived causes"" of dehumanizing behaviors were linked to patient, ICU team, and healthcare system factors.; Conclusions: Behaviors of ICU clinicians may cause patients and families to feel dehumanized when in the ICU. Negative behaviors are noticed by patients and families, possibly contributing to poor outcomes including mental health, recovery, and lack of trust in ICU teams. Supporting ICU clinicians may enable a more empathic environment and in turn more humanizing clinician-patient encounters.; Competing Interests: The authors have disclosed that they do not have any potential conflicts of interest.

Methods: A cross‐sectional online survey design was employed in a sample of 136 adults with overweight or obesity (n = 121 females, Mage = 37.58, SD = 9.85). Results: Psychologists and psychological services were viewed favourably by participants, with little evidence of role knowledge deficits or significant treatment barriers. Behavioural and social causal beliefs about obesity were indirectly associated with intentions to see a psychologist for weight management through positive associations with psychologists' perceived helpfulness in lifestyle intervention. Indirect effects were not observed for psychological and medical causal beliefs. Conclusion: Promotion of psychological services in obesity could highlight their utility in addressing behavioural and social factors. However, there is a need for more research into avoidance of all sources of professional support in this context.

A mixed method design with two consecutive phases, quantitative (online survey) and qualitative (vignette think-aloud task, semi-structured interview), allowed for an exploration of educators with high and low mental health literacy levels, using descriptive, inferential, and constant comparison analyses. It was found that educators possessed mixed levels of recognition accuracy, and that these were relatively higher than educators' help-seeking confidence across both phases. In particular, externalizing (i.e., ODD) and internalizing (i.e., OCD) disorders were more recognizable, over specific internalizing ones (i.e., social phobia, depression). High mental health literacy educators expressed higher knowledge of help-seeking strategies, employed tiered-based interventions, and demonstrated higher confidence and self-efficacy in comparison to low mental health literacy educators. Further, educators' sense of comfort in implementing these was positively associated with their mental health literacy scores. In turn, educators' personal experience with someone with mental health problems or disorders was found to be correlated with their comfort in implementing social-emotional learning programs. Educators showed that they had sympathetic attitudes towards children with mental health challenges, but they also recollected more incidents that were characterized by student aggression directed both towards students, and towards teachers, themselves. In terms of causal attributions, educators attributed internalizing challenges towards children; in contrast, they attributed externalizing challenges to families. Finally, educators also showed more cognitive and emotional responsiveness towards externalizing behaviours but were more concerned about internalizing challenges. Together, these findings are interpreted to mean that there is an implicit level of bias within educators' emotions and decision-making about children with mental health challenges. Implications from these findings include increasing support for educators' mental health literacy in terms of recognition of internalizing challenges, help-seeking knowledge, and providing opportunities for the exploration of emotions and reactions during interactions with children with mental health challenges, especially externalizing ones.

Making such inferences can be difficult because of complex reciprocal relationships between attributions of the causes of particular events, and beliefs about the capabilities and skills that influence our role in bringing them about. Abnormal causal attributions have long been studied in connection with psychiatric disorders, notably depression and paranoia; however, the mechanisms behind attributional inferences and the way they can go awry are not fully understood. We administered a novel, challenging, game of skill to a substantial population of healthy online participants, and collected trial-by-trial time series of both their beliefs about skill and attributions about the causes of the success and failure of real experienced outcomes. We found reciprocal relationships that provide empirical confirmation of the attribution-self representation cycle theory.
