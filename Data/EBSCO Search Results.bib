Abstract = {Administered a questionnaire to 53 male and 64 female outpatients at a mental health clinic. The correlation between perceived locus of causal attribution for psychological problems and 3 possible correlates derived from attribution theory (typicalness, duration, and severity of the psychological problem) was examined. Results indicate that problems perceived as caused by internal factors tended to be seen as more severe and as having lasted a longer period of time. Results with typicalness were inconclusive.

Abstract = {The article focuses on the effect of severity, consistency and typical information on clinicians' causal attributions. Attribution theory, which deals with the antecedents and consequences of judgments about the causes of behavior, has inspired a number of recent studies. Clinical inferences by mental health professionals as to the causal variables related to a client's problem generally are viewed as systematic, but little research has been done to determine the variables that affect the types of causal inferences that clinicians tend to make about a client's condition. A variety of informational factors may influence the causal attributions that are drawn to account for an individual's behavior, and data and theory have suggested a number of variables for nonclinical situations.},

Abstract = {40 college students and 40 psychiatric rehabilitees performed a manual dexterity task in which consistent success or failure was manipulated over 4 consecutive task trials. Contrasting predictions for the use of causal attributions (luck, task difficulty, effort, and ability) following Trial 1 and Trial 4 for the 2 populations were derived from R. Heider's (1958) balance theory and 'naive theory of action.' Consistent with naive theory, students who succeeded and rehabilitees who failed used stable attributions to account for these first trial outcomes, whereas students who failed and rehabilitees who succeeded used unstable attributions. Only college students who failed made significant changes in their attributional patterns from Trial 1 to Trial 4. Results are discussed regarding intervention with psychiatric rehabilitees and other groups with severe achievement difficulties.

Abstract = {Before social causation explanations of psychological disorder can be considered plausible, the process by which social factors may affect the development of disorder must be made explicit in terms of a given theory. The present paper formulates an attributional theory intended primarily to explain social status effects, although other applications are possible. The point of departure for this model is the socializing influence of socioeconomic status on causal attribution tendencies (i.e., fatalism) and the resulting variation in vulnerability to psychological disorder. Data from 2 panel studies (1,322 Ss) suggest that causal attribution styles could in fact play a central role in the mediation of social causation of disorder. Comparisons of 2 contrasting versions of the attributional model show that a simple, linear interpretation of the intervening effects of fatalism may be the most adequate.

Abstract = {An 8-item blame scale was constructed to tap the areas about which an S made causal attributions to explain misfortune. This scale, along with the Social Readjustment Rating Scale and other measures, was administered through household surveys to 2 samples of 537 and 185 community residents. Consistent with the predictions of the study, demographic groups with fewer social resources had higher blame scores, and residents reporting more stressful life events were more likely to blame. Blame attributions were positively correlated with maladjustment and were unrelated to a separate measure of positive well-being. Discontent with social life, followed by financial situation, family life, and life opportunity blame, were consistently related to reports of maladjustment. Self-blame, however, was only marginally associated with poor adjustment. (30 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated goal conflicts in 5 open, closed, mixed, and public education correctional institutions for juvenile delinquents and predelinquents. 322 staff members completed the Correctional Practices Questionnaire and indicated the actual percentage of daily work performed for administration, custody, and treatment. Attitudinal data on correctional goals and the perceived causes of crime indicated that the majority of Ss agreed with educational training and therapy aiming at legal conformity or personal maturity and autonomy. The majority of Ss also agreed that remorse and deterrence were correctional goals; 53% held the opinion that habitual offenders are born criminals; a rather restrictive attitude toward inmates was typical for the issue of the ideal degree of inmate participation in different areas. A significant reduction of custodial activities was advocated when Ss' actual time budget was compared with what they considered the ideal time budget. Results indicate that atonement, guilt, custody, and deterrence were connected with the appreciation of work conformity as a means of rehabilitation. Overall findings do not support the hypothesis of the functional necessity of goal conflicts. (41 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Used a cognitive schema to explain health and illness behaviors among 78 19–26 yr old Chinese university students in Hong Kong. Ss were asked to attribute causes and suggest solutions to 5 health/mental health problems: weakness/fatigue, tension/anxiety, sleep difficulty, hollow/emptiness, and headache. The patterns of endorsement on the causal and solution categories used for the 5 problems were compared using a new asymptotic chi-squared test. The response patterns were found to be significantly different across the 5 problems. Each problem was attributed to multiple causes, including psychological, social, situational, somatic, and existential factors. The intended solutions were often related to the nature of the causal attributions especially when the problems were mild. In lay help-seeking, Ss would attempt a variety of self-help measures. However, for professional consultation, the medical doctor would be the primary care professional the Ss would turn to for most of the problems except in the case of hollow/emptiness.

Abstract = {Presents an analytic review of the cross-cultural literature on families of the seriously mentally ill. It is argued that Western values, ideological theories, and correlative treatment approaches may adversely affect client progress. Differential attitudes toward families, causal attribution, dependency issues, and expectancy levels in individualized and traditional cultures are discussed. The advantages of supportive networks for both clients and families are seen as related to emergent roles of family advocacy organizations. Issues related to the International Pilot Studies of Schizophrenia, the expressed emotion studies conducted by the British Medical Research Council's Social Psychiatry Unit, treatment perspectives, and deinstitutionalization are examined. The review indicates that societies believing in an external locus of control for mental illness subscribe to a disease model, view the afflicted individual as sick rather than as an agent of his or her own disability, apply realistic expectancy levels to functioning and productivity of the patient, and show more benign family relationships and lower rates of hospitalization. Societies that stress mutual interdependence rather than independent functioning provide a more salutary climate for the severely disabled. Implications for the psychosocial approach to rehabilitation are discussed. (3 p ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In accordance with A. T. Beck's (1967) cognitive theory of depression, irrational thinking by depressives was assessed among 11 female undergraduates who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) criteria for depression and 11 nondepressed female undergraduates. Ss completed the Beck Depression Inventory and the Irrational Beliefs Test and were then asked to describe 3 bad events they had experienced during the last year. Depressed Ss endorsed self-deprecating statements and used illogical justification for causal beliefs to a greater degree than nondepressed Ss, supporting the hypothesis that depressives are irrational in their beliefs and in the ways beliefs are justified. Limitations on the generalizability of these results are discussed, such as the fact that only 1 S was in treatment. (16 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Factors include self-familial domain, externalized blame, and uncontrollable domain. Five variables predicted hope for future well-being.

Abstract = {A model of social interactional systems in which causal attributions act in a moderator role is applied to malfunctioning family systems. Adult beliefs about the causes of caregiving outcomes are predicted to moderate the potential challenge or stress produced by difficult children. Caregiver affective and behavioral reactions then influence the affective and behavioral responses of the child, maintaining a continuous-loop transactional system. Evidence is cited from research on parents at risk for abuse that supports this prediction. Low perceived control over caregiving outcomes sensitized caregivers to negative child behaviors. Causal beliefs moderated the expressive reactions of both mothers and strangers to children characterized as relatively difficult or easy.

Abstract = {Investigated the effects of diagnostic category accessibility on causal attributions for an interviewee's behavior made by 65 mental health students and 36 undergraduate psychology students. In order to activate a specific diagnostic category, mental health students completed a test in which half answered questions about victims of rape attacks and half answered questions about the diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder. All Ss then rated their attribution for a female interviewee's nonverbal behavior along 4 dimensions: internality, stability, globality, and controllability. Undergraduates in the rape victim condition tended to make more stable and global attributions than did mental health students. Also, Ss in the personality disorder condition rated the cause of the interviewee's behavior as significantly more controllable than did Ss in the rape victim condition.

Abstract = {Examined the impact of a child's psychological disturbance on adults' judgments of causation, blame, and punishment for action outcomes portrayed across F. Heider's (1958) levels, using 197 undergraduates. The effect of these levels on perceived control and the utility of perceived control in predicting judgments were also investigated. It was found that (a) the psychological status of the child affected responses for a subset of Heider's levels but did not alter the pattern of responses across levels and (b) responses were not affected by the existence of a psychological disorder but appeared to reflect inferences regarding the capacities influenced by the disorder. Perceived control increased across Heider's levels and was more useful than previously investigated subjective probabilities in accounting for variance in perceived cause, blame, and punishment. Suggestions regarding the assessment of capacities necessary for being held accountable for one's actions are outlined. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Developed a questionnaire to discern the status of psychology and related mental health fields in non-Western countries. The questionnaire solicited responses in the following areas: perceived causes of psychological distress and behavioral deviance in a particular country, specific methods and procedures used in psychological treatment, and types of problems for which psychological treatment is most often sought. Mental health and related professionals in Barbados, Korea, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, Sudan, and Zambia completed the questionnaire. There are 2 particularly important dynamics that may need to be considered in US counselors' interactions with clients from non-Western cultural backgrounds: kinship influences and religious-spiritual influences.

Human Ss: 1,088 male and female Chinese school-age children and adolescents (aged 11–19 yrs) (middle school and high school students in Changsha). Ss included 580 males and 508 females. The impacts of 52 life events on Ss were examined using the SCL-90. 20 life events on the SCL-90 were closely related to psychological distress; and they concerned academic study, personal or family relationships, love affairs, illnesses, and accidents. Results are discussed in terms of the incidence of obsessive–compulsive personality disorders, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and paranoid ideation in Ss. Implications of the study are discussed concerning the need for psychological counseling and social training. (English abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results of a 2 (ethnicity of S) × 2(severity of disorder) × 2(gender of person with disorder) × 2(gender of S) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that Japanese-American students were more likely than White American students to attribute mental illness to social causes, to resolve problems on their own, and to seek help from family members or friends or both. Possible barriers to use of services by this sample of Japanese Americans include both a preference for informal resources and the stigmatization of mental illness.

Depressed patients and nondepressed lay persons alike had relatively extensive beliefs about the causes of depression that were comparable to those held by clinical psychologists. However, depressed patients tended to endorse biological explanations of the causes of depression to a greater extent than clinical psychologists. In contrast, clinical psychologists assigned a more important causal role to unconscious processes and childhood vulnerability factors than did either depressed patients or nondepressed lay controls.

Abstract = {The Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue (EMIC) was adapted, standardized, and translated into an Indian language (Kannada) for a cultural study of depression. The Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) and Combined Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety (CHRSDA) were also translated and used. The clinical ethnographic database generated by the EMIC integrated quantitative and qualitative data with respect to patterns of distress, perceived causes, help seeking, and general illness beliefs among 80 psychiatric patients. Most Ss cited nerves as the cause of somatic complaints. Questions about madness, considered distinctly different from their own problems, elicited a pattern of responses resembling their own problems. Complementary use of the EMIC and instruments like SCID and CHRSDA provides a method for cross-cultural research that integrates personal experience and professional concepts of illness.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to consider gender differences in laypeople's beliefs about and explanations of cancer. Over 700 adults answered a questionnaire about their perceptions and explanations of the disease. The majority of respondents identified cancer as the most fearful disease. Women were more frightened of cancer than were men, whereas men were more frightened of heart disease than were women. The greatest fear of cancer was its perceived incurability and the associated suffering, whereas the greatest fear of heart disease was perceived susceptibility. Men were more likely than women to hold a more negative attitude toward cancer information. Factor analysis of the perceived causes of cancer identified four causal factors, which were labelled Stress, Environmental, Health-related, and Behavioural. Men were more likely to identify behavioural items as important whereas women were more likely to rate heredity as important. Fear of cancer was highly correlated with the health beliefs but not with the perceived causes of cancer. However, a regression analysis found that these health beliefs explained only a small proportion of the variance in cancer fear. The findings are discussed with reference to cancer education.},

West Indian culture (including belief systems, family patterns, childrearing practices, racial mixtures, and geography) influences the presentation of and perceived causes of symptoms in mentally ill persons who are natives of the Eastern Caribbean Islands. Parenthood and childbearing beliefs and practices are discussed in relationship to their influences on the psychosocial development of the West Indian family. Salient cultural norms, mores, folkways, and habits are presented in relationship to the impact on clients presenting psychopathology. Cultural diversity requires the effective clinician to approach clients with an attitude of cultural relativity. Concerted effort on the clinician's part may be required to overcome egocentric feelings and behavior that could interfere with culturally relevant and effective intervention.

Unreflected in reviews of acute consequences are those victims who present with delayed consequences and chronic illnesses such as pain disorders. Stress-related health effects are also discussed. Cognitive changes include the alteration of cognitive schema and the changes in the relationship of causal attributions to distress. Psychological symptoms are common and continue for many years after sexual assault; these symptoms include anxiety, depression, and lowered sexual functioning and satisfaction. The authors then focus on psychological models and constructs of the aftereffects of rape, such as the PTSD construct, and examine theoretical explanations for the creation of PTSD symptoms. Common themes and limitations of current models are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Suggests that causal attribution is a pivotal cognitive process in the personal and social construction of meaning of an individual's symptoms and suffering. Cultural variations in symptom attribution (SMA) affect the pathogenesis, course, clinical presentation, and outcome of psychiatric disorders. Styles of attribution for common somatic symptoms may influence patients' tendency to somatize or psychologize psychiatric disorders in primary care. At the same time, SMAs are used to negotiate the sociomoral implications of illness. Research in social psychology and medical anthropology emphasizes the roots of attributional processes in bodily and social processes that are highly context-dependent and that must be understood as part of the construction of a local world of meaning. SMAs then may be understood as forms of positioning with cognitive and social consequences relevant to psychiatric assessment and intervention.

Abstract = {In this examination of the potential effects of therapist orientation, attribution, and therapeutic outcome on client evaluation in the psychotherapeutic context, it was proposed that therapists tend to make causal attributions based on their therapeutic orientation (psychodynamic vs. cognitive-behavioral), perceptions of the key actors in the situation (client vs. others), and outcome of the situation (success vs. failure to achieve progress in therapy). In addition, client evaluations were thought to be related to therapists' attributions for cause. Experienced psychotherapists (N = 250) evaluated the mental health of a client presented in one of eight case studies, in which client outcome and locus of control for cause of outcome were varied. No differences in attributional style were found between psychodynamic and cognitive-behavior therapists. Therapists were more likely to take credit for successful therapeutic interventions than for situations in which a client has not made progress in therapy; under these conditions, therapists' evaluations of clients were related to their perceptions of client responsibility for outcome. The implications of these findings for psychotherapy and attribution theory were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined 117 Israel Defense Forces mental health officers' (aged 23–50 yrs) causal attributions for the combat stress reaction (CSR) and the factors influencing their attributions. Ss' therapeutic orientation was assessed using the AID questionnaire (D. M. McNair and M. Lorr, 1964). Each S read 1 out of 16 vignettes describing a CSR episode. Four details in the story were varied and each of these had 2 possible values, resulting in a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 design. The variables were consensus, distinctiveness, level of objective stress, and type of symptomatology. Results show that the Ss tended to attribute a CSR to situational or environmental causes like combat stress, low unit morale, and physical deprivation. Causal attributes were found to be influenced by the Ss' professional affiliation, their therapeutic orientation, and their knowledge of the casualty's prior functioning. A multi-causal approach to understanding CSR has been reflected. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Surveyed 1,000 married mothers in Accra, Ghana, concerning individual, social, and cultural factors that influence treatment-seeking behavior for psychiatric problems. Bivariate analysis was used to identify those factors significantly related to orientation toward help-seeking for mental disorders, and multivariate analysis was used to determine the importance of each and the effect of causal beliefs. Results show that perceived cause of mental disorders, area of residence, age, ethnicity, membership in voluntary associations, and prior contact with medical facilities or personnel are the most important determinants of the orientation toward help-seeking for mental disorders. Ss who believed that a mental disorder was caused by a witch or ancestors tended to favor native healers, while those who believed it could be due to natural causes favored Western medicine.

Abstract = {Investigated the associations between social change, personality, causal beliefs, and mental health treatment style and goal preferences of 339 Ghanaian teachers (aged 25–56 yrs). The index of social change (ISC) was conceptualized as the average percentile rank of a person's income, education, and acculturation. Results indicate that beliefs and treatment preferences were affected by the ISC. High ISC teachers endorsed significantly higher ratings on belief in an internal cause for depression and dependent personality disorder and indicated greater preference for participation in treatment than did lower ISC teachers. Lower ISC teachers indicated a greater preference for greater individual goals in treatment for depression and schizophrenia. High ISC teachers also reported greater perception of interpersonal control and emotional support with less dependency and less interpersonal sensitivity than did lower ISC teachers.

Abstract = {Evolutionary theory, capturing and then proliferating the idea of higher and lower life forms, primitive and civilized races, was strongly implicated in the political, economic and social policies of the British colonial practice, because it provided a perfect rationalization for the assertion that Whites were superior to Blacks, and would only remain so if the living habits of Whites were strictly policed in order to prevent backslide to savagery. As a site of colonialization, the Cape Colony therefore provides fertile ground for the discussion of psychiatric ideas about intersections between 'race' and 'insanity.' Causes of mental disorder as a discourse on besieged colonials and their confrontation with Black Otherness can be traced in the etiological categories used in Cape asylum statistical tables during the period 1891–1909, and also in attributions of causes commonly ascribed to White and Black patients. This article compares perceived causes of mental disorder in White and Black lunatics, drawing on the statistical tables of the Valkenberg and Fort Beaufort Asylums. Case-studies taken from Valkenberg records for the period 1891–1920 are used to illustrate ways in which scientific theory and colonial experience were textualized in asylum doctors' writing.

Ss seeking help for PMS reported a significantly higher level of depressed mood and anxiety than a family planning control sample of 88 women. Ratings of depressed mood and anxiety were unrelated to menstrual cycle stage at the time of questionnaire completion, suggesting that many Ss were experiencing generalized distress. Both psychological and hormonal causal attributions were acknowledged, and the women expressed preferences for both psychological and hormonal treatments from the clinic.

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to determine to what extent attitudinal variables and demographic characteristics of respondents predict reported willingness to help subgroups of homeless persons. Participants included 291 (64% female and 36% male) predominantly (88%) Caucasian adult college students with a mean age of 38 years. Participants completed a packet that included a demographic questionnaire, the Modified Attitudes Toward Homeless Persons Scale, the Just World Beliefs Scale, a rank ordering of the perceived causes of homelessness, and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (including items specific to homeless persons). Criterion variables were reported overall willingness to help homeless persons and subgroups of homeless persons who were presented as being displaced, as having mental illness problems, or as having substance abuse problems. Predictor variables included locus of responsibility beliefs, just world beliefs, perceived dangerousness of homeless persons, and demographic items. Mental illness and substance abuse were endorsed as the most common causes of homelessness. Participants reported a greater willingness to help displaced homeless persons (t = 8.21, p <1) and mentally ill homeless persons (t = 8.38, p <1) than homeless persons with substance abuse problems, however did not differ in their willingness to help the former subgroups (t =.17, p >). Of the 52% of the variance accounted for in reported overall willingness to help homeless persons, perceived dangerousness accounted for 36% and locus of responsibility accounted for approximately 15% of the variance. Just world beliefs did not add a significant predictive contribution. Separate regression analyses found that political orientation was the best single demographic predictor, accounting for 20% of the variance in overall willingness to help. There was a main effect for locus of responsibility (Rao's R = 35.89, p <1) and for perceived dangerousness (Rao' (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined individual differences in attributions for unemployment and sex differences in coping. 94 unemployed Australian youth (aged 15–20 yrs) reported more depression and loss of behavioral/emotional control than 87 of their employed counterparts. There was a significant sex effect on both of these scales, and no sex by employment status interaction. Interviews with the unemployed Ss provided the basis for assessing the importance of causal vs solution attributions for the mental health of young unemployed people. The proposition that causal attributions are independent of solution attributions found support. There were no gender differences in causal attributions and no differential relationship with indicators of distress. Attributions of responsibility for solutions were clearly related to depression and loss of behavioral/emotional control. No sex differences or differential relations with depression emerged on this dimension either. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Conceptions of mental illness and their perceived causes were investigated as they relate to help-seeking attitudes of Soviet Jewish immigrants. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the factors that may contribute to the reported underuse of professional mental-health services by this group of immigrants. Data were gathered in two stages. First, a questionnaire using a vignette format, a questionnaire on general conceptions of mental illness, and a demographic questionnaire were administered to 222 Soviet Jewish immigrants residing in Los Angeles, California and Houston, Texas, to assess participants' causal attributions, the perceived helpfulness of various types of assistance and assistance providers, and general conceptions of mental illness, and to elicit some demographic information. The second stage included 12 semi-structured interviews with Soviet immigrants to further explore the subjects of the study. The results indicated that Soviet Jewish immigrants attribute mental illness mainly to social causes related to the changes in life situation and to social and environmental pressures. Causal attributions of mental illness were the most significant predictors of corresponding types of mental-health attitudes of the participants in this study. Participants' choices of mental-health assistance for themselves were significantly different from their preferences for psychological types of assistance for others. Participants placed their primary reliance on self or family and friends where mental problems are concerned. The belief that mental health is maintained by the avoidance of morbid thoughts was related to the notion of the importance of self-help. There were no significant gender differences found in the participants' responses. Based on the results of this study, the main barriers to use of mental-health services for Soviet immigrants appear to be the use of alternative, non-professional resources as social supports and probab (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The current study investigated the effect of confirmation and disconfirmation of gender based expectations about psychopathology on perception of psychological health, and on the causes ascribed to psychopathological behaviors (causal attributions). Participants were 245 male and female college students, who had resided in the United States since age 12, and were unfamiliar with psychopathology. Based on a theoretical model proposed by Deaux (1976), the current study hypothesized that the causes ascribed to psychopathological behaviors would be affected by the confirmation and disconfirmation of gender based expectations about psychopathology. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that perception of psychological health would be affected by the causal attribution processes explicated in Deaux's model. The experimental manipulation was vignettes that described male, female, and sex unspecified actors with psychopathological behaviors that were male linked (associated with males), female linked (associated with females), and gender neutral (associated equally with males and females). Participants assumed the role of a counselor, and evaluated the psychological health of actors, using the Psychological Health Scale, an instrument derived from the Health Sickness Rating Scale (Luborsky 1962, 1975). Participants also rated the cause of the dysfunctional behaviors on locus of causality (dispositional-situational), and stability (stable-unstable) dimensions, using two subscales of the Causal Dimension Scale (Russell, 1982). For the hypotheses to be supported, an interaction between gender linkage of the psychopathological behaviors and sex of the actor would have to be obtained. However, statistical analyses did not reveal an interaction, therefore the hypotheses were not supported. It was concluded that, while the psychologically dysfunctional behaviors, used in the current study, contained both gender and psychopathological components, gender linkage was overwhelmed by the p (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Interviewed 106 people from the Asian communities in a British town to determine attitudes toward and use of mental health services. Ss were from Indian, Pakistani, and East African Asian backgrounds. Personal and social stresses of the group were explored, as were their perceptions of the causes of mental illness and appropriate responses. Although most people saw family and social stress as central, a religious dimension was also prominent, in terms both of causes and treatment of mental illness. There was no evidence of rejection of mainstream services. A lack of knowledge of service availability was apparent, with a heavy reliance on GP services for mental health care in the community.

A range of possible causes was elicited from clients, clinical staff and members of the public. These were arranged in a questionnaire form and administered to a sample of 113 psychiatric clients who were asked to express their beliefs regarding the causes of their own disorders. Factor analysis yielded 4 factors reflecting 'Psychosocial', 'Biological', 'Structural' and 'Stress' beliefs.

Eight of the Ss met DSM-IV criteria for major depression. All Ss completed paper-and-pencil instruments measuring depression, attributional style, arthritis-specific helplessness, disease severity and pain and disability. As predicted, attribution ×  perceived control interactions contributed significant variance to depression, after controlling for disease variables and arthritis helplessness. Specifically, internal and global attributions for negative events were associated with increased levels of depression under conditions of decreased perceived illness control. The findings provide support for examining general attributional style in studies of depression in RA and for cognitive diathesis-stress conceptualizations of adjustment to chronic illness. Clinical implications of the results for cognitive-behavioral treatment approaches in RA are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Attitudes toward deviant behavior that might indicate psychiatric disorder were investigated among the Inuit of Northern Quebec (Nunavik). 137 Inuit adults (aged 16–78 yrs) were randomly presented with 1 of 6 different vignettes that described a man with strange behavior who was either threatening or withdrawn, and whose problem was labeled either 'isumaluttuq' (burdened or weighed down by thoughts), 'demon possession', or 'mental illness'. Using a social distance scale, Ss rated their willingness to live, work, or hunt with this person and to allow him into their family. Significant predictors of greater social distance were female gender, more education, less familiarity with the behavior, and perception of the person as less likely to recover. Rating of likelihood of recovery was influenced by the vignette label, with isumaluttaq associated with less chance of recovery. Ascribing strange behavior to morally wrong action and to spirits or demons were highly intercorrelated and each was associated with perception of greater likelihood of recovery. Results suggest that Inuit attitudes toward deviant behavior are influenced more by perceived familiarity and likelihood of recovery than by labels, causal attributions, or explanations.

Abstract = {Examine whether trait conceptions and causal attributions contribute independently to maternal relationship satisfaction and whether these 2 social-cognitive variables mediate satisfaction with child behavior. 80 mothers (mean age 34.5 yrs) with at least 1 child 6–12 yrs of age reported their relationship satisfaction, causal attributions about events occurring to their child, state mood, and whether their child had been diagnosed with a mental disorder, and rated the child's traits. Results supported the hypothesis that trait conceptions and causal attributions contribute independently to relationship satisfaction. In support of the social-cognitive mediation hypothesis, the association between child disorder and relationship dissatisfaction was fully mediated by trait conceptions and partially mediated by attributions. Also, attributions moderated the association between trait conceptions and relationship satisfaction. Results support incorporating both trait conceptions and attributions into social-cognitive models of relationship satisfaction and have implications for interpersonal factors in psychopathology.

Abstract = {Sexually abused children frequently exhibit little or no psychiatric symptomatology when assessed during childhood, but it is important to examine what other consequences may result from the abuse, as sexual abuse is thought to be a major risk factor for a variety of adult mental health problems. It is possible that experiencing sexual abuse adversely effects important areas of children's functioning which contribute to the development of psychopathology later in life. The purpose of this study is to examine four areas of children's functioning, including coping, perceptions of helplessness, emotion regulation, and self-concept, in a group of twenty-two sexually abused, twenty-five psychiatric control, and twenty-seven normal control females between the ages of 6 and 12. Using teacher report (The Child Behavior Checklist: Teacher Rating Form), results replicated previous findings of parental reports which indicate that sexually abused children are perceived as experiencing more psychological difficulties than a normal population but fewer difficulties than those manifested by nonsexually abused child psychiatric outpatient populations. Furthermore, results from a projective measure, designed to indirectly assess trauma-related schemas, revealed that compared to a normal control group, sexually abused females have significantly more negative perceptions of themselves and others. Although sexually abused children also demonstrated more negative self concept on a self-report measure (the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale), these differences were not statistically significant. No significant differences between groups were found in regard to coping skills, as assessed by the Coping Scale for Children and Youth, or learned helplessness, as assessed by the Causal Attribution Measure. Significant differences were found in emotion regulation skills, as assessed by the Emotion Regulation Q-sort. However, results were against this study's predictions. The psychiatric control group demonstrated significantly more impaired emotion regulation skills when compared to the sexually abused children. The fact that sexually abused children demonstrate more negative perceptions of themselves and others has long-term implications for their development of appropriate interpersonal relationships, and their ability to utilize support networks during times of distress.

Abstract = {For the Tzeltal and Tzotzil speaking populations of Highland Chiapas, Mexico three specific conditions--jowiel 'aggressive madness', chawaj 'dizziness and disorientation', and tup' tup' ik' 'seizures'--are grouped together on the basis of behavioral criteria and symptom reports and defined as mental illness. This dissertation examines the experience and diagnosis of mental disorders for the Tzeltal Maya of Chiapas, Mexico. The methods employed include focused ethnoepidemiology survey, folk medical explanatory model survey, and recruitment of self-identified cases of recognized folk disorders--to provide a study population of cases for the administration of life history interviews, folk explanatory model questionnaire for the history of current condition, and video taping of interviews. The data reported on here reflect the self-diagnosed and reported health status of 1986 living individuals from 306 households in the Tzeltal Maya municipality of Tenejapa. Of those interviewed, approximately 100 individuals reported some illness, with 34 individuals reporting current or previous mental illness: 20 report chawaj, 5 report suffering from jowiel, 7 from tup' tup' ik', and 2 recount suffering from some other mental illness. The 'other' mental illnesses are headaches, sometimes classified as mental illness. Of the 33 individuals suffering from some type of mental illness, 21 females and 12 males comprise the population, or two-thirds women and one-third men. They range in age from an infant of 5 months old to a couple of elderly men of approximately 80 years old, males from 5 months to 82 years and women from 7 to 72 years of age. The indigenous taxomonic criteria for a differential diagnosis appears to be based on similarity of symptoms and distinguished through severity of expressed behavior over time. Of the three, tup' tup' ik' is the condition with the clearest biomedical concordance and the most treatable and avoidable Sufferers accounts of their experiences with these health conditions underscore the role of culture in the self-perceived cause and expression of illness.

Abstract = {Research on the mental health of ethnic minorities has increased notably in the past two decades in an attempt to develop more culturally sensitive and appropriate interventions. Within the depression research literature, one of the theoretical frameworks which has been proposed for conceptualizing the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of depression is the 'learned helplessness' model (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) and its reformulated 'hopelessness' model (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989; Alloy, Abramson, Metalsky, & Hartlage, 1988). The recent revisions of this model propose a diathesis-stress interaction in which individuals who engage in depressogenic causal attributions and make negative inferences about themselves and outcomes in response to stressful life events are predisposed to developing 'hopelessness depression' (Abramson et al., 1989). The present study examined how African-American and Anglo-American college students demonstrated differences in hopelessness responses to negative feedback in achievement-skills and social-skills related tasks. In addition, the extent to which group differences in hopelessness responding could be accounted for by personality and contextual variables that differed significantly between ethnic groups was assessed. Contrary to predictions, findings revealed that African-Americans demonstrated less hopelessness (i.e., less decrease in task self-efficacy) for the achievement-skills task than did Anglo-Americans. However, contextual and personality variables measured in this study did not account for the group differences. Possible explanations for these findings and implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {From both theoretical and practical perspectives, staff beliefs are likely to have a significant impact on the process of care for children and adults with mental retardation who engage in challenging behaviors. This paper reviews research addressing 3 domains of staff beliefs: definitions of challenging behavior, causal attributions, and beliefs about appropriate intervention. In general, staff definitions were found to be at odds with formal definitions. According to care staff challenging behaviors are actions that are difficult to manage. Staff causal attributions appear congruent with current theory, when measured with little specificity. However, when staff are asked to suggest causes of challenging behavior with clearly described functions they often fail to make appropriate attributions. Beliefs about appropriate short-term interventions suggest responses likely to develop and/or maintain challenging behavior, but beliefs about longer-term planned intervention appear to be more closely matched to contemporary practice. Reasons for this long-term/short-term distinction, based on the demands of the immediate situation, are proposed. Suggestions for future research on staff beliefs are discussed in detail.

Abstract = {A large number of disorders, seen as psychiatric from the perspective of US or other professional medicine, are to be found in countries around the world. Any and all of these may appear in the context of immigration. This chapter has (1) shown how Western psychiatry would perceive causes of mental disorders in immigrant populations and (2) presented some locally constructed mental disorders and how these might be (mis)interpreted by professional Western, largely US, psychiatrists.  Topics discussed include: introduction: immigrants and ethnopsychiatry (the immigrant experience, immigration and ethnopsychiatry, problem recognition, questions of Western psychiatric nosological universality, from perspective to illness); the problem of diagnosis in the West; sources disorders: views from the West (stress and complexity, psychological disorder and stigmatization, acculturation, physical deprivation and trauma, problems of communication); and non-Western constructions of illness.

Abstract = {This article describes a conceptual and data-analytic model for characterizing different levels of common and specific features of child psychopathology: common features, which differentiate psychopathology from normality; broadband-specific features, which differentiate internalizing problems (e.g., anxiety, somatization) from externalizing problems (e.g., aggression, hyperactivity); and narrowband-specific features, which differentiate different narrowband syndromes (e.g., anxiety from somatization, hyperactivity from aggression) within each of the broadband syndromes. As an illustration of the model, data for 6 cognitive variables (e.g., global self-worth, causal attributions) are related to 6 psychopathology domains (e.g., aggression, depression) in a sample of 204 children. It is suggested that common features may be related to severity of psychopathology, whereas specific features may be more related to differentiation of psychopathology.

Twenty-six parents were surveyed each week for six weeks using the Parent Attribution Scale-Revised. This scale measures parents' attributions of the causes for their children's behavior when taking MPH to treat symptoms of ADHD. When attributing causes for best behavior, the parents rated their children's effort most often followed by their own effort and the positive medication effects. When attributing causes for worst behavior, the parents rated their children's lack of effort most often followed by inadequate medication effects and their own lack of effort. Our study suggests that parents rate effort most often when making attributions for their children's best and worst behavior.

Abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a mental illness marked by episodes of mania or hypomania and episodes of depression. Its cyclical patterns make it likely to impact and be impacted by marital relationships. The course of this illness may be affected by cognitive factors (i.e., the causal attributions made by patients and their spouses to explain events) and family factors (i.e., spouse expressed emotion/criticality). The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship that causal attributions have with marital distress, spouse critical comments, and symptom outcome in patients with bipolar disorder. Participants were recruited from the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and included 39 couples with one individual with bipolar disorder. They completed interviews, videotaped interactions, and self-report questionnaires measuring spouse criticality, symptomology, attributions, and marital distress. Results indicated that more distressed patients with bipolar disorder made more internal attributions to their spouses for negative events. Additionally, more critical spouses made more internal attributions to the patients for negative events and less internal attributions to themselves for negative events. Finally, although patient attribution variables did not predict symptom outcome, it was found that the more internal to patient, external to self, and stable the attributions for negative events made by the spouses, the more symptoms displayed by the patients at the end of 10 months of treatment. Implications of the current research are that spousal attributions were related to patient symptom outcome and should be addressed in cognitively based marital therapy. Additional research examining the extent to which attributions can be effectively modified as a result of psychotherapy, and exactly what impact that may have on the course of illness, is required. Other directions for future research as well as limitations of the current study are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) is commonly used in the psychological assessment of parents within child custody evaluations. Due to the interface of mental health practitioners with non-mental-health professionals in the context of child custody cases, careful attention must be paid to the potential misunderstanding or misuse of data from psychological testing. While traditional clinical lore has maintained an expectation of clinically significant defensiveness on the MMPI-2 with this population, the research data does not support this view. Despite empirical findings that identify patterns of elevations on the MMPI-2 validity scales with parents involved in child custody disputes, these patterns have been demonstrated to reach statistical but not clinical significance. That is, MMPI-2 profiles that contain elevations on scales L or K that either invalidate or notably suppress clinical scales are not to be expected in the child custody population. False causal attributions contributing to the potential mischaracterization or loss of important data related to personality functioning within this population are identified and discussed. Potential dangers associated with such false causal attributions are reviewed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We investigated the relation between the label of 'schizophrenia' and causal attributions of violence. Undergraduates read 1 of 10 scenarios in which two variables were manipulated: a psychiatric label and environmental stress. The scenario described an employee who acted violently toward his boss. Subjects made causal attributions for the employee's behavior by completing an adapted version of the Causal Dimension Scale II. Subjects also completed a questionnaire designed to explore several issues concerning the effects of the schizophrenia label on perceptions of behavior. Contrary to the primary hypothesis, the schizophrenia label did not lead subjects to make significantly more personality causal attributions for violent behavior. With increasing environmental stress, subjects did make significantly fewer personality attributions. A follow-up study using practicing clinicians as subjects yielded similar findings. The results of these studies are discussed in light of perceived stereotypes of persons with schizophrenia and conceptual issues in attribution research.

Abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine whether or not post-treatment adolescent cancer survivors (ACS) make causal attributions when confronted by a cancer diagnosis, the nature of those attributions, and whether or not those attributions are associated with psychological adjustment. The causal attributions of thirty-four ACS (23 males, 11 females), ranging in age from 12-20 years (M = 16.3, SD = 2.3) were elicited by semi-structured interview and rated for causal source (internal vs. external) and causal controllability (controllable vs. uncontrollable) using an adaptation of the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations method (Schulman, Castellon, & Seligman, 1988). Psychological adjustment was measured by the Mental Health Inventory (MHI). Social desirability was evaluated by the Crowne and Marlowe Social Desirability Scale. One-way ANOVAS were used to evaluate the relationship between causal variables and MHI scores. Multiple regression models were used to evaluate sociodemographic characteristics and illness-related factors for potential effects. The findings confirm that ACS, like adults, begin an attributional search when faced with a diagnosis of cancer. Ninety-one percent of participants reported asking themselves 'Why me?' and 90% specified personal theories. ACS gave a broad range of reasons why they got cancer, most commonly citing environmental exposures and heredity. The majority of adolescents attributed their cancers to external and uncontrollable causes. There were no statistically significant differences based on the causal source or causal controllability variables. The participants were psychologically well-adjusted, with MHI scores comparable to the normative sample. Age, in the context of other sociodemographics, had a significant effect on the relationship between causal attributions and psychological adjustment Older adolescents were relatively more distressed than younger adolescents. Illness-related factors were not significant predictors for this group of ACS. Social desirability response set did not affect MHI variables. The findings support Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale's (1978) reformulation of the learned helplessness model that external causes are associated with better psychological outcomes for illness events. If the association between external/uncontrollable attributions and adjustment is borne out by future research, then clinicians could profitably focus on reframing adolescents' attributions, when necessary, to causes which are perceived as outside of oneself and beyond one's control.

Abstract = {This dissertation study examined the causal attributions made by 30 adult children for their severely mentally ill parent's symptomatic behaviors. A retrospective methodology was used in order to explore the development of attributions from their first realization that their parent was behaving in a problematic manner to the present time. This study also explored the associations between attributions and participants' levels of coping and resiliency, as defined by their present functioning. The results of this study lend support to the use of an attributional framework in the study of children of the mentally ill. The data gathered using the Adult Children of the Mentally Ill-Attribution Scale (ACMI-AS) indicated reasonable internal consistency and expected intercorrelations of the attribution stems. A factor analysis of participants' responses to the ACMI-AS revealed three factors, including Internal to Self, Internal to Parent and Predictability. The data suggested that participants' attributions significantly changed from their initial realization of parental symptomatic behavior to the present time. The analysis indicated that maturity was not wholly responsible for the change in attributions. Rather, the subjective amount of information concerning mental illness as well as extra-familial support were significant contributing factors. The analyses between attributions and coping as well as between attributions and resiliency suggested a relationship between these variables. The data further suggested that attributions for parental control of the symptomatic behavior or personal control by the child were associated with increased psychopathology and lower self-esteem and self-efficacy in respondents. Attributions that highlighted predictability, external causation, and biological causation were associated with fewer somatic complaints and increased social self-efficacy.

Abstract = {A survey of 70 insightful clinically stable out-patients with functional psychotic disorders and 70 accompanying relatives was carried out. They were interviewed about their beliefs concerning the cause of the illness, and their awareness of other possible aetiological factors. Relevant sociodemographic and clinical information were also elicited. Twelve (17.1%) patients and relatives, respectively, gave "medical" causal explanations; 16 (22.9%) patients and 13 (18.6%) relatives gave "psychosocial" causal explanations; 27 (38.6%) patients and 38 (54.3%) relatives were "uncertain" about the cause of their/relatives' illness (X2 = 5.08; df = 3: P = 0.16). Relatives reported a greater relevance of "heredity" (X2 = 11.58; P = 0.0006) and "supernatural" factors (X2 = 4.72: P = 0.029) as other possible causal factors, than patients. Patients with previous psychiatric hospitalisation reported higher prevalence of "psychosocial" and "supernatural" causal beliefs than those without (X2 = 9.15; P = 0.027). Also, patients with "medical" causal belief reported better treatment compliance than those with other beliefs (P = 0.031). Among relatives, "psychosocial" causal belief in comparison with other beliefs was associated with a longer duration of treatment in the hospital (h = 8.29; P = 0.04). For patients, knowledge about possible causal role of "heredity was significantly more prevalent among male than female patients (X2 = 6.55; P = 0.01) and admission of possible "supernatural" causation was associated with education below the secondary level (X2 = 6.68; P = 0.008). For relatives, knowledge about possible causal role of brain dysfunction was associated with longer duration of treatment (u = 3.93; P = 0.047), and knowledge of possible causal role of "psychosocial" stress was associated with urban place of residence rather than rural (X2 = 10.52; P = 0.0012). For both patients and relatives, the most acceptable aetiological proposition was the "supernatural" while the least was "psychosocial". Findings revealed, among others, the widespread belief in "supernatural" causation of mental illness in patients/relatives. Some identified significant findings may be relevant in mental health education programme development.},

Abstract = {This study had the goal of firstly exploring the interrelation of neuroticism and religiosity in clinically diagnosed patients compared with a group of healthy controls, and secondly, exploring differential aspects of positive or negative perceptions of religion in the individual. Measurements of religiosity and neuroticism were conducted in 44 patients (aged 18–65 yrs) with affective, anxiety and personality disorders, and 45 healthy controls. In addition, a battery of questions regarding the interaction of religion and mental health was applied. There was no correlation between neuroticism and religiosity, neither in the patient nor in the control group. However, marked differences were found in causal attributions and religious experience between patients and healthy controls. Anxiety concerning sexuality, super-ego conflicts and childhood fears of God was primarily associated with neuroticism and not with religious commitment. Healthy Ss consented significantly more often to the statement that 'religion can make a person sick' than patients with affective and anxiety disorders, who experienced religion rather as support than as a burden. However, they perceived their illness-related problems as an obstacle to express their faith. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Since the end of the WWII the western and eastern parts of Germany have been exposed to very different social and cultural influences. It was the authors' assumption that this should also be reflected in the beliefs about mental disorders held by the general public. In the autumn of 1990, immediately after German reunification, a representative survey on lay concepts of schizophrenia and depression was carried out in both parts of Germany. In all, 2,118 personal, fully structured interviews resulted in the West, 980 in the East. Results show that in general, there were more similarities than differences between West and East, particularly regarding causal attributions (with psychosocial stress being most frequently seen as etiologically relevant) and treatment recommendations (with psychotherapy clearly favored over drug treatment). However, there were also some differences, most notably a stronger tendency in the West to define depressive behavior in psychiatric terms and to recommend established forms of psychiatric treatment for its management. The authors' assumption that the exposure to different cultural influences should have led to discrepant beliefs about mental disorders was only partly confirmed.

Abstract = {People often engage in counterfactual thinking, that is, imagining alternative to the real world and mentally playing out the consequences. Yet the counterfactuals people tend to imagine are a small subset of those that could possibly be imagined. There is some debate as to the relation between counterfactual thinking and causal beliefs. Some researchers argue that counterfactual thinking is the key to causal judgments; current research suggests, however, that the relation is rather complex. When people think about counterfactuals, they focus on ways to prevent bad or uncommon outcomes; when people think about causes, they focus on things that covary, with outcomes. Counterfactual thinking may affect causality judgments by changing beliefs about the probabilities of possible alternatives to what actually happened, thereby changing beliefs as to whether a cause and effect actually covary. The way in which counterfactual thinking affects causal attributions may have practical consequences for mental health and the legal system.

Abstract = {Examined attitudes towards and etiology beliefs about mental illness. Ss were 126 1st-yr psychology undergraduate students (aged 17–45 yrs) in Auckland, New Zealand, who completed questionnaires before and after a series of 4 lectures concerning mental health problems given by 2 experienced clinical psychologists. Test materials administered included 8 items from the Mental Health Locus of Origin (MHLO); Results were evaluated according to Predictable–Unpredictable, Cold-hearted–Caring, and Endogenous–Interactional axes. Comparison of test scores showed that women's overall scores improved significantly; men's scores improved as well, but not significantly. Biological beliefs about the causes of mental health problems were related to negative attitudes, thereby confounding a common destigmatization policy linking mental health problems with medical illnesses. The amount of contact with those receiving psychiatric treatment was a strong predictor of positive attitudes, even stronger than acceptance of a psychological perspective. It is concluded that attitude changes are possible, at least in the short term. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The authors used nation wide survey data to characterize current public conceptions related to recognition of mental illness and perceived causes, dangerousness, and desired social distance. Data were derived from a vignette experiment included in the 1996 General Social Survey. 1,444 adult respondents were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 vignette conditions. Four vignettes described psychiatric disorders meeting diagnostic criteria, and the fifth depicted a 'troubled person' with subclinical problems and worries. Results indicate that the majority of the public identifies schizophrenia (88%) and major depression (69%) as mental illnesses and that most report multicausal explanations combining stressful circumstances with biologic and genetic factors. Results also show, however, that smaller proportions associate alcohol (49%) or drug (44%) abuse with mental illness and that symptoms of mental illness remain strongly connected with public fears about potential violence and with a desire for limited social interaction. Results suggest that while there is reason for optimism in the public's recognition of mental illness and causal attributions, a strong stereotype of dangerousness and desire for social distance persist.

Abstract = {Explored causal beliefs about, perceived importance of various treatments for, and attitudes towards, 6 mental illnesses (schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorder, alcoholism, and mental retardation) and 3 physical illnesses (tuberculosis, leprosy, and poliomyelitic paralysis) in 450 17–70 yr olds from northwestern Ethiopia. Principal components analysis identified 4 meaningful illness causal belief dimensions: Psychosocial Stressors, Supernatural Retribution, Biomedical Defects, and Socio-Environmental Deprivation. Psychosocial Stressors and Supernatural Retribution were rated more important causes of mental than physical illnesses. Prayer and home/family care were suggested more strongly for treating mental than physical illnesses. Systematic associations were found between causal beliefs, treatment beliefs, and attitudes towards patients. Ss' educational level was negatively related with traditional beliefs and positively related with favorable attitudes towards patients. Results indicate that causal beliefs, perceived importance of treatments, and attitude towards patients among northwestern Ethiopians are meaningfully interrelated. Implications for health services and research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Torture is practiced worldwide to further the ideologies of governments and political groups. Increasingly, survivors are fleeing their countries to seek asylum in the West. Research on torture survivors has recently become an emerging field in mental health and psychologists are increasingly likely to encounter and treat survivors of torture.  The purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which ethnocultural identification and causal attributions account for quality of life in adult survivors of torture. The researcher applied attribution theory as a conceptual foundation to better understand how survivors find meaning for the good and bad events in their lives. The research also aimed to better understand the characteristics of torture survivors and to make recommendations to improve the quality of mental health care. The research questions asked the extent to which ethnocultural identification and causal attributions accounted for quality of life in survivors of torture and to what extent the causal dimensions of locus of causality, stability and controllability accounted for quality of life when controlling for the effects of ethnocultural identification. Additional supplementary analyses were included to investigate the relations among selected demographic and major variables.  The sample was highly diverse demographically and included 45 participants in treatment at the Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture in New York City. Results revealed that ethnocultural identification and causal attributions did not explain a significant portion of the variance in quality of life. Likewise, the causal dimensions did not account for a significant portion of the variance in quality of life. Supplementary analysis revealed the following significant findings: participants in treatment for longer periods were more likely to report a better quality of life, those with higher levels of education were more likely to report a better quality of life and a greater sense of overall control in their lives, and more educated survivors were in treatment for longer periods of time. Finally, Asian participants expressed a stronger identification and attachment with their ethnocultural group than either White or Black participants. Implications for research, theory, and treatment for psychologists working with this population an discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{2002-15169-00420000401,
Abstract = {An increasing number of studies question the distinctiveness of depression and anxiety and show, firstly, that depression and anxiety are highly correlated and, secondly, that many of the cognitive mechanisms that characterize them are very similar. Thus, although there are numerous studies concerning depression and anxiety separately, there is relative confusion regarding the cognitive variables which differentiate each of them. It is becoming increasingly clear that the study of cognitive specificity of depression and anxiety requires a comparative methodological approach that differentiates these states in the same study. In this paper the conclusions of a relatively limited number of studies adopting such an approach are presented. These studies generally focus on 'thought content', 'locus of control', 'causal attributions' and 'information processing'. Then, implications of these findings as well as certain methodological issues and weak points are discussed and, finally, ways are proposed in order to deal with them. More specifically, the discussion focuses mostly on the general distress (psychopathology) factor, the methods of assessment, the chronobiology of depression and anxiety, the control groups and the comparisons of multiple groups and their combinations.

Abstract = {Investigated the nature and degree of stigma experienced by primary caregivers of schizophrenic patients in southern India, and associations between stigma, social variables, and perceived causes of illness. Ss were 159 primary caregivers (mean age 50.3 yrs) of schizophrenia outpatients— predominantly patients' parents. Caregivers rated 14 items concerning stigma, including difficulties with neighbors, marriage, shame, and guilt. Results show that a third of caregivers had no explanation for the illness and these respondents reported higher levels of stigma than those who attributed a definite factor. Stigma was higher if the patient was female, if patients and caregivers were younger in age, and if causes of the illness were attributed to character or lifestyle, substance abuse, problems in interpersonal relationships, or faulty biological functioning. Marriage, fear of rejection by a neighbor, and the need to hide the illness from others were the most stigmatizing aspects reported by caregivers.

Abstract = {Examines research on attitudes toward people with mental illness and sociological research on attitudes toward the role of 5 factors that influence the public's willingness to interact with people with mental health problems, including: the nature of the behavior described, causal attributions of the behavior's source, perceived dangerousness of the person, the label of 'mental illness,' and the sociodemographic characteristics of Ss. Using vignette data from the 1996 General Social Survey, the authors find that 1,444 Ss discriminate among different types of mental health problems by expressing more desire to avoid those with drug and alcohol problems than with those with mental illness. Results show that Americans who attribute mental health problems to structural causes are more willing to interact with the vignette person than those who see individual causes as the root of the problem. However, even controlling for these factors, Ss who label the vignette a 'mental illness' also express a preference for greater social distance. Finally, the degree of dangerousness that the public ascribes to people with mental health problems is important and appears to mediate the influence of effects of labeling a person as mentally ill.

Abstract = {Although individual therapeutic goals are considered to be important factors motivating patients to engage in therapeutic work, they have gained little attention in empirical research. In the present study, patients were given a questionnaire containing 24 therapeutic goals which could be rated according to their subjective relevance on a 5-point scale. N = 152 patients (mean age 34.5 years, 59.2% female) who presented at a university psychotherapy outpatient department to attend a diagnostic interview participated in the study. "To solve my problems" and "to get relief from my complaints" were the goals that were rated as most important. Goals pertaining to mental health such as more contentness and calmness, self-assertion and insight scored high, too. Three rational scales were constructed: 1. insight, 2. sociability, and 3. self-assertion. These scales were correlated with both patients' causal attributions and therapy expectations in plausible ways. However, the general strength of intercorrelations point of the conception patients goals were not very succinct at the time of the intake interview. Indication groups regarding specific therapeutic measures did not differ with respect to therapy goals. Only the general decision whether to recommend a psychotherapeutic intervention or not seemed to be influenced by patients' therapeutic aims.},

Abstract = {Describes the development of the Causal Models Questionnaire for Schizophrenia (CMQS) in China and reports preliminary results of administering this instrument to family members of persons admitted to hospital with schizophrenia. The CMQS, which includes 45 causes identified during indepth interviews with family members, was administered to 245 family members of 135 patients (aged 16–42 yrs) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) schizophrenia in Suzhou and Siping, China at the time of admission to hospital. Respondents, who identified a mean of 2.5 causes (range 1–10, mode 2), attributed 84% of the cause of schizophrenia to social, interpersonal and psychological problems. Hence, their beliefs do not concur with Chinese professionals' ideas about the biomedical causes of schizophrenia. Multivariate analyses identified the socio-economic factors that influence family members' causal beliefs. It is concluded that despite the complexity of causal models, measures can be developed that will help improve clinicians' communication with patients and understanding of help-seeking behaviors.

Abstract = {Religious interpretations of causality can be understood in the framework of cultural sensitivity, which is underlined in new formulations of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV). In an empirical study of 343 predominantly Protestant patients, who described themselves as religious, demonic explanations were found in 37.6%. 30.3% sought help through ritual 'prayers of deliverance' (with more or less exorcistic content). Functions of demonic attributions as well as the various forms of deliverance rituals are described. Often patients do not hold rigid convictions of the spiritual causes of their illness. Rather they are developing very subjective interpretations which exist side by side with other medically oriented explanatory models. Although many patients reported beneficial effects as a result of deliverance rituals, psychiatric examination could not observe extraordinary or lasting changes in the symptomatology. Discrepancies in the causal attributions can lead to tensions between therapist and patient. Assessment of religious attributions and their functions should lead to a 'shared construction of meaning' resulting in better support and coping.

The authors report data from a preliminary survey done in 5 capital cities of the European Union, EU (Madrid, Copenhagen, Brussels, Lisbon, and Rome). The main aim of this survey was to investigate, from a mostly qualitative point of view, the causal and supportive factors implicated in the situation of the homeless mentally ill in Europe. The results point out the familial and childhood roots of homelessness, the perceived causes of the situation, the relationships with the support services, and the expectations of future of the homeless mentally ill. The analysis of results has helped to identify the different variables implicated in the social rupture process that influences homelessness in major European cities. The results were used as the basis for the design of a more ambitious current research project about the impact of the medical and psychosocial interventions in the homeless. This project is being developed in 10 capital cities of the EU, with a focus on the program and outcome evaluation of the health and psychosocial services for the disadvantaged.

Abstract = {Investigated staff–patient relationships (SPRs) on a continuing care, inpatient facility for patients (PAs; mean age 32.7 yrs) with severe mental illness. 20 staff members (SMs; mean age 31 yrs) were assessed for expressed emotion (EE) in regard to a client. Their spontaneous attributions for the PA's problems were also assessed, along with self-report SM and PA ratings of their expressed and perceived feelings and thoughts about their SM or PA counterpart. Although none of the SM were rated as fulfilling criteria for high EE, there was evidence of some variability in the quality of SPRs as assessed. PAs seemed to be sensitive to SM feelings for them: PA ratings of perceived feelings and thoughts from SMs were significantly correlated with SMs expressed feelings both from the CFI EE ratings and the direct self-report SM measures. SMs tended to view the behaviors of PAs they felt less positively disposed toward as more controllable, and this association between less benign explanations of behavior and a more critical attitude is consistent with the attribution research for familial caregivers.

Abstract = {Dentists' perceptions about the stressfulness of dental practice, their perceptions about dental anxiety and its management were surveyed in a descriptive study. A mailed questionnaire was completed by 216 randomly selected Danish private dentists. Of these, nearly 60% perceived dentistry as more stressful than other professions. Dentist perceptions of the most intense stressors were (ranked): 1) running behind schedule, 2) causing pain, 3) heavy work load, 4) late patients and 5) anxious patients. Bivariate odds ratio (OR) analyses were undertaken to check for associations of perceived stress and other dentist variables with perceptual outcomes about anxious patients. Signs of dental anxiety were reported to be less often spotted by older (> or = 52 yr) dentists (OR=3.1) who perceived their job stress to be greater than that of other professionals (OR=3.2). Perceived causes of dental anxiety (1st, 2nd or 3rd choices tallied and then ranked) were 1) fear of pain, 2) trauma in dental treatment, 3) general psychological problems, 4) shame about dental status and 5) economic excuses. Dentists who reported that dental anxiety was primarily the result of general psychological problems in patients, usually had solo (OR=2.4) practices older than 18 years (OR=2.6) and reported high perceived stress (OR=2.2). Adjusted odds ratios for these two dentist perception outcomes about anxious patients generally improved strength of associations and confidence intervals. There were no meaningful differences by practice location or perceived public image. Also, there was no significant association between the use of pharmacological strategies for anxiety and the perceived stress of dentists. Nearly all dentists talked with anxious patients as their main treatment strategy. It was concluded that psychosocial aspects of dental practice have meaningful and often adverse associations with dentist perceptions about anxious patients. Some dentists appeared to require more knowledge about dental anxiety and managing their own stress.},

Abstract = {Aim: To assess how far causal attributions about abstinence and relapse, drinking self-efficacy, drinking locus of control expectancy and coping behaviour discriminate abstainers from relapsers following treatment for alcohol dependence.; Design: A multicentre 6-month follow-up study.; Setting: Mental health centres and self-help groups in Vizcaya (Spain).; Participants: The sample was formed by 201 alcoholics who were assessed at their centres and groups on two occasions: while they were in treatment and 6 months later.; Measurements: During treatment, participants completed several questionnaires related to cognitive and behavioural variables. Drinking problem and background variables were also assessed. Six months later their drinking status and treatment attendance were examined.; Findings: Multivariate tests showed that self-efficacy expectancy and long previous time in abstinence independently discriminated alcoholics who maintained abstinence from those who did not. Other cognitive-behavioural variables showed bivariate association with abstinence, but did not add predictive power to these two measures.; Conclusions: The results of this study are consistent with the extensive literature that confirms the predictor power of self-efficacy. Unexpectedly, it did not find independent positive relationships between other psychological variables and abstinence. Given that self-efficacy can predict outcome in the medium term, it is suggested that treatment could target this variable.},

Abstract = {Evaluated the natural course of symptoms in Dutch servicemen who had been deployed in the 1992–93 peace operation in Cambodia in a prospective study. At 18-mo follow-up, a questionnaire was completed by 227 veterans who met a set case definition for symptoms in Cambodia veterans or who had sub-threshold scores. Initial measurement of fatigue severity, psychological well-being, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), trait-anxiety, self-efficacy, and causal attributions was used to evaluate predictors for self-reported improvement and low levels of fatigue at follow-up. 19% of the Ss reported complete recovery, 20% felt much better, 57% had the same complaints and 4% had become worse compared with their initial assessment. Self-reported improvement and less severe fatigue at follow-up were predicted by less severe fatigue at initial assessment and more perceived control over symptoms. Self-reported improvement was reported in a considerable percentage of Ss, whereas another substantial percentage of Ss continued to suffer with severe levels of fatigue and related symptoms. Predictors of improvement in Cambodia veterans and patients with chronic fatigue syndrome show similarities and also may bear importance for Gulf War veterans.

Abstract = {Background: Beliefs about the causation of schizophrenia could influence the attitudes patients' families adopt towards the patient and may also influence their help-seeking behaviour. Indian families have been typically described as often believing in causes like supernatural forces and therefore seeking help from magico-religious healers. In the changing mental health scenario in India, this impression needs verification.; Method: Key relatives living with 254 chronic schizophrenia patients were interviewed and asked to name the causes they believed were behind the illness. A list of possible causes was provided for the families to select from, and relatives were also encouraged to mention other possible causes, not featured in the list. The possible causes identified and the factors related to attributions made were analysed.; Results: A supernatural cause was named by only 12% of the families and as the only cause by 5%. Psychosocial stress was most commonly cited cause, followed by personality defect and heredity. A small number of families (14%) could not name any cause and 39% named more than one cause. Patient gender and education, duration of illness and the key relative's education and the nature of relationship were related to the type of causal attributions made.; Conclusion: Families living with patients suffering chronic schizophrenia receiving treatment in urban India rarely subscribe to the idea of supernatural causation of the illness. The causal attributions made by them are fairly rational and understandable, given the relative lack of exposure to proper information about the illness.},

Abstract = {Although the value of interdisciplinary collaboration between epidemiology and anthropology is both widely acknowledged and hotly contested, effective international health policy and multicultural health programmes require it. The EMIC framework for cultural studies of illness was developed in response to such needs, and a cultural epidemiology emerged from that framework as an interdisciplinary field of research on locally valid representations of illness and their distributions in cultural context. These representations are specified by variables, descriptions, and narrative accounts of illness experience, its meaning, and associated illness behaviour. Specialized interactive qualitative and quantitative research methods provide a descriptive account, facilitate comparisons, and clarify the cultural basis of risk, course, and outcomes of practical significance for clinical practice and public health.

Such questions motivated development of this study of the cultural experience and meaning of depression amongst white Britons in London, involving development of a British EMIC interview for depression by adapting an earlier version of the EMIC used in Bangalore, India. Steps in the process involved historical and ethnographic study of depression, and extensive pilot testing. This report focuses on the experience of depression with reference to patterns of distress and its meaning with reference to perceived causes.

Abstract = {Investigates the relationship, well documented in other studies, between negative attitudes concerning mental health problems and biological and genetic causal beliefs. The literature shows that the 'mental illness is an illness like any other' approach to destigmatization, which has been the major effort in this area in the past 50 yrs, has failed to improve attitudes. The present study used a questionnaire of 469 1st-yr undergraduate students (17–42 yrs of age). Results replicate previous findings that the public tends to reject biological and genetic explanations of mental health problems in favor of psychosocial explanations focused on negative life events. It also confirms the previous findings concerning biological and genetic causal beliefs and negative attitudes. These attitudes include perceptions that 'mental patients' are dangerous, antisocial, and unpredictable, and reluctance to become romantically involved with them. The amount of reported personal contact with people who had received psychiatric treatment was correlated with positive attitudes. Authors recommend that destigmatization programs consider abandoning efforts to promulgate illness-based explanations, and focus instead on increasing contact with and exposure to users of mental health services.

Abstract = {Notes that patients' motivational characteristics are of crucial importance for the effectiveness of inpatient psychotherapy. In the present study of 250 patients (aged 17–64 yrs) from a German psychotherapy ward, 4 dimensions of motivation for psychotherapy (negative illness consequences, psychosocial lay etiology, psychotherapeutic treatment expectations, openness to psychotherapy) were assessed using a questionnaire measure of psychotherapy motivation (Fragebogen zur Messung der Psychotherapiemotivation) and related to pre- and posttherapy changes in symptomatology. Psychological symptoms as well as interpersonal problems were considered indicators of treatment effects. Results support the expectation that a psychosocial causal attribution of illness symptoms and a marked general openness to psychotherapy at the pretreatment interview predict more positive treatment outcomes. In the subsample of patients with somatization/dissociative disorders low in openness, an increased risk of ineffective treatment was evident. Implications of the results of pretreatment interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Brought up by alienists long ago, the question of awareness of illness has once again struck psychiatrists because of its diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Using X. Amador's scale to assess Unawareness in Mental Disorders, the authors evaluated a cohort of 90 patients presenting with the following diagnoses: 37 suffered from schizophrenia with psychotic symptoms (PS), 14 from a schizoaffective disorder with PS, 18 from bipolar disorder with PS, 7 from unipolar disorder with PS, and 14 from unipolar disorder without PS. Statistical analysis of results confirmed that awareness of illness was significantly weaker in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Furthermore, causal attribution of symptoms and social consequences of disorder were significantly less correct in these patients. Finally, these results reflect those of recent studies by P. Bebbington and R. White (e.g., 1999) on social context of insight. The authors question whether poor insight in certain mental disorders is a symptomatic dimension or whether it is linked to social and cultural differences between the patient and his/her therapist.

Abstract = {The health beliefs of people suffering from mental health problems are important. Such beliefs have been identified as key factors in models of health and illness behaviour, and may therefore indirectly influence clinical outcome. In addition, the increasing move towards patient-centred health care suggests that such beliefs need to be identified if a patient's perspective of his or her illness is to be addressed in the care process. Past research on health beliefs surrounding depression have concentrated on identifying "explanatory models" among the general community or among people who already have an established diagnosis of depression. This paper describes the content and status of health beliefs among people who are in the process of receiving a diagnosis. In-depth interviews were carried out with new referrals to a community mental health team (CMHT). Individuals expressed a variety of perceived causes throughout the interview. Beliefs were therefore characterised as changeable. It is argued that the concept of an "explanatory model" is too fixed to fully convey the fluid status of beliefs among this patient group. The concept of an "exploratory map" is suggested as a replacement. Such maps outline the avenues of thought which individuals explored when attempting to understand why they were currently experiencing particular psychological problems.

Abstract = {The present study investigated the effect of the Weiner stability-expectancy principle on unexpected outcomes in goal planning in a sample of key workers (mean age 31.86 yrs old) within a community health trust. 422 actual goal attainment scales were constructed, with each scale describing the key workers' expected levels of outcome. 226 (54%) unexpected outcomes, both successful and unsuccessful, were then rated by key workers to provide a causal explanation for each outcome. These explanations were then grouped according to whether the attributions represented stable or variable causes. Finally, key workers were asked to provide a new expectancy rating to forecast future goal attainment. Two predictions from Weiner's model were confirmed by statistical analysis: (1) that success attributed to stable factors would lead to higher revised forecast of goal attainment than success attributed to variable factors; and (2) that failure attributed to stable factors would lead to lower revised forecasts of goal attainment than failure attributed to variable factors. The results of the present study confirm that stability attributions do alter key workers' revised forecasts of goal attainment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore whether Latino beliefs of the causes of a contemporary medical illness (hypertension) and psychological illness (depression) involve traditional cultural explanations of health and illness. The relationship between health beliefs and help-seeking behaviors was investigated as well. Participants in this study were 201 Latino adults from three health clinics in Los Angeles, California. Data was collected by means of the Latino Beliefs about the Causes of Illness Questionnaire (LBCI-Q) developed by the principal investigator for this study. This study employed a correlation design. It was hypothesized that four causal dimensions for the two illnesses would emerge from the LBCI-Q, that would reflect a connection between the mind, body, spirit, and social realm: Supernatural Dimension, Interpersonal/Social Dimension, Natural Dimension, and Patient Dimension. In addition, it was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between supernatural type of causes (e.g., witchcraft/spells) and traditional help-seeking behaviors (e.g., traditional healer). Finally, it was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between patient kinds of causes (e.g., diet, exercise) and western help-seeking behaviors (e.g., medical services). Principal Components Factor Analysis was used to test the first hypothesis. Five factors, instead of four, emerged in the factor analysis for each illness. These factors or casual dimensions provided moderate support for the hypothesis that Latino beliefs about the causes of hypertension and depression involved individual, family, community, natural, and supernatural causal agents. Exploratory analysis revealed that ethnicity, generation level, and education level influenced which causal dimensions were viewed as playing significant causal roles for hypertension and depression. A Pearson's R product-moment correlation coefficient was used to test the second and the third hypotheses. The results indicated that the type of help a person seeks when ill are related to the underlying causal beliefs a person holds. Latinos more closely tied to traditional cultural explanations were more likely to seek traditional support (e.g., traditional healer). On the other hand, Latinos more closely tied to western biomedical explanations were more likely to seek western support (e.g., medical doctor). The limitations of the study, contributions to the field of psychology, clinical implications, and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Abstract = {Surveyed 102 mothers of inner-city youths with mental health problems and their 38 clinicians (aged 25-53) to examine discrepancies in mothers' and professionals' causal and solution attributions for children's problems. The questionnaire solicited information about a range of children's problems, then used a funnel technique to focus respondents' answers on the main problem with which they were concerned. Identical questions were given to mothers and professionals about the attributions of responsibility they made to various people, institutions, and situations for causing the problem and for finding solutions to it. Results show that greater causal responsibility was attributed to mothers by professionals than by mothers, while they agreed on the children's responsibility. Mothers and clinicians disagreed about their respective solution responsibilities, though agreeing that causally responsible children should help with solutions. Mothers considered many more community resources for solutions than did professionals. Implications for improvement of services to urban children are discussed.

Abstract = {Ability to study and evaluation is only one example of performance among many others but research and publications concerning this issue for more than 50 years, especially in the context of test anxiety and need of achievement, conferred upon it a prototypical dimension. Investigations about motivation also stimulate many scientists and constitute another foundation of this study (13). The level of performance depends on knowledge and motivation (33). Time devoted to study is essential to succeed; so motivation and procrastination are in competition. The importance of reinforcement (extrinsical motivation) and the desire for learning and knowing (intrinsical motivation) are determinant. Other elements must be emphasized: guarantee of obtaining rewards, self efficacy and causal attribution. These considerations point out the multidimensional and interactive aspects of test anxiety (7, 31). The number of components is not described unanimously but experts agree with emotional, cognitive and behavioral dimensions (25). So, anxiety was approached in its motivational properties, and it was the case until the sixties, in terms of drive corresponding to a need like thirst or hunger (18); then it was conceptualized in a dynamic context broader than that of stress and coping (29, 30). Last, it constitutes the object of theories highlighting cognitive interference (9, 23, 26) or defective skills (8, 32). A lot of questionnaires were built without answering the different aspects and for instance without linking the theoretical and therapeutic components concerning this problem. Committed to the traditional fields of research (test anxiety and need of achievement), to Weiner's work about attribution theory (34) and that of Bandura in self efficacy (4, 5), E. Depreeuw (10) was particularly interested in Heckhausen's model (16, 17), trying to associate experimental conceptions with the clinical reality. On this basis, he elaborated the TASTE (10, 12, 20): test for ability to study and evaluation. At first constituted of 121 items, the self-questionnaire, after factorial analysis, was reduced to 78 items assessing 4 factors which represent the 8 components of Heckhausen's model (16). The first factor (30 items) concerns anxiety in its emotional and cognitive characteristics. Interesting data were observed by Depreeuw and confirmed in the Netherlands and in Greece (19), especially the fact that anxiety of girls is higher than that of boys when they are confronted with an exam. The second one (19 items) represents self-confidence: confidence in ability to succeed and on using adequate strategies. The third factor (14 items) squared with value attributed to performance. It especially comments on the intrinsical component of motivation. The fourth factor (15 items) corresponds to procrastination; study is postponed on behalf of activities which actually reduce the achievement process. The self-report questionnaire (where answers run from total disagreement to total agreement whether they correspond to the way of thinking or acting) takes account of the emotional, cognitive and behavioral dimensions of the model. The multidimensional aspect of this questionnaire, but mainly its connections with theory and clinic, are convincing; we adopted it with other tests in research about fear of failure. Validation of the French translation is the subject of this article. In order to realize this operation, we chose the initial version of TASTE (121 items) to assess a Belgian sample of french-speaking students in the first year of University of Liège (n = 617). They are differentiated by gender, faculty (Economy, Medicine, Philosophy, Psychology, Applied Sciences) and experience of failure, i.e. the fact of repeating a school year. Statistics were realized with SPSS and SAS. A comprehension test and a back translation are satisfactory. The stability over time too: the one week test-retest was achieved with a sample of 33 student nurses; comparing the factors two by two, intra-class correlations ranged from 0.5 to 0.95. The component analysis with Varimax rotation does not allow us to find the four factors of construction. We obtain the same disappointing results with the version of 78 items. According to the screentest, we adopted the solution of five factors which confirms the original construction. A fifth particularly strong factor (Cronbach's alpha 0.82) corresponds to devalorisation. The internal reliability is very satisfactory. If we consider the items strong loading (more than 0.30), the French version is constituted of 94 items. If we consider the items which are specifically loading each factor, we can reduce the questionnaire to 50 items. Internal reliability remains the same. Correlations between the data obtained with this brief version are satisfactory; comparing the factors in pairs. Pearson's coefficients range from 0.8 to 0.89. The study of E. Depreeuw was realized ten years ago with a Belgian sample of Flemish-speaking students; is the cultural context or an evolution in test anxiety which explains such a difference in the results? We are now assessing a sample in another country which used the TASTE in 1996 in order to have some information about comparison of samples. In any case, the questionnaire of E. Depreeuw respects the multidimensional aspect of test anxiety. Our choice of 5 factors according to principal components confirms the original structure of the test but also discriminates another factor which could be predictive of psychopathology (panic, depression). This new dimension measures negative perception of ability and achievement especially when compared with other students. One aim of such a study is to discern clusters of students i.e. groups of students with characteristics such as Covington (7), Depreeuw (20) and Zeidner (35) describe them. This description is very important; the French version is only a part of a very broader study including other tests and could differentiate student's profiles. The French version of 5 factors finally gives results in agreement with the original. The items (10 per factor) are selected according to their highest specificity and after elimination of redundancy. Validity remains in the short version, making it more useful in clinical practice.},

Abstract = {This research addressed the causal beliefs about, and the help seeking preferences for depression, held by 676 Chinese lay people from four distinct groups (university, urban, rural and clinical), as well as the causal beliefs about depression held by 98 Chinese health care professionals. The influence of factors such as levels of depressive symptoms and clinical status on causal beliefs and help seeking preferences was also examined. The results indicated that the Chinese lay people and health care professionals surveyed in this study hold similar and sophisticated psychosocial causal theories of depression that resemble those held in the 'West', and that, in general, Chinese lay people favour psychosocial interventions and self-help in overcoming depression. A factor analysis of the 26 causal attributions studied revealed seven clearly interpretable factors. These 'Causal Factors' were labelled; Biological/fatalistic, Environmental stress-downtrodden, Family problems, 'Lacks Inner Resources', Negative-depressing influences, Unfulfilled Aspirations and Poor Health/Environment. The Causal Factors receiving the highest endorsements in the aetiology of depression were 'Lacks Inner Resources' and 'Family problems'. A factor analysis of the 16 help seeking alternatives studied revealed four clearly interpretable factors. These 'Help Seeking Factors' were labelled; Traditional/Western medical, Supernatural/folk, Social support/self-help and Mental health professional. The Help Seeking Factors receiving the highest endorsements were 'Social support/self-help' and 'Mental Health Professional'. Strong positive correlations were found between the Causal Factors 'Biological/fatalistic' and 'Poor Health/Environment' and the Help Seeking Factors 'Traditional/Western medical' and 'Supernatural/folk'. There was also a significant effect of the level of depressive symptoms and clinical status (whether or not subjects were in treatment for depression) on subjects' ratings of both causal beliefs and help seeking preferences. Weak, but statistically significant, correlations were found between the severity of depressive symptoms and the 'Supernatural/folk' and the 'Traditional/Western medical' help seeking factors. A moderate and negative correlation was found to exist between clinical status and the 'Family problems' causal factor. Clinical status was moderately and positively correlated with the Mental health professional and Traditional/Western medical help seeking factor. The results are discussed with respect to understanding the nature and impact of causal models of depression on help seeking with a view to better targeting of interventions for depressed Chinese people.

Abstract = {The authors describe the barriers related to socio-professional integration of people with severe mental disorders according to different perspectives of various people involved. Focus groups (22) have been conducted in almost every region in Quebec involving 87 participants in vocational rehabilitation programs, 47 non participants and 51 employers. Eighty (80) vocational program administrator completed a questionaire. The barriers identified by these groups are compared with those described in other studies. It seems that the results are similar: the main obstacle is prejudice towards mental illness and people with mental disorders, no matter who is questionned. Barriers to socio-professional integration are reviewed according to the theories of feeling of self-efficiency (Bandura, 1977,1997), causal attribution (Weiner, 1986) and planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991, 1996). Analysis of barriers to socio-professional integration carried out in the light of these three theories, allows to suggest points of reference for new tools and integration strategies.},

Abstract = {While there is ample evidence that the prevalence rates for major depressive disorder (MDD) in the general population are higher in women than in men, there is little data on gender differences as regard to symptoms, causal attribution, help-seeking, coping, or the consequences of depression. The large DEPRES Study dataset (including wave I and wave II) covering representative population samples of six European countries was analyzed for gender differences. In wave I marked gender differences were found in the 6-mo prevalence rate for major depression but less so for minor depression; the gender differences for major depression persisted across all age groups. Even after stratification by clinically significant impairment and paid employment status, men reported fewer symptoms than women; as a consequence, men reached the diagnostic threshold less often. In wave II there were clear gender differences in causal attribution and in coping. Men coped by increasing their sports activity and consumption of alcohol and women through emotional release and religion. Women felt the effects of depression in quality of sleep and general health; men felt it more in their ability to work. Implications and potential shortcomings are discussed.

Abstract = {It is difficult to specify the diagnostic significance of medically unexplained somatic symptoms and to rely on them to distinguish common mental disorders. In a prospective study we assessed somatic symptoms, patients' perceived causes of their illness and how these accounted for the dual diagnosis and course of common mental disorders. We found a frequent diagnostic overlap (79,6%) between somatoform, depressive and anxiety disorders. The analysis of patients' causal attribution showed that elements of an illness explanatory model enhance the conceptualisation of somatisation and that they are valid indicators of comorbidity and clinically significant features of common mental disorders.

Abstract = {Theoretical models and emerging empirical data suggest that the emotional reactions of staff to challenging behaviours may affect their responses to challenging behaviours and their psychological well-being. However, there have been few studies focusing on factors related to staff emotional reactions. Seventy staff working in educational environments with children with intellectual disability and/or autism completed a self-report questionnaire that measured demographic factors, behavioural causal beliefs, behavioural knowledge, perceived self-efficacy, and emotional reactions to challenging behaviours. Regression analyses revealed that behavioural causal beliefs were a positive predictor, and self-efficacy and behavioural knowledge were negative predictors of negative emotional reactions to challenging behaviours. Staff with formal qualifications also reported more negative emotional reactions. No other demographic factors emerged as significant predictors. The results suggest that behavioural causal beliefs, low self-efficacy and low behavioural knowledge may make staff vulnerable to experiencing negative emotional reactions to challenging behaviours. Researchers and clinicians need to address these issues in staff who work with people with challenging behaviours.},

Abstract = {This study addresses lay illness understanding and attributions, including attribution of blame, in wives of myocardial infarction (MI) patients concerning the causes of MI. The present study also investigates the association between illness attributions and emotional adjustment, and the associations of relevant third variables with illness attributions. A sample of 37 wives were interviewed during the acute phase of the illness, three months and 10 years post-index MI. Attributions of the MI to multiple causes were common with an strong emphasis on psychosocial risk factors, but attributional content showed a low consistency over time. In retrospect, the wives believed they could have done more to prevent the MI, but self-blame was not a significant issue. However, they blamed the patient for not taking preventive actions. Attributions were not related to background and illness characteristics or denial in any strong and consistent manner. In a short-term perspective, attributing the MI to stress causes and husbands' personality was associated with worse emotional adjustment. Also, the use of magical explanations and blame of the patient were related to a poorer emotional outcome for the wife. The causal attributions made by the wives during the acute phase did not influence the emotional adjustment after 10 years.},

Abstract = {Ethnic matches between mental health providers and clients have been suggested as a strategy for improving the cultural responsiveness of services. Although the research has been limited, the practice has received some empirical support. However, ethnic match may not be a sufficient condition for cultural responsiveness. To examine this possibility, we interviewed Dominican mothers (mean age 34.8 yrs old) of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on: their children's behaviors, the identification process, diagnosis, causal attributions, management strategies, help-seeking efforts, school relationship and performance, and relationship with school personnel. We interviewed the families' Latina clinicians on their perspectives on maternal understanding and practices. Maternal and clinicians' narratives were analyzed qualitatively to develop a portrait of maternal schemas and of clinicians' schemas of the mothers. The narratives reveal widely differing perspectives and illustrate the collisions that can occur between mothers and clinicians in the treatment process despite an ethnic match.

Abstract = {Background: Quality of life after cancer treatment becomes more important as the number of long-term survivors increases. This study aimed to investigate complaints of fatigue after treatment for breast cancer.; Patients and Methods: The study patients were 150 women who had finished curative treatment for breast cancer by a mean of 29 months before commencement of this study. Measurements included computerised questionnaires and a daily Self-Observation List.; Results: Thirty-eight per cent of the sample were severely fatigued, compared with 11% in a matched sample of women without a history of cancer. No association was found between fatigue and former treatment. The 'severely fatigued disease-free breast cancer patient' scored more 'problematic' on psychological well-being, functional impairment, sleep disturbance, physical activity, social support, neuropsychological and social functioning compared with the 'non-severely fatigued disease-free breast cancer patient'. Furthermore, the severely fatigued patients had a lower sense of control with respect to their fatigue complaints and stronger breast cancer- and psychologically-related attributions with regard to the causes of fatigue compared with the non-severely fatigued patients. Regression analyses indicated that sleep disturbance, physical activity and causal attributions contributed significantly to the subjective experience of fatigue.; Conclusions: Severe fatigue is a problem for almost 40% of the sample of breast cancer survivors. Severe fatigue is related to physical, psychological, social, cognitive and behavioural factors.},

Abstract = {The construct of expressed emotion (EE) refers to the emotional attitudes towards a patient with a mental disorder by his or her relative(s). Relatives who are highly critical, hostile, or emotionally overinvolved are considered high EE. The utility of expressed emotion for predicting the course of schizophrenia has been demonstrated; however, little is known about the nature of EE. Studies in the U.S. and England demonstrate that EE is related to relatives' causal beliefs of the schizophrenia patient's negative behaviors. However, such a link has not been assessed in China, where cultural attribution patterns and causal models of schizophrenia differ from Western countries. The present study examined the relationship between relatives' causal attributions and EE by examining 48 Camberwell Family Interviews (a semi-structured interview used to measure EE) collected from 1990-1999 in three cities in China. Spontaneous causal attributions were extracted from these interviews using the Leeds Attributional Coding System. Relatives' causal attributional styles were predicted to be associated with type of EE and also with ratings of how stigmatized the patient and family perceived themselves to be. Causal attributions and EE were then compared for their ability to predict patient relapse at 18 months after discharge. Attributional variables were not found to be significantly associated with perceived stigma. However, consistent with theoretical predictions, among attributional variables indicating that the patient played a causal role in his or her own negative behaviors, high critical and high critical/hostile EE groups articulated attributions that were more controllable and personal to the patient than high emotionally overinvolved and low EE groups. Among attributional variables indicating that the relative played a causal role in the patient's negative behaviors, high EE groups made more internal and controllable attributions to the relative than low EE groups. A combination of EE measures with controllability and personal attributional variables significantly predicted relapse at 18 months among Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Although there was a trend for EE alone to predict relapse at 18 months, controllability and personal attributions by the relative incrementally improved predictive validity when considered in conjunction with EE.

Abstract = {Literature on mental illness stigma exists in several disciplines including social psychology and sociology. The existing research is primarily descriptive and confirms that public attitudes toward people with mental illness are generally negative. Building on the existing knowledge, this study will integrate political ideology and labeling theory perspectives into an attribution model to understand the nature of mental illness stigma and the determinants of discriminatory behavior towards individuals with mental illness. Data from the vignette experiment contained in the MacArthur Mental Health Module of the 1996 General Social Survey is used to examine the influence of political ideology, causal attributions, illness course, and perceptions of dangerousness on several types of behavior. Results of path analysis with manifest variables suggest that while perceived dangerousness and illness condition were the primary predictors of desire for social distance; conservatism, illness condition, attributions of bad character, dangerousness, and beliefs about illness course are significant predictors of support for coercive treatment. Political ideology was the only significant predictor of support for government provision of mental health services. Thus, the analysis suggests that cognitive processes may differ depending on the behavioral outcome in question. This would indicate that stigma change strategies should be tailored to specific desired behavioral outcomes. This study was based on a deliberative attributional cognitive process. Future research should examine both deliberative and automatic cognitive processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Little is known of how homeless and other urban poor populations have fared during the robust economy and within structural changes in health care delivery and entitlement programs of the 1990s. This is important in determining the need for population-specific services during a vigorous economy with low unemployment and increasing Medicaid managed-care penetration. This study compared health insurance status and availability of a source for usual medical care, psychiatric and substance abuse comorbidities, and perceived causes of homelessness in homeless adults surveyed in 1995 and 1997. Cross-sectional, community-based surveys were conducted in 1995 and 1997 at sites frequented by urban homeless adults residing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Self-reported medical, mental health, and substance abuse comorbidities, health insurance, and source for usual care were measured. Compared to the 388 individuals surveyed in 1995, the 267 homeless adults surveyed in 1997 had more medical comorbidity (56.6% vs. 30.2%, P <.001) and mental health comorbidity (44.9% vs. 36.9%, P =.04) and required more chronic medication (52.1% vs. 30.3%, P <.001). More respondents in 1997 than 1995 reported having no health insurance (41.4% vs. 29.4%, P <.001). While there was no difference in the overall proportion reporting a source for usual care (78.3% in 1997 vs. 80.2% in 1995, P =.55), fewer persons reported use of the emergency department and more persons reported using a shelterbased clinic for usual care in 1997 compared with 1995. These findings suggest more need for medical care among homeless and urban poor persons in 1997 compared with 1995 and support the continued need for outreach and support services despite a vigorous economy.},

Abstract = {Assessment by psychologists is part of the routine multi-disciplinary admission process to secure facilities for those with a diagnosis of severe mental illness and an offending history. Non-engagement with the assessment process is a common clinical phenomenon. Using a survey design, this paper reports on the administration of the Gudjonsson Blame Attribution Inventory, (a questionnaire which elicits causal attributions about offending) to a cohort of consecutive male and female admissions to a medium secure unit, and a maximum security hospital (mean age 31.20 yrs). Reasons for non-compliance with the assessment process are examined. The responses of those who completed a series of questionnaires are compared using unit, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis and index offence as group variables. With regard to attribution of blame for index offence, contrary to prediction, those with a history of psychosis, rather than personality disorder, obtained higher external attribution scores. The implications of these findings for the assessment of blame and guilt feelings during the early stages of admission to a secure mental health service, and possible treatment implications, are considered.

Abstract = {This study focused on investigating the extent to which the achievement and attributional strategies individuals deploy influence their success in dealing with the transition from school to work, and whether their success or failure in this particular would have consequences for the kinds of strategy they deployed later in life. Two hundred and fifty young adults filled in the Cartoon-Attribution-Strategy Inventory, a revised version of Beck's Depression Inventory, and a work status questionnaire at the beginning of the last spring term of their curriculum, four months after their graduation, and a year and a half after it. The results showed that the deployment of maladaptive strategies, such as passive avoidance, led to problems in dealing with the transition from school to work. In turn, young adults' problems in dealing with this transition decreased their use of self-serving causal attributions, which was also found to lead to increased depressive symptomatology.

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper focuses on mothers' beliefs about their child's personality and development (stability or change and causal attributions) and how these beliefs can be affected by mothers' experience (being a mother of a 6 or of a 12-yr-old child and being a mother of a normally-developing or of a mentally disabled child). The scales were completed by several samples of mothers. The effect of the temporal orientation (retrospective or perspective) was also considered. The results show that the mothers rate their child with an optimistic bias while the mothers of disabled children are less positive than those of the broad-ranging sample. The results are also in accordance with the decrease of positiveness as the child grows. Finally, the optimistic bias differs in function of the temporal orientation for the mothers of normally-developing children and for the mothers of mentally disabled children. The retrospective change is also overestimated with regard to the prospective one in the broad-ranging sample. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the degree to which posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms account for fatigue in Dutch military veterans who returned from the peace operation United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia. 1,698 Dutch military veterans (mean ages 35.2-36.4 yrs) who participated in the peace operation completed surveys concerning fatigue, posttraumatic stress disorder, severe military experiences, subjective experiences, and physical and mental health. Results show that increased PTSD scores were found in 1.3% of Ss. There was no concordance between increased PTSD scores and reported fatigue. Ss with presumptive PTSD had more often left service, had more often been exposed to severe and potentially traumatic events, and more often reported a greater impact of the mission. These Ss reported more mental problems that they perceived to be service related and they held a stronger causal attribution to posttraumatic stress. It is concluded that presumptive PTSD cannot offer an explanation for fatigue in Cambodia veterans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Assessing lay beliefs about causes of depressive behaviour and analysing the influence of labelling and demographic factors on causal attributions.; Method: In Switzerland we conducted a representative telephone survey with 873 interviewees. A vignette depicting a man with depression satisfying the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-III-R criteria was presented. Content analysis of up to three answers about assumed causes was conducted.; Results: For more than half the respondents (56.6%) difficulties within the family or the partnership are causal for depression. Occupational stress is the second most-mentioned cause (32.7%), whereas unspecified further stress is in third place (19.9%). Traumatic events (17.9%), depressive disorder (14.1%) and further unspecified illnesses (11.6%) follow. Few correlations were found between causal attributions, labelling and demographic factors.; Conclusion: The respective causal attributions are mainly independent of demographic factors, thus generalizable for the population. The attributions are shaped primarily by psychosocial ideas about aetiology. Nevertheless, one-third of the interviewees holds biological or disease-related beliefs about causes of depression. The respective illness models cannot be neglected in the therapeutic relationship.},

Abstract = {Conflicting themes in the literature alternately suggest that involvement in the Christian community can have either a beneficial or a harmful effect upon individuals' mental health. A theoretical model is proposed to explain the positive and negative effects that Christian social support has upon individuals experiencing symptoms of depression. It is proposed that causal attributions about depression found within the conservative Christian community mediate the quality of social support. Abramson, Seligman and Teasdale's (1978) formulation of three dimensions of causal attributions is used to analyze a sample of attributions about depression observed by the authors within the conservative Christian community. It is theorized that the beneficial or harmful impact of various attributions about depression is not primarily related to the accuracy of the attributions, but rather to how these attributions fall along these three dimensions. Whether social support is depression-buffering or depression-maintaining is hypothesized to be an effect of the quality of the attributions made about the depressive symptoms and the helping behaviors that logically proceed from these attributions.

Adolescents who are less inclined to blame others for their problem and who value professional competence are probably more accepting of interventions and more compliant. Further research in this area is necessary.

Abstract = {In this study, we build on previous work by developing and estimating a model of the relationships between causal attributions (e.g., controllability, responsibility), familiarity with mental illness, dangerousness, emotional responses (e.g., pity, anger, fear), and helping and rejecting responses. Using survey data containing responses to hypothetical vignettes, we examine these relationships in a sample of 518 community college students. Consistent with attribution theory, causal attributions affect beliefs about persons' responsibility for causing their condition, beliefs which in turn lead to affective reactions, resulting in rejecting responses such as avoidance, coercion, segregation, and withholding help. However, consistent with a danger appraisal hypothesis, the effects of perceptions of dangerousness on helping and rejecting responses are unmediated by responsibility beliefs. Much of the dangerousness effects operate by increasing fear, a particularly strong predictor of support for coercive treatment. The results from this study also suggest that familiarity with mental illness reduces discriminatory responses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The importance of providing culturally-competent treatment is increasingly being emphasized in the mental health literature. However, the effect of religion as a cultural determinant of treatment utilization is largely understudied. Previous studies suggest that religious fundamentalists are more likely to endorse spiritual and demonic explanations for mental illness and are less willing to seek help from secular mental health professionals. However, these studies are based on small, regional, non-probability samples and have failed to adequately control for the effects of other sociodemographic variables such as education. This study utilized data from two nationally representative surveys, the 1996 and 1998 General Social Surveys (GSS), to examine the effect of beliefs about the authorship, inerrancy, and interpretation of the Bible on beliefs about the perceived causes and preferred treatments for mental disorders. Respondents who said that they believed the Bible was 'the word of God' and should be 'interpreted word for word' (Bible Believers) were more likely than other GSS respondents to say that the vignette subject's condition was caused by 'his or her own bad character.' However, Bible Believers were just as likely as other respondents to say that the condition was caused by 'a chemical imbalance in the brain.' Bible Believers were more likely than other respondents to say that the vignette character should 'talk to a minister, rabbi, priest, or other religious leader.' However, they were just as likely as other respondents to endorse that the vignette character 'go to a psychiatrist,' 'take prescription medication,' and 'go see a therapist or counselor, such as a social worker, psychologist, or other mental health professional.' Bible Believers were more likely than other GSS respondents to say that individuals should stop taking psychiatric medications as soon as symptoms subside. This study suggests that social workers should be aware of the potential clinical implications of Bible Believers' views regarding the causes and best treatments for mental disorders. It also suggests that more research is needed to further understand how these views may affect the course and outcome of mental health treatments.

A qualitative study in the Kimberley and metropolitan Perth regions of Western Australia indicates there is a gulf between Aboriginal and western conceptualisations of mental health.

These treatments are hierarchically organised, and dependent on the perceived cause, severity, and type of practitioner required.

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate how the psychiatric label 'borderline personality disorder' (BPD) affected staff's perceptions and causal attributions about patients' behaviour. Mental health nursing staff compeleted a questionnaire containing descriptions of challenging behaviour in which the patient was described with a diagnosis of depression, schizophrenia or BPD. Participants were asked to identify a likely cause of the behaviour and then on a Likert-type scale rate attributions of internality, stability, globality and controllability. In addition they recorded their level of sympathy with the patient and their optimism for change. Patients with BPD attracted more negative responses from staff than those with a label of schizophrenia or depression. Causes of their negative behaviour were rated as more stable and they were thought to be more in control of the causes of the behaviour and the behaviour itself. Staff reported less sympathy and optimism towards patients with BPD and rated their personal experiences as more negative than their experiences of working with patients with a diagnosis of depression or schizophrenia. Staff regard patients with a BPD label to be more in control of negative behaviour than patients with a label of schizophrenia or depression.

Abstract = {Examined attributions, emotions, and help-giving of 24 relatively unacculturated Latino-Americans toward a family member with schizophrenia. 91% of Ss had been rated as low in expressed emotion (low-EE) in an earlier study. Low-EE refers to relatives who express few critical attitudes when talking about a mentally ill family member. In support of attribution-affect theory, relatives who reported feeling more compassion toward an ill family member also reported exerting more effort to help their relative cope with the illness. A qualitative analysis of relatives' views, values, and behaviors was also conducted. We observed the following three main categories of attributions: (1) most participants accepted the patient as having a legitimate illness, (2) the majority of participants viewed interpersonal problems or other external environmental stressors as causing or exacerbating the disorder, and (3) many participants implicated God in their causal attributions and also reported turning to religion as a source of hope and comfort in coming to terms with the patient's illness. Together, the quantitative and qualitative data suggest that efforts to augment positive or favorable emotions in key family members may be most important in establishing a low-EE family environment.

Abstract = {There is a growing trend to view depression as a biological illness rather than a psychosocial condition, even though there is no consensus as to what causes depression. Furthermore, there are mixed data on the impact of advocating the biological model. Aims: This study examined public perceptions concerning the etiology of depression as well as the relationship between such perceptions and treatment preferences, empowerment, and stigma. Survey techniques were used to assess how 66 college students view the etiology of depression. Etiology beliefs, as well as demographic data, were regressed upon measures of treatment preference, empowerment, and stigma. Factor analysis produced three distinct models of etiology: biological, psychological, and environmental. Regression analyses showed that endorsement of the biological model was associated with increased empowerment, preference for psychotherapy, and decreased stigma. Endorsing the psychological model was associated with an increased belief that people can help themselves and increased stigma. Endorsing the environmental model was associated with a mixture of positive and negative beliefs concerning depression. The current public emphasis on viewing depression as biologically based should thus be viewed with some caution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Causal attributions of schizophrenia by 30 Chinese American caregivers in the Los Angeles area are investigated. Stress-related and biological explanations are most highly endorsed. Interpersonal and familial stress attributions reflect the sociocentric culture and centrality of family. A better match in causal attributions is key to improving interactions between mental health service providers and Chinese American patients and their caregivers. To this end, a stress-vulnerability model is suggested. Higher acculturation is also found to be positively associated with biological attributions of the illness, and supernatural attributions significantly relate to caregivers' objective and total burden. Implications of the findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Upon the success of the Islamic revolution in 1979 in Iran, a wave of persecution was initiated against women for different reasons. Religious belief (being a Bahai) has been among the various reasons for the persecution of women in Iran. This dissertation reviews the role of religious belief as a reason for being persecuted and as an important factor for maintaining psychological stability and mental health after experiencing persecution among Iranian Bahai women. This study is intended to emphasize that the perceived cause for persecution might evoke a sense of conviction and integrity that might influence the tolerance level for the persecution. It was hypothesized that the severity of torture is a stronger predictor of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder for the female victims of non-religious persecution in Iran compared to those women who were persecuted for their religious beliefs. In this empirical study the participants (50 Iranian women between the ages of 30 to 65, who were in Iran for at least two years after Islamic Revolution) were interviewed by using the Persian version of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). A relationship was found between the number of traumatic experiences and PTSD scores for the whole group, but the correlation between these factors did not hold when controlling for the religious group. T-tests revealed that those women who were persecuted for religious beliefs reported a significantly lower number of PTSD symptoms, despite a higher number of traumatic experiences. They also reported having a significantly weaker health condition, worse support system and were of older age than those persecuted for non-religious reasons. Using step-wise multiple regressions, other relevant predictors (e.g., demographic information) of severity of PTSD were also examined, but the reason for persecution was still found to remain as a significant predictor of PTSD above and beyond all these other factors.

Abstract = {Objectives. Although sensation and affect are well recognized as two principal dimensions of pain, it is still largely unknown how they function and interact in the experience of pain and what psychological factors may affect the specific aspects of pain experience. This study investigated the relationships of people's sensitivity to sensory stimuli (represented by sensory vigilance) and ability to process emotional information (represented by alexithymia status) to their experience of sensory, affective, and overall pains. Methods. Subjects were 159 individuals who reported some experience of pain within the week prior to their participation in the study. Subjects rated their sensory, affective, and overall pains on the Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) and the Pain Rating Index (PRI) of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, and completed questionnaires relating to sensory vigilance, alexithymia, psychopathology, pain features, and demographics. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the unique contributions of sensory vigilance and alexithymia to sensory, affective, and overall pains over and above demographic, pain feature, and psychopathological variables. Results. Sensory vigilance was significantly predictive of sensory pain based on the VASs, and sensory, affective, and total pains based on the PRI, when demographic, pain feature, and psychopathological variables were statistically controlled. Alexithymia status was not a unique predictor of any of the pain ratings. The results further indicated that sensory, affective, and overall pains based on the VASs and the PRI had very distinct profiles of unique predictors. VASs pain ratings showed greater associations with demographic variables, while PRI pain ratings had stronger relationships to sensory vigilance and pain causal attribution. Different combinations of unique predictors were also found between sensory and affective pains. Conclusion. Sensory vigilance is a significant predictor of pain experience over and above many other pain-correlates. Its potential influences on the experience of pain should be reflected in pain knowledge and treatment. Results also suggest that information about pain severity based on a single dimension and a single type of measure can be incomplete and problematic.

Abstract = {Rationale, Aims and Objectives: The assumption that the acquisition and mastery of the nursing process alone is sufficient to explain problem-solving performance has been challenged in recent literature. Researchers have argued that the quality of prior knowledge is a key component in explaining performance. In addition, motivational orientation and the quality of reasoning have been found to have different effects on performance in cognitive tasks. The aim of this study is to explore student nurses' clinical problem solving based on a model consisting of their motivational orientation, prior knowledge, diagnostic reasoning and diagnostic solutions. Methods: One hundred and thirty-five second-year nursing students completed the Study Process Questionnaire and the Causal Attribution Questionnaire prior to receiving five lectures on mental illness. A knowledge test and a clinical problem-solving task provided measures of prior knowledge, quality of diagnostic reasoning, and the quality and comprehensiveness of nursing diagnosis. A correlational design using pairwise correlations, hierarchical regression and path analysis examined the relationships among these data. Results and Conclusions: The results indicated an important role for a belief in personal control, for the accessibility and structuring of prior knowledge, and the quality of diagnostic reasoning, in generating high quality and comprehensive nursing diagnoses. The findings suggest that all contributing components of clinical problem solving need to be addressed in nursing education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the nature of the relationship between public causal beliefs and social distance toward people with mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia and depression. Despite the subjects' different cultural backgrounds, their responses show similar trends with regard to attributing depression and schizophrenia to psychosocial causes: 'acute stress' (life event) was most frequently endorsed as the cause for these two disorders. The biological causes ('brain disease' and 'heredity') were less frequently selected for depression than for schizophrenia. Irrespective of place and type of mental disorder, endorsing biological factors as the cause of schizophrenia was associated with a greater desire for social distance, the same relationship applies to depression in half the instances. It would be premature to draw conclusions with regard to interventions aimed at reducing discrimination based on stigma. However, our study provides stimulus for re-considering the assumptions underlying anti-stigma interventions: that promulgating biological concepts among the public might not contribute to a desired reduction in social distance toward people with mental disorders.

Abstract = {This paper comments on the study by Dietrich et al. (see record [rid]2004-14122-011[/rid]). This study investigates the important question of whether beliefs about the cause of mental illness are associated with desire for social distance, the latter serving as a proxy measure of discriminatory behaviour arising from stigmatizing attitudes. Using unlabelled vignettes depicting cases of major depressive disorder or schizophrenia, the authors surveyed the causal beliefs of people from three different cultures. In particular, they focused on the relationship between social, biological or other causal beliefs and social distance. Significantly, they conclude that biological causal beliefs ('brain disease' and 'heredity') are associated with greater social distance and suggest that current public campaigns to reduce stigma based on the concept of mental illness as biological in origin may be counterproductive.

Abstract = {Objective: Public social policies in New Zealand assume that there are fundamental differences between Maori views of health phenomena and non-Maori perceptions. The biomedical model and a Maori model known as Te Whare Tapa Wha are commonly employed to characterise these differences. Using the categorical ethnicity demarcation 'Maori/non-Maori' we investigate this claim with respect to mental health literacy about depression. Design: Participants were randomly selected from the General and Maori Electoral Rolls and recruited by post (N=205). A vignette methodology was employed and involved the development of a fictional character as a target stimulus who exhibited the minimum DSM-IV-R criteria for a major depressive disorder. Participants responded to items regarding problem recognition, well-being, causal attributions, treatment preferences, and likely prognosis. Results: The majority of Maori and non-Maori participants correctly identified the problem the vignette character was experiencing and nominated congruent attributions for the causes of the problem. In relation to treatment strategies and likely prognosis, independent of self-assigned ethnicity, participants rated professional treatments above alternative options. Overall the categorical ethnicity distinction 'Maori and non-Maori' produced no systematic variation with regards to individual evaluative responses about a major depressive disorder. Conclusions: Contrary to the embedded assumption within New Zealand's public health strategies that there are essential differences between the way Maori and non-Maori view health problems, and that the categorical ethnicity demarcation reliably reflects these differences, we found no evidence for the veracity of this claim using a major depressive disorder as a target for judgements. Alternative explanations are canvassed as to why this assumption about fundamental differences based on categorical ethnicity has gained ascendancy and prominence within the sphere of New Zealand health.

The priming effect of personal performance evaluations in inducing negative mental states, the mood-as-input hypothesis, and the manner in which state and trait emotions represent distinct sources of information are considered in relation to other factors that reinforce negative and dangerous behaviors.

Abstract = {Part I of this article introduces the interactional and discursive view of violence and resistance, part II illustrates its application to the analysis of sexual assault trial judgments, and part III provides a detailed analysis of an entire judgment. In giving their reasons for verdicts and sentences, the majority of judges accounted for the assaults by drawing on psychological concepts and constructs. These psychological explanations or causal attributions were grouped into one or more of eight categories: alcohol and drug abuse, biological or sexual drive, psychopathology, dysfunctional family upbringing, stress and trauma, character or personality trait, emotional state, and loss of control. The causal attributions in all categories systematically reformulated deliberate acts of violence into non-deliberate and non-violent acts. Psychologizing attributions, that is, causal attributions that functioned to conceal the violence and mitigate the perpetrator's responsibility, accounted for 97 percent of attributions. Through line-by-line analyses of the full text of one judgment, we show how psychologizing attributions are combined in use with other linguistic devices to (i) conceal violence, (ii) mitigate perpetrators' responsibility, (iii) conceal victims' resistance, and (iv) blame or pathologize victims.

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to measure causal beliefs in individuals with psoriasis and to explore their relationship with perceived stress, quality of life, psychological well-being and psoriasis severity. Methods: This study was cross-sectional in design, and patients were required to complete validated questionnaires assessing perceptions of illness, quality of life, psoriasis severity, perceived stress and psychological mood. A total of 141 individuals were recruited from two settings: an outpatient skin clinic at King's College Hospital and the Psoriasis Association. Results: A strong belief in stress/psychological attributes as a causal factor was found in 61% of the sample. This belief was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression and perceived stress (r≥.38; P≤.0001). Perceived stress in this sample was significantly associated with a poorer level of quality of life, higher levels of anxiety and depression (r≥.27; P≤.002) but not with psoriasis severity. Conclusions: The belief that stress is causal was associated with lower levels of psychological well-being. However, there was no association between perceived stress and more objective measures of psoriasis severity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Previous studies have indicated a robust link between relatives' causal attributions and levels of expressed emotion (EE). However, these studies have primarily been conducted in Western cultures. The current study, conducted in China, examined the spontaneous causal attributions made by 54 relatives of schizophrenia patients during the Camberwell Family Interview. Chinese relatives made few controllable and personal attributions overall. Yet as predicted, highly critical and/or hostile EE relatives attributed patients' negative behaviors to more controllable and personal factors. High EE and controllable attributions positively predicted relapse, whereas personal attributions unexpectedly protected against relapse. EE mediated the effect of controllable, but not personal, attributions on relapse. Relatives' use of a particular Chinese characteristic (narrow-mindedness) was integral to the personal dimension's protective effect. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Illness-related stigma is a complex and important issue, and its social impact contributes to a hidden burden of many health problems. Mitigating effects of stigma are a priority for mental health policy, especially for schizophrenia. Although numerous studies document its impact on patients and their families, health studies of stigma typically regard it in global terms without adequate attention to the conceptual and practical importance of sociocultural contexts and the particular features of illness that evoke stigma. Research at a psychiatric referral center in Bangalore, India, studied the cultural epidemiology of schizophrenia and stigma in interviews with family caretakers of 60 patients, using a locally adapted EMIC interview and the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale. An index of 13 stigma queries based on Goffman's formulation covered relevant aspects and proved to be internally consistent (Cronbach α = 0.81). Multivariate statistical regression and qualitative analysis of narratives were used to analyze this stigma index and identify explanatory variables based on cultural patterns of distress (PD), perceived causes (PC), and previous help seeking (HS). Significant variables included suspiciousness and inappropriate sexual behavior (PD), heredity and bad deeds (PC), and informal help seeking (HS). Previous allopathic help seeking was negatively associated with stigma. Analysis of coded text segments from' respondent narratives showed how these variables were related to family-perceived stigma, with reference to marriage practices, moral meanings of schizophrenia, and ways in which effective allopathic care minimized stigma. Findings identify features of schizophrenia-related stigma in India, contribute to comparative culture studies, and inform practical approaches to mitigate stigma through community awareness and improved mental health services.

Abstract = {Research into the nature of attributional reasoning in paranoia has for the most part been restricted to questionnaire-based approaches. This fails to address the issue of whether a distinctive attributional style underpins the everyday talk of paranoid individuals. This study aimed to investigate whether attributional models of paranoid delusions applied to spontaneous attributions generated in the discourse of 12 paranoid and 12 non-paranoid speakers. Causal attributions for negative and positive life experiences were extracted from interview transcripts and rated using the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations (CAVE) technique. It was found that, as a proportion, paranoids made more attributions for negative events that were of an external-personal, stable and global nature (as attributional models would predict). They also made significantly more external-personal attributions for negative events and, in one of two datasets, showed a more external mean CAVE rating for negative events than the non-paranoid controls. This paper highlights important issues underlying the extraction of attributions from paranoid talk, and discusses the implications for attributional models of paranoia and future discourse-based research in this area.},

Abstract = {A catastrophic event such as the onset of mental illness forces the patient's family members to make tremendous adjustment to the reality. Parents, siblings, and spouses of the mentally ill patients were interviewed in the United States and Japan with regard to how they perceived the cause of the illness of their loved ones. They struggle to make sense out of the tragedy by searching for the plausible reason for the illness. The perceived causes were mainly divided into two groups: (a) factors relating to the early family socialization and (b) genetic factors. Other possible causes included a traumatic event in later life, karmic influence based on the Buddhist perspective, and cult religion. However, few were convinced about their own theories as most wavered between different causal explanations and continued to question what caused it. The parents were often tormented by self-blame, and some family members still doubted the diagnosis and hoped the patient's problem was caused by drug addiction. Regardless of the accuracy of their causal attribution, their mental struggle is an important part of the cognitive adjustment process toward better acceptance of the mental illness in the family.

Results: Compared with age-matched pregnant control sample. The infertile women exhibited a significant higher psychopathology in all HADS parameters in the form of tension, hostility, anxiety, depression, self-blame and suicidal ideation. The illiterate group attributed the causes of their infertility to supernatural causes such as evil spirits, witchcraft and God's retribution, while the educated group blamed nutritional, marital and psychosexual factors for their infertility. Faith and traditional healers were considered as the first treatment choice among illiterate women, while the educated women opted for an infertility clinic for treatment. Childlessness results in social stigmatization for infertile women and places them at risk of serious social and emotional consequences. Conclusions: The prevalence and severity of psychological distress in this sample of infertile Kuwaiti women indicates the appropriateness of referring these patients for psychological evaluation. Successful programmes in dealing with infertility in Kuwait need to include the establishment of a community based intervention strategy to educate people about infertility and to give guidelines for treatment options.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study attempted to understand the psychological well-being of caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia and factors affecting the caregivers' psychological well-being. More specifically, quality of life and psychiatric morbidity were used to represent the psychological well-being. Personal interviews using questionnaires were administrated to 57 caregivers. Data regarding knowledge of schizophrenia, perceived causes of schizophrenia, quality of life and psychiatric morbidity was collected. Psychiatrists assessed the symptoms severity of the schizophrenic patients. Compared with the controls, the psychological well-being of caregivers of patients with schizophrenia was poorer. There was a significant association between the positive symptoms score and the psychological well-being of caregivers. Life quality and psychiatric morbidity were affected by caregivers' knowledge of schizophrenia and beliefs about the cause of schizophrenia. Health care providers should consider the patients and their caregivers as a whole and provide psychoeducation to reduce the negative psychological impact of caregivers.

Abstract = {Flood research has used a variety of methods, yielding inconsistent findings. Universal definitions of illness are paramount to the science of psychiatric epidemiology of disasters. St. Louis area survivors (N = 162) of the Great Midwestern Floods of 1993 received a structured diagnostic assessment at 4 and 16 months postdisaster, with 88% follow-up. The purpose of the assessment was to examine predisaster and postdisaster rates of disorders and symptoms. Flood-related posttraumatic stress disorder was diagnosed in 22% and 16% at index and follow-up, respectively. Comorbidity with major depression determined whether the posttraumatic stress disorder would have remitted by 1 year later. Nearly one half of the men in the sample had a pre-existing alcohol use disorder. Virtually no new substance abuse followed the floods, and hence, substance abuse did not develop in response to the disaster or as part of coping with its aftermath. Somatization disorder was not observed; new somatoform symptoms represented a fraction of postflood somatic complaints. Findings are inconsistent with causal attribution of floods in the etiology of alcohol abuse and somatization. Methodological differences may account for much of the apparent discrepancy of these findings, with recent reports of increased alcohol use and somatic symptoms observed after other disasters.

Abstract = {This research studied 27 families in Guadeloupe with children receiving mental health care, examining their illness experience, perceived causes, and help seeking for their children's disorders. These families were assessed with an appropriately adapted semi-structured interview based on the framework of the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue, developed by Weiss, for research in medical anthropology and cultural psychiatry. Cultural perceived causes elaborated by the families to explain their children's disorders were associated with traditional and popular help-seeking. They coexisted with biomedical and psychiatric perceived causes that were congruent with professional models and compatible with concurrent institutional help-seeking. Most families were also satisfied with their children's institutional mental health care. These findings indicate that the understanding by the families of the professional biomedical or psychiatric models may be complemented by local cultural meanings and traditional help-seeking, and without adverse effects on families' therapeutic alliance with mental health care institutions.

Abstract = {A survey of parents and caregivers of a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was conducted to examine the relationship between the way they perceived contributions and causation of autism and the way they evaluated their family quality of life. Having a child with autism places a number of burdens on the shoulders of the parents and other family members. Therefore the quality of life of these families might be altered as a result. Since family members' perceptions of disability influence the process of adaptation and adjustment of the family, this study examined how perceptions might ultimately relate to the family quality of life. In addition, the relationship between demographic variables such as income, child's age, parental education, depression, and satisfaction with services was also examined. Primary caregivers of a child with ASD from Illinois (N = 175) were surveyed concerning their perceptions of autism, their mental health, demographic factors, and their family quality of life. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the relationship between perceptions, demographic factors and quality of life was examined. Results suggest a significant relationship between perceptions of positive contributions of autism to the family and family quality of life. In addition, a significant relationship was found between each variable: child's age, income, and depression and the variable: family quality of life. No significant relationship was found between the way families perceived causes of autism and family quality of life. In addition, a qualitative analysis was conducted to examine family members' perceptions more closely. The results suggest that in general family members define the effects of autism on their personal life as positive as compared to the effects on the family as a unit. Positive contributions of autism were articulated to be family closeness, learned lessons in compassion, change of outlook of life, patience, and personal empowerment. Negative effects of autism were identified to be alteration of the family's functions, strained relationships and personal goals, and parental depression. Generally, parents had positive working models of their child with autism, and described their child in very affectionate terms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The assessment of somatoform disorders is complicated by persistent theoretical and practical questions of classification and assessment. Critical rethinking of professional concepts of somatization suggests the value of complementary assessment of patients' illness explanatory models of somatoform and other common mental disorders. We undertook this prospective study to assess medically unexplained somatic symptoms and their patient-perceived causes of illness and to show how patients' explanatory models relate to professional diagnoses of common mental disorders and how they may predict the short-term course of illness. Tertiary care patients (N = 186) with prominent somatoform symptoms were evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-FV, a locally adapted Explanatory Model Interview to elicit patients' illness experience (priority symptoms) and perceived causes, and clinical self-report questionnaires. The self-report questionnaires were administered at baseline and after 6 months. Diagnostic overlap between somatoform, depressive, and anxiety disorders occurred frequently (79.6%). Patients explained pure somatoform disorders mainly with organic causal attributions; they explained pure depressive and/or anxiety disorders mainly with psychosocial perceived causes, and patients in the diagnostic overlap group typically reported mixed causal attributions. In this last group, among patients with similar levels of symptom severity, organic perceived causes were related to a lower physical health sum score on the MOS Short Form, and psychosocial perceived causes were related to less severe depressive symptoms, assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 6 months. Among patients meeting criteria for comorbid somatoform with anxiety and/or depressive disorders, complementary assessment of patient-perceived causes, a key element of illness explanatory models, was related to levels of functional impairment and short-term prognosis. For such patients, causal attributions may be particularly useful to clarify clinically significant features of common mental disorders and thereby contribute to clinical assessment.

Abstract = {Utilizing the case vignette method, community attitudes about people with schizophrenia and mental disorders, and perceived causes of and images regarding schizophrenia were investigated. Participants comprised 1596 respondents living in the area covered by the K health center in N prefecture. The survey utilized the Mental Disorder Prejudice Scale, a case vignette, and other basic attributes. The case vignette survey yielded the following results: when asked about a landlord refusing to rent an apartment to the vignette subject, approximately 80% of respondents agreed with the landlord's decision. However, when asked about necessary conditions for the vignette subject to live in an apartment independently, only 2.4% of respondents chose 'difficult under any circumstance'. Approximately half of the respondents chose the following conditions: 'periodic visits to the hospital', 'availability of a system where people can discuss and address any problems that might arise' and 'attending a sheltered workshop or making attempts to rehabilitate'. Regarding acceptance as a neighbor after meeting the listed conditions, most respondents stated they would 'treat him just like any other neighbor' (47.3%), followed by 'help as much as possible in times of need' (36.3%). In other words, approximately 80.0% of respondents were willing to have the vignette subject as their neighbor. In addition, many respondents thought that schizophrenia is caused by problems in interpersonal relationships (64.8%) and represents an unstable disease (69.9%). When asked about having the subject as a neighbor, respondents were more willing to accept him as a neighbor after clarifying conditions for living arrangements.

Abstract = {This study addresses the factors which affect the self-esteem of persons with psychiatric disabilities, with a specific focus on the role of causal attributions of mental illnesses. It is based on data collected from 461 persons with psychiatric disabilities (consumers) served through psychiatric rehabilitation agencies. The results of regression analyses revealed that household income, diagnosis, psychiatric symptoms, service satisfaction, perceived stigma, and perceptions of social roles were all related to self-esteem. Consumers' causal attributions did not have direct effects on self-esteem, but the effects of causal attributions on self-esteem were moderated by psychiatric symptoms and by perceptions of social roles, suggesting that self-esteem enhancement strategies should be tailored to consumers' psychiatric and cognitive characteristics.

Abstract = {Background: It is a widely shared belief that an increase in mental health literacy will result in an improvement of attitudes towards people with mental illness. Aims: To examine how the German public's causal attributions of schizophrenia and their desire for social distance from people with schizophrenia developed over the 1990s. Method: A trend analysis was carried out using data from two representative population surveys conducted in the Länder constituting the former Federal Republic of Germany in 1990 and 2001. Results: Parallel to an increase in the public's tendency to endorse biological causes, an increase in the desire for social distance from people with schizophrenia was found. Conclusions: The assumption underlying current anti-stigma programmes that there is a positive relationship between endorsing biological causes and the acceptance of people with mental illness appears to be problematic.

Abstract = {Background: The effectiveness of parent management training (PMT) as a treatment for child behaviour problems is reduced by high attrition rates. One difficulty with engaging mothers is that, by definition, PMT is directed at the parent, yet many parents believe the cause of the problem lies within the child. Hence the model of therapy offered contradicts their understanding about the cause and nature of the problem. Moreover, the emotional consequence of holding child-responsibility causal attributions is associated with high expressed emotion (EE), a known predictor of poor compliance with therapy in other child psychiatric disorders. Methods: Seventy-five consecutive referrals of mothers to a PMT programme were recruited. EE was assessed using the Camberwell Family Interview methodology. Spontaneous causal attributions about their child's problem behaviour were collected from the same interview material and independently coded using the Leeds Attributional Coding System. Attendance data at the PMT programme was collected following completion of programmes. Results: Contrary to expectations, mothers who made child-responsibility attributions and were highly critical about their child's behaviour were no more likely than non-blaming, low EE parents to drop out prematurely from a course of PMT. However, expressing an understanding of their own role in managing their child's behaviour was predictive of attendance. Two factors were, however, more closely associated with greater attrition: having been offered a clinical diagnosis and being from a lower socio-economic family. Conclusions: Socio-economic factors should be viewed as barriers to uptake of services and successful strategies for increasing engagement of families are likely to be economical rather than psychological. However, although the causal attributions mothers make about their child's behaviour did not predict whether they were likely to attend PMT, an exploratory analysis found evidence to suggest that successful engagement with PMT begins early in the referral process and that referring clinicians should ensure treatment options are aligned with diagnoses provided.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the role of perceived stigma and attitudes to seeking care in predicting help-seeking from a general practitioner (GP) for mental health problems. Method: A cross-sectional survey in 2002 with self-report questionnaires assessing current levels of symptomatology, disability, attitudes towards mental illness, knowledge of prevalence and causes of mental illness, contact with mental illness and help-seeking behaviour and preferences and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help. Results: No significant relationship was found between symptom measures and measures of disability and help-seeking. Variables positively associated with general attitudes to seeking professional psychological help were: lower perceived stigma, and biological rather than person-based causal attributions for schizophrenia. Willingness to discuss mental health issues with a GP was predicted by the perceived helpfulness of the GP and by no other variable. Conclusions: Causal attributions and perceived stigma rather than participants' levels of symptomatology and disability influence attitudes to help-seeking for mental health issues. Efforts to improve attitudes to help-seeking should focus on reducing stigma and improving mental health literacy regarding the causes of disorders.

Abstract = {Background: Vaginal discharge is a common complaint, particularly among women in Asia. Although presumed to be caused by reproductive tract infections (RTIs), the association between the complaint and the presence of RTIs is weak. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors of the complaint of vaginal discharge.; Methods: We conducted a community-based survey of 3000 women aged 18-50 years, randomly sampled from a population in Goa, India. Women who gave informed consent were invited to participate in a structured interview, which elicited data on the primary outcome (the experience of current abnormal vaginal discharge) and psychosocial exposures: gender adversity; symptoms of somatoform disorders; and common mental disorders (CMD). All women were required to provide vaginal and/or urine samples for diagnosis of RTIs using gold standard laboratory tests. Risk factors were analysed using logistic regression with the binary outcome of the complaint of vaginal discharge.; Results: Of the 2494 women (83%) who agreed to participate, 14.5% complained of having an abnormal vaginal discharge. Stress was the most common causal attribution for the complaint. The final multivariate model found that high scores for CMD (OR 2.16, 1.4-3.2) and somatoform disorders (6.23, 4.0-9.7) and the use of an intrauterine contraceptive device (1.86, 1.0-3.4) were independently associated with the complaint. Low literacy (0.54, 0.4-0.8) and age >40 years (0.29, 0.2-0.4) were associated with a reduced risk. RTI were not associated with the complaint (1.24, 0.9-1.6).; Conclusions: Psychosocial factors have the strongest association with the complaint of vaginal discharge. Syndromic management algorithms need refinement so that women with complaints that are non-infectious in aetiology are offered psychosocial interventions.},

Abstract = {Background: Surveys of the public in a range of Western countries have shown a predominant belief in social stressors as causes of mental disorders. However, there has been little direct cross cultural comparison. Here we report a comparison of public beliefs about the causes of mental disorders in Japan and Australia. Methods: Surveys of the public were carried out in each country using as similar a methodology as feasible. In both countries, household interviews were carried out concerning beliefs about causes and risk factors in relation to one of four case vignettes, describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia or chronic schizophrenia. In Japan, the survey involved 2000 adults aged between 20 and 69 from 25 regional sites spread across the country. In Australia, the survey involved a national sample of 3998 adults aged 18 years or over. Results: In both countries, both social and personal vulnerability causes were commonly endorsed across all vignettes. The major differences in causal beliefs were that Australians were more likely to believe in infection, allergy and genetics, while Japanese were more likely to endorse 'nervous person' and 'weakness of character'. For risk factors, Australians tended to believe that women, the young and the poor were more at risk of depression, but these were not seen as higher risk groups by Japanese. Conclusion: In both Japan and Australia, the public has a predominant belief in social causes and risk factors, with personal vulnerability factors also seen as important. However, there are also some major differences between the countries. The belief in weakness of character as a cause, which was stronger in Japan, is of particular concern because it may reduce the likelihood of seeking professional help and support from others.

Abstract = {Background: Although attitudes towards psychiatric illness influence its presentation, detection, recognition, treatment adherence and rehabilitation, the lay public's opinions and beliefs about the treatment of depression have not been investigated sufficiently. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine public opinions and beliefs about the treatment of depression and the influence of perception and causal attributions on attitudes towards treatment of depression in urban areas. Methods: This study was carried out with a representative sample in Istanbul, which is the biggest metropolis in Turkey. Seven hundred and seven subjects completed the public survey form which consisted of 32 items rating attitudes towards depression. Results: The public believes that psychological and social interventions are more effective than pharmacotherapy, and that the medicines used in treatment of depression are harmful and addictive. There was a general reluctance to consult a physician for depression, and psychiatrists were felt to be more helpful than general practitioners. The public viewed depression as treatable. A high educational level and perceiving depression as a disease is associated with positive beliefs and opinions about the treatment of depression; but the perception of depressive patients as aggressive is associated with negative beliefs and opinions about the treatment of depression. Conclusion: The beliefs that 'psychological and social interventions are more effective than pharmacotherapy' and 'antidepressants are harmful and addictive' must specifically be taken into account in clinical practice and in anti-stigma campaigns. Additional studies are needed to understand the public's tendency to conceptualise depression as a psychosocial problem. In clinical practice, depression should be introduced as a bio-psychosocial disease whatever its cause: biological, psychological or social. In addition, the differences between extreme worry and disease, and the lack of aggressiveness of depressive patients, must be emphasised.

Abstract = {Since its introduction in 1980, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become an indispensable diagnosis in clinical practice and in research. The usefulness and great heuristic value of this newly created diagnosis are undisputed today. In spite of its obvious qualities, there have always been conceptual difficulties with the diagnosis, mainly concerning the crucial A-criterion. The A-criterion of PTSD (i.e. the trauma criterion according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) represents the conceptual core of the diagnosis. It is much owed to social and political stances of its original authors and stipulates a monocausal etiology of the disorder. This is in fact inadequate and misleading. Furthermore, the A-criterion is tautologic and therefore dispensable. It may be more appropriate to define PTSD strictly on the basis of descriptive, phenomenological terms and to omit the A-criterion, in order to avoid useless confusions about causal attribution.},

Abstract = {Purpose of review: The frequent co-occurrence of depression and somatic symptoms poses a continuing challenge to clinicians, researchers and experts involved in drawing up classifications. In this review we present recently published literature on aspects of epidemiology, classification and treatment in this important overlap area. Recent findings: From the multitude of papers published annually on the co-occurrence of different pain conditions and depression, temporomandibular dysfunction stands out this year by sheer quantity; it can be seen as a model case of the necessity for differentiated high-quality assessments on the biological as well as the psychosocial level. There is a general move to separate utility of diagnostic classifications from their validity, and this strengthens classificatory approaches that help to view the regular overlap of depression, pain and other somatic symptoms as the rule rather than the exception. The incorporation of cognitive variables like causal attributions should help to distinguish clinically relevant subtypes among overlap cases. The classificatory future of the category of 'somatoform disorders' is somewhat in doubt, but reforms seem to be more productive than abolishment. Psychopharmacology provides rather intense recent coverage of the overlap field, with newer dual serotonergic-noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors offering some promise. Summary: Treating the overlap of depression, pain and other somatic symptoms as the rule rather than the exception is necessary for adequate aetiological research as well as for diagnosis and treatment, with one-dimensional classificatory and treatment approaches almost certainly being insufficient.

Abstract = {Objective: The importance of causal attribution for Turkish and German patients with a psychotic disorder for the diagnostic process was examined. Methods: Within a controlled clinical study Turkish and German patients were interviewed regarding their concepts of cause of illness. Results: There was no difference between the two groups--in both around half the patients gave a response categorized under 'psychosocial stress', while in both groups only about one fourth gave culture specific responses, with no difference even when looking at potentially misdiagnosed cases. Conclusions: Culture specific causal attributions for psychotic disorders do not seem to be as important as the literature implies. Nonetheless insecurities in diagnostics and treatment make it necessary to acquire a better understanding of these views. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: According to learned helplessness theory; a set of cognitive, motivational, and emotional deficits and nonpersistence of goal directed behavior occur because of learning that there is noncontingency between behavior and outcomes. In this paper, it is aimed to review learned helplessness theory and associated motivational orientations and causal attributions within the developmental framework. In addition, environmental factors which may play a role in the development of learned helplessness are discussed in the light of the literature. In the last two sections, psychiatric and other medical disorders that are associated with learned helplessness are reviewed. Method: Researches and reviews were screened and developmental characteristics were summarized. Results: There are ambiguities about how early children may develop learned helplessness or how this process occurs. The view that behavioral pattern of learned helplessness does not occur until late childhood was dominated during the past several decades. In later studies, it was shown that helplessness behaviors may occur in younger children following repeated failure experiences. This helplessness experience, with its emotional, behavioral and cognitive reflections causes vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, especially to depression, and may have a negative impact on coping skills of children and families with chronic diseases. Discussion: Detecting helplessness behavior patterns which may have negative consequences at early ages and planning intervention strategies based on these patterns seem important in terms of successful treatment outcome.

Abstract = {The purpose of the current study was to further research on maternal attributions by addressing limitations in previous research. Attributions were coded from narrative interviews to limit problems such as unclear questionnaires and irrelevant hypothetical stimuli. Trait attributions were identified as well as causal attributions for specific experiences. Mothers' attributions were assessed for two children from each family to examine within family as well as between family differences in attributions based on gender and sibling status. Attributions for behaviors were coded separately from attributions for mental states to explore the importance of making this distinction. Coded attributions were correlated with several other parent and child variables to determine which are useful predictors of family functioning. Transcripts of interviews with mothers were reliably sorted into individual references to children's behaviors, mental states, or traits, and positive or negative valence was indicated. Causal attributions were then identified and reliably sorted into several categories that were compiled into scales similar to those addressed in previous research. Mothers made different types of attributions statements for older and younger siblings. They spoke more positively in general about older siblings, and made more negative, child-centered attributions about younger siblings. Mothers also differed in their attribution statements about boys compared with girls. More references were made to negative behaviors about boys, but boys were also described with more positive traits. Different patterns of causal attributions were also identified for boys and girls. Differences between attributions for behaviors and mental states were examined, and different patterns were apparent for boys and girls, although no sibling status differences were identified. Attribution scales were correlated with several family functions variables. Several important associations were identified. In general, more positive and less negative attributions were related to less harsh discipline by mothers, more mother-rated relationship satisfaction and less conflict, more positive and less negative mother-child interaction ratings, fewer child behavior problems, less negative child temperament ratings, more positive and less negative treatment by mothers, and better maternal responses to children's emotions. These patterns were generally more robust for older than younger siblings, and for girls as compared with boys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The phrase 'folk psychology' refers to the ordinary psychology we use to understand each other and ourselves. Although folk psychology may initially seem to be a rather simple sort of thing, it can actually be surprisingly difficult to figure out precisely how it works. One common view is that folk psychology is best understood as a tool for predicting and explaining behavior. The key idea here is that, if we attribute mental states to other people, we will be able to do a better job of predicting and explaining the behaviors they subsequently perform. Philosophers who hold this view often suggest that folk psychology is something like a scientific theory. The present dissertation argues for a radically different view. It suggests that folk psychology might be better understood as a kind of multi-purpose tool. Specifically, the claim is that folk psychology should be understood as a tool not only for generating predictions and explanations but also for generating moral judgments. The dissertation begins with a general theoretical defense of this approach. It then proceeds to apply the approach to three major aspects of folk psychology. The first of these is people's ordinary concept of intentional action. A series of experiments demonstrate that people's attributions of intentional action in particular cases can actually be influenced by their moral beliefs. This result suggests that moral considerations may actually be playing a role in the concept of intentional action itself. The second aspect is our ordinary practice of reason explanation. Here again, a series of experiments demonstrate the role of moral considerations and thereby suggest that morality may play a role in the relevant concepts. The final aspect to be considered is people's practice of causal attribution. Moral considerations have long been known to play a role in this practice; the claim defended here is that this role is best understood in terms of the nature of the concept of causation itself.

Abstract = {This study was designed to investigate social attribution processes as they pertained to reactions towards an individual with mental illness. Participants (N = 187) read a vignette describing an individual with one of three psychological disorders (schizophrenia, depression, ADHD). The information manipulated in the vignette included: the type of disorder, whether a formal diagnostic label was attached to the individual or only a description of the defining behavioral problems, and whether there was any situational information provided related to the individual's difficulties. Participants answered multi-question measures about the perceived causes of the individual's problem, perceived controllability, perceived stability of the condition, and perceived violence potential. In addition, participants reported affective reactions and social distance preferences. Data were subjected to a series of 3 x 2 x 2 MANOVAs and ANOVAs. Presence of Diagnostic Label significantly affected causal, stability, and controllability attributions of participants. Labeling also resulted in more positive affective reactions toward the target experiencing ADHD but had no significant impact on social distance preferences. Type of Diagnosis also yielded numerous significant effects in terms of perceived causality, stability, and affective reactions, particularly for the vignette depicting depressive difficulties. Presence of Situation significantly affected participants' causality attributions. Situational information led to greater positive affect, but only for those vignettes not containing a diagnostic label. While independent variables had numerous significant main effects, Situation X Diagnosis interactions, particularly those involving judgments of depressed targets, were most informative. Participants' familiarity and experience with those with mental illnesses had no main effects for any of the dependent variables. However, a significant three-way interaction effect for Situation X Diagnosis X Familiarity occurred in terms of social distance preferences. The study is considered within the context of the 'signaling event-attribution-affect-action' model of Corrigan (1998, 2000, 2004). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Somatic symptoms have been conceptualized in many different ways in literature. Current classifications mainly focus on the numbers of symptoms, with relative neglect of the underlying psychopathology. Researchers have emphasized the importance of a number of experiential, perceptual and cognitive-behavioural aspects of somatization. This review focuses on existing literature on the role of somatosensory amplification, attribution styles, and illness behaviour in somatization. Evidence suggests that somatosensory amplification is neither sensitive nor specific to somatizing states, and that other factors like anxiety, depression, neuroticism, alexithymia may also have an influence. Attribution research supports the existence of multiple causal attributions, which are related to the numbers of somatic symptoms. While somatizing patients have more organic attributions, depressed patients have more psychological attributions. A global somatic attribution style is associated with the number of obscure somatic symptoms, while a psychological attribution style is associated with both--psychological and somatic--symptoms of depression and anxiety. There are conflicting findings with respect to the role of normalizing attributions in reducing physician recognition of anxiety and depression. Specific symptom attributions appear to explain physician recognition of psychological distress, but global attribution styles do not appear to explain any further variance in physician recognition beyond that explained by specific causal attributions. Illness behaviour has been studied in two distinct ways in literature. Research focusing on attendance rates as a form of illness behaviour suggests that somatization is associated with high levels of health care utilization. There is also some evidence that health care utilization, amplification and attributions styles may be interrelated among somatizing patients. More structured ways to assess illness behaviour have found high levels of abnormal illness behaviour in this population. Overall, research appears to suggest a complex (and as yet unclear) relationship between somatic symptoms and underlying cognitions/illness behaviours. While it is clear that somatization is closely related to a number of perceptual and cognitive-behavioural factors, the precise nature of these relationships are yet to be elucidated.

Abstract = {In his seminal work The Varieties of religious experience William James devoted two chapters to 'the sick soul' - the interrelation between psychopathology and religion. His main emphasis was on three aspects: a) Melancholia (pessimism, hopelessness and anhedonia) -b)Anxiety and insecurity - c) Morbid doubt and querulous melancholia. In his descriptive approach, William James looked beyond psychopathology at individual attempts to understand the inexplicable in their mental distress. Diagnostic systems have changed over the last hundred years, but his categories still have their validity although they should include psychosis which can present in religious delusions. Anthropology has taught us to distinguish between disease and the subjective experience of illness. Mental suffering can become so distressing that the afflicted person experiences it as foreign and externally oppressed. Depending on a person's cultural and religious background the causes can be seen in a religious context or even in personalized spiritual forces. The author introduces the term 'spiritualization of psychopathology'. Such spiritualized causal attributions are frequent in delusional disorders. However, they are also found in anxiety and mood disorders, as well as in personality disorders accompanied by behavior and drives which are not acceptable to the individual. Thus, the discrepancy between a person's ideal and subjective experience is interpreted in a spiritual or religious terminology. Religious interpretations of causality can be understood in the framework of cultural sensitivity, which is underlined in new formulations of the DSM-IV. Often patients do not hold rigid convictions of the spiritual causes of their illness. Rather they are developing very subjective interpretations which exist side by side with other medical or psychodynamic models of explanation. Discrepancies in the causal attributions can lead to tensions between therapist and patient. Assessment of religious attributions and their functions should lead to a 'shared construction of meaning' resulting in better support and coping.

Abstract = {Aims: Several studies have found an inverse relationship between people's readiness to endorse biogenetic causal explanations of mental disorder and their desire for social distance from people with mental disorders. The aim of this study is to examine why this may be the case. Method: In the spring of 2001, a population survey was carried out among German citizens aged 18 years and older, living in private households. A total of 5025 interviews were conducted, reflecting a response rate of 65.1%. At the beginning of the personal, fully structured interview, respondents were presented with a vignette containing a diagnostically unlabelled psychiatric case history, either depicting a case of schizophrenia or major depressive disorder. Using five-point Likert scales, causal attributions as well as perceived dangerousness, fear and the desire for social distance were assessed. Results: The more respondents endorse a brain disease as a cause, the more dangerous they believe the person with schizophrenia or major depression to be. Respondents who perceive the individual in the vignette as being dangerous express a higher degree of fear and a greater preference for social distance from these individuals. As compared with brain disease, the relationships between heredity and perceived dangerousness are less pronounced for both disorders. Conclusions: Our analysis showed that endorsing biogenetic explanations decreases the likelihood of social acceptance of people with schizophrenia and major depression. Rejecting behavioural responses in the form of social distance desired from people with schizophrenia and major depression result from cognitive emotional processes in which biogenetic causal attributions are linked to lack of self-control, unpredictability and dangerousness, which, in turn, are associated with fear of these people.

Abstract = {Evidence suggests that care staff have difficulty recognizing offending behaviour in adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) and that they are reluctant to report such behaviour to the police. Whilst there has been speculation as to why there may be such reluctance, there are no empirical studies. In this study, questionnaires using vignettes of fictitious crimes were completed by 80 care staff in residential homes and 65 police officers. The fictitious perpetrators in the vignettes were described either as non-disabled or as having ID. Care staff and police ratings of causal attributions and affect were compared, and the effect of perpetrator status (with or without ID) was also examined. The findings confirmed that care staff are still reluctant to report incidents by people with ID to the police. Carer and police views were generally in accord concerning perpetrators without ID but there were significant differences between groups rating perpetrators with ID. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTH)},

Abstract = {Is practitioner interest in prescriptive authority an indicator of our increased adoption of a biological approach to mental health treatment? This exploratory survey examined the relationship between practitioners' causal attributions for a subset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (text revision; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) diagnoses and attitudes toward prescribing. Although practitioners favoring prescriptive privileges did show a trend toward biological conceptualizations, the predominant result of the survey suggested that practitioners continue to strongly support the utility of psychotherapy. Further, most practitioners indicated that a biopsychosocial approach was most informative in guiding actual practice. Implications of these results for our identity as psychologists and for clinical decision making are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objectives: This article addresses the clinical implications of 3 questions: (1) Can a simple checklist, suitable for use by practitioners, assess all components of explanatory models (EMs) for mental distress? (2) Are perceived causes of mental distress actually related to treatment preferences? (3) Are EMs influenced uniquely by ethnic group, or are they more closely associated with the presence of common mental disorders? Method: From February 2003 to January 2004, we investigated EMs for mental distress among 79 Bangladeshi, 85 black Caribbean, and 97 white British people who reported difficulties in the preceding month. EMs were assessed by a self-report checklist that inquired about the identity, causes, timeline, consequences, controllability, and preferred treatments for mental distress. Common mental disorders were assessed using the Clinical Interview Schedule (revised). Results: Independent of ethnic group, people with common mental disorders were more likely to give spiritual causal explanations (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.9 to 4.9), to report behavioral (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.8) and financial consequences (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.8 to 6), and to prefer complementary treatments (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 2.3 to 9.1). Compared with black Caribbean and white British subjects, Bangladeshi subjects more often gave spiritual or physical causal explanations. Compared with white British subjects, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean subjects preferred medical and spiritual treatments, whereas white British subjects, as compared with the other 2 ethnic groups, preferred self-management and social treatments. Causal explanations did not always relate to the corresponding treatment preferences. Conclusions: EMs can be assessed by a simple checklist, show variations by ethnic group, and are associated with common mental disorders. Identifying EMs may strengthen the assessment of common mental disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined the degree to which lay beliefs about the causes of disorders may predict beliefs about what constitutes appropriate treatment. Methods: We analyzed randomized vignette data from the MacArthur Mental Health Module of the 1996 General Social Survey (n = 1010). Results: Beliefs in biological causes (i.e., chemical imbalance, genes) were significantly associated with the endorsement of professional, biologically focused treatments (e.g., prescription medication, psychiatrists, and mental hospital admissions). Belief that the way a person was raised was the cause of a condition was the only nonbiologically based causal belief associated with any treatment recommendations (talking to a clergy member). Conclusions: Lay beliefs about the biological versus nonbiological causes of mental and substance abuse disorders are related to beliefs regarding appropriate treatment. We suggest areas for further research with regard to better understanding this relationship in an effort to construct effective messages promoting treatment for mental health and substance abuse disorders.

Abstract = {Objective: Many anti-stigma programmes use the 'mental illness is an illness like any other' approach. This review evaluates the effectiveness of this approach in relation to schizophrenia. Method: The academic literature was searched, via PsycINFO and MEDLINE, to identify peer-reviewed studies addressing whether public espousal of a biogenetic paradigm has increased over time, and whether biogenetic causal beliefs and diagnostic labelling are associated with less negative attitudes. Results: The public, internationally, continues to prefer psychosocial to biogenetic explanations and treatments for schizophrenia. Biogenetic causal theories and diagnostic labelling as 'illness', are both positively related to perceptions of dangerousness and unpredictability, and to fear and desire for social distance. Conclusion: An evidence-based approach to reducing discrimination would seek a range of alternatives to the 'mental illness is an illness like any other' approach, based on enhanced understanding, from multi-disciplinary research, of the causes of prejudice.

Abstract = {This article summarizes the rationale, development and application of the McGill Illness Narrative Interview (MINI), a theoretically driven, semistructured, qualitative interview protocol designed to elicit illness narratives in health research. The MINI is sequentially structured with three main sections that obtain: (1) A basic temporal narrative of symptom and illness experience, organized in terms of the contiguity of events; (2) salient prototypes related to current health problems, based on previous experience of the interviewee, family members or friends, and mass media or other popular representations; and (3) any explanatory models, including labels, causal attributions, expectations for treatment, course and outcome. Supplementary sections of the MINI explore help seeking and pathways to care, treatment experience, adherence and impact of the illness on identity, self-perception and relationships with others. Narratives produced by the MINI can be used with a wide variety of interpretive strategies drawn from medical anthropology, sociology and discursive psychology.

Abstract = {Objective: Stigma has dampening effects on the overall rehabilitation of individuals given a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This study was an initial attempt to understand the relationship between cognitive insight and attribution in the development of self-stigma among this group of mental health consumers. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, the investigators interviewed 162 mental health consumers with broad diagnoses of schizophrenia from 15 community-based psychiatric rehabilitation centers in Hong Kong. After controlling for the effects of demographic and illness-related factors, the authors used hierarchical multiple regression analysis to investigate the effects of cognitive insight and causal attribution on self-stigma. Results: Better cognitive insight and attribution of personal responsibility to the cause of the illness were significantly associated with higher levels of self-stigma. Conclusions: Given that awareness and interpretation of participants' illness were related to self-stigma, cognitive restructuring is needed to alleviate self-stigma among individuals with schizophrenia.

Abstract = {The first part of the chapter is devoted to biblical themes in different forms of psychopathology: depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety and personality disorders. The second part briefly reviews the theme of religious attribution of causes of mental illness. Pfeifer discusses his own research on the subject in which it was demonstrated that demonic causal attributions were not specifically related to psychosis (schizophrenia) but to the ego-dystonic quality of certain perception, feelings, and actions. Pfeifer uses the term ego-dystonic in its classical sense of the quality of unfamiliarity and strangeness; what happens in one's perception, feeling, or action does not belong to oneself and is, in cases of demonic attribution, explained by the influence of demons. The third part of his chapter argues for the need to build bridges between biblical 'models' and bio-psycho-social psychiatry. Biblical models of mental distress are more complicated and rich than is suggested by concepts like sin, curse, and demonic possession. Biblical texts do support an integrative view on the patient in which biological, psychological, and sociological aspects are interwoven. In the final paragraph Pfeifer offers a plea for a supportive, integrative and value-sensitive approach to the patient. Therapy should focus on helping the patient to get a multivariate view of their conflicts and their suffering within the framework of personal faith, thus achieving a constructive reintegration of faith into the whole range of experience and coping with the existential reality of life.

Abstract = {In this article, the authors present findings from a qualitative study exploring how people diagnosed with depression conceptualize their condition and how their conceptualization shaped their efforts to seek help. They used an interview guide based on an explanatory model framework for data collection. Four major themes emerged from the analysis: (a) somatization, social meaning of illness, and help seeking; (b) meaning and perceived consequences of illness; (c) How did I get here? Making sense of psychiatric admission; and (d) variations in the causal attribution and the role of significant others in help seeking. Somatization of emotional problems, variations in causal attribution between patients and their significant others, the nature of the available health care system, and burden of infectious disease complicate access to care. These findings suggest the need to raise the awareness of primary care providers on how to recognize and help people with depression appropriately in this setting.

Abstract = {Past research has shown that Asians underutilize mental health services. One way to increase the use of such services is to understand their causal beliefs and help-seeking behaviors. The aim of this study was to examine how causal attributions of three types of psychiatric symptoms (depressive, anxious, and schizophrenic) were associated with preferred sources of help among a group of university students in Singapore. Cross-sectional data were collected through a survey questionnaire with symptom vignettes and examined by path analyses. Main results showed that endorsements of causal attributions varied by symptoms; for example, depressive and anxious symptoms were more likely than schizophrenic symptoms to be attributed to psychosocial causation. Based on separate path analyses for every symptom type, both psychosocial and biomedical causations were correlated with each other, which in turn were associated with various sources of help. Psychosocial causation was associated with the source of friend/classmate whereas biomedical causation was associated with the sources of medical doctor, mental health professional, and alternative medical practitioner. Seeking helps from these professional sources were also correlated with each other. These findings suggest that causal attributions, particularly biomedical dimensions of psychiatric symptoms, should be highlighted when implementing relevant mental health services for university students; and they may be receptive to a holistic treatment team consisting of friends, medical doctors, mental health professionals, and alternative medical practitioners.

Abstract = {This dissertation examined the role of personal ideology in distinguishing between individuals who are likely to possess a negative stance toward victims of sexual assault and those who are not. An individual's stance toward victims was conceived of as negative attitudes as well as a tendency to hold victims of sexual violence responsible for their assaults. Current thinking with regard to attribution formation proposes a multi-step model that captures the overarching process by which causal attributions are formed (Weiner, 1990), but this model does not account for the individual differences that may moderate movement between those steps. The growing body of research that examines victim-blaming tendencies has identified several variables associated with increased victim-blame, highlighting the role of individual differences in the mechanisms by which causal attributions are formed. These variables include sex, sex-role orientation, political orientation, religious conservatism and worldview. This dissertation proposed that personal ideology, a variable found to be associated with value-laden dimensions of personality such as religiosity, political orientation and worldview, will also be associated with individual differences in stance toward victims of sexual assault. The role of sex and sex-role orientation was also examined. This dissertation employed a two-step design that made use of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Measured used to operationalize individuals' stance toward victims include the Perceived Causes of Rape Scale (Cowan & Quinton, 1997) and the Attitudes toward Rape Victims Scale (Ward, 1988). Personal ideology was operationalized using Stone and Schaffner's (1988) Modified Polarity Scale, and sex-role orientation was assessed using the Women's Rights and Roles Questionnaire (Coppolillo, 2003). Results of analysis via 2x2 ANOVA demonstrated that those high in the normative dimension of personal ideology tend to be more blaming of victims of sexual assault and also hold more negative attitudes toward victims than do those who are less normatively-oriented. Qualitative analysis of small group discussions on the causes of sexual assault mirrored this finding. Implications for outreach and education efforts to prevent sexual assault and improve response to victims are discussed. Coppolillo, C. M. (2003).

Abstract = {Objectives: This study examined child welfare and mental health professionals' views of the quality of psychiatric services received by consumers of the child welfare system and explored root causes of perceived quality problems. Methods: One hundred and thirty child welfare, mental health and court professionals participated in qualitative interviews individually or in groups. Data analyses identified perceived problems in quality and perceived causes of quality problems. Participants in member checking groups were then asked to comment on and further clarify the results. Results: The participants reported concerns related to overuse of psychotropic medication, overmedicated children, short inpatient stays, and continuity of psychiatric care. Overuse of psychotropic medications and overmedication were perceived to be driven by short evaluations, liability concerns, short inpatient stays and a lack of clinical feedback to psychiatrists from child welfare partners. Medicaid reimbursement policies were at the heart of several quality concerns. These problems contributed to a distrust of psychiatric practices among child welfare professionals. Conclusions: These findings underscore the adverse effects of modern marketplace medicine coupled with low Medicaid reimbursement rates on quality of care for vulnerable groups. Child welfare and mental health professionals and their associated stakeholders may together possess substantial clout to advocate for a reimbursement system and structure that promotes quality service. The findings also point to a crisis of credibility toward psychiatric practice among social service and other non-psychiatrist mental health professionals. Efforts are needed to increase the capacity for psychiatrists and child welfare professionals to communicate effectively with each other and for psychiatrists to receive the information that they need from their child welfare partners to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

Abstract = {Background and aims: It has been recognized that Asian immigrants in North America have lower rates of mental health service utilization. From the perspective of cross-cultural psychiatry, one of the most important cultural factors may be differences in the explanatory model of illness. This article examines the relationship of causal beliefs, perceived service accessibility and attitudes towards seeking mental health care. Method: The sample consisted of 1000 immigrant and refugee women from five ethnic minority communities in Toronto, including three Chinese Canadian communities (Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan), Korean Canadians and Vietnamese Canadians. Data were acquired by a self-administered structured questionnaire. Quantitative data were analysed using MANOVA, ANOVA and stepwise multiple regression. Results: The five ethnic minority groups of women differed in their explanatory models about mental illness and distress. In the full model where other variables were controlled for, the most significant factor predicting attitudes towards seeking professional help was perceived access for all groups except the Hong Kong Chinese. In the last group, those subscribing more to a Western stress model of illness had a more positive attitude towards seeking professional help, while those subscribing more to supernatural beliefs had a more negative attitude. Age and education were not significant predictors. Conclusion: Perceived access is one of the main factors that influence attitudes toward seeking professional help. Explanatory models may predict help-seeking behaviours if perceived access to such services is available. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {There is a large population of Turkish-speaking migrants living in London, many of whom are refugees (Enneli,Modood, & Bradley, 2005). Primary care and secondary mental health services have consistently reported poor continuity of care among patients from this community. The aim of this study was to explore the possible interconnection of causal attributions and pathways into care among Turkish-speaking, mainly Kurdish, patients with a past history of psychosis. Narratives of illness were elicited from informants. Physical symptomatology was a prominent feature of presentation in this group. These patients did not discuss their health problems conceptualized as uniform 'models' of illness, but rather in an attributional style that emphasized the experience of traumatic life events, often related to the overarching problem of exile and settlement. Childhood and family issues of poverty and domestic violence were often raised by patients, but tended to be backgrounded as having little contributory significance. These patients sought intervention, serially or in combination, from a diverse range of practitioners, including private healthcare and traditional healers or hocas. Their explanatory models of illness were complex and fragmentary and the relationship between explanations and help seeking is seldom linear. The implications of these findings for health services are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: People hold a wide variety of beliefs concerning the causes of illness. Such beliefs vary across cultures and, among immigrants, may be influenced by many factors, including level of acculturation, gender, level of education, and experience of illness and treatment. This study examines illness causal beliefs in Turkish-immigrants in Australia. Methods: Causal beliefs about somatic and mental illness were examined in a sample of 444 members of the Turkish population of Melbourne. The socio-demographic characteristics of the sample were broadly similar to those of the Melbourne Turkish community. Five issues were examined: the structure of causal beliefs; the relative frequency of natural, supernatural and metaphysical beliefs; ascription of somatic, mental, or both somatic and mental conditions to the various causes; the correlations of belief types with socio-demographic, modernizing and acculturation variables; and the relationship between causal beliefs and current illness. Results: Principal components analysis revealed two broad factors, accounting for 58 percent of the variation in scores on illness belief scales, distinctly interpretable as natural and supernatural beliefs. Second, beliefs in natural causes were more frequent than beliefs in supernatural causes. Third, some causal beliefs were commonly linked to both somatic and mental conditions while others were regarded as more specific to either somatic or mental disorders. Last, there was a range of correlations between endorsement of belief types and factors defining heterogeneity within the community, including with demographic factors, indicators of modernizing and acculturative processes, and the current presence of illness. Conclusion: Results supported the classification of causal beliefs proposed by Murdock, Wilson & Frederick, with a division into natural and supernatural causes. While belief in natural causes is more common, belief in supernatural causes persists despite modernizing and acculturative influences. Different types of causal beliefs are held in relation to somatic or mental illness, and a variety of apparently logically incompatible beliefs may be concurrently held. Illness causal beliefs are dynamic and are related to demographic, modernizing, and acculturative factors, and to the current presence of illness. Any assumption of uniformity of illness causal beliefs within a community, even one that is relatively culturally homogeneous, is likely to be misleading. A better understanding of the diversity, and determinants, of illness causal beliefs can be of value in improving our understanding of illness experience, the clinical process, and in developing more effective health services and population health strategies.

Abstract = {Background: The global burden of mental illness is high and opportunities for promoting mental health are neglected in most parts of the world. Many people affected by mental illness live in developing countries, where treatment and care options are limited. In this context, primary health care (PHC) programs can indirectly promote mental health by addressing its determinants i.e. by enhancing social unity, minimising discrimination and generating income opportunities. The objectives of this study were to: 1. Describe concepts of mental health and beliefs about determinants of mental health and illness among women involved with a PHC project in rural Maharashtra, India; 2. Identify perceived mental health problems in this community, specifically depression, suicide and violence, their perceived causes, and existing and potential community strategies to respond to them and; 3. Investigate the impact of the PHC program on individual and community factors associated with mental health; Method: We undertook qualitative in-depth interviews with 32 women associated with the PHC project regarding: their concepts of mental health and its determinants; suicide, depression and violence; and the perceived impact of the PHC project on the determinants of mental health. The interviews were taped, transcribed, translated and thematically analysed.; Results: Mental health and illness were understood by these women to be the product of cultural and socio-economic factors. Mental health was commonly conceptualised as an absence of stress and the commonest stressors were conflict with husbands and mother-in-laws, domestic violence and poverty. Links between empowerment of women through income generation and education, reduction of discrimination based on caste and sex, and promotion of individual and community mental health were recognised. However, mental health problems such as suicide and violence were well-described by participants.; Conclusion: While it is essential that affordable, accessible, appropriate treatments and systems of referral and care are available for people with mental illness in developing country settings, the promotion of mental health by addressing its determinants is another potential strategy for reducing the burden of mental illness for individuals and communities in these settings.},

Abstract = {This study investigated illness concepts of schizophrenic patients in an Arab-Islamic and a western European cultural background. 24 Jordanian and 23 German inpatients were interviewed using an illness concept scale and a causal belief questionnaire. Jordanian patients tend to believe more in esoteric factors underlying their illness, and they perceive the illness to be more threatening. There were no differences regarding biological explanations of illness and trust in medication; however, Jordanian patients reported more trust in the treating physician. Nearly all patients mentioned psychosocial stress as an important factor underlying their illness. Concerning treatment, only Jordanian patients believed religion to be an important factor and mentioned distance from the family as beneficial. The study highlights that culturally specific factors influence illness concepts of schizophrenic patients from an Arab-Islamic and a western European cultural background. Knowledge of these illness concepts is important to establish a helpful relationship between physician and patient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Unlike educated adults, young children demonstrate a “promiscuous” tendency to explain objects and phenomena by reference to functions, endorsing what are called teleological explanations. This tendency becomes more selective as children acquire increasingly coherent beliefs about causal mechanisms, but it is unknown whether a widespread preference for teleology is ever truly outgrown. The study reported here investigated this question by examining explanatory judgments in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), whose dementia affects the rich causal beliefs adults typically consult in evaluating explanations. The results indicate that unlike healthy adults, AD patients systematically and promiscuously prefer teleological explanations, suggesting that an underlying tendency to construe the world in terms of functions persists throughout life. This finding has broad relevance not only to understanding conceptual impairments in AD, but also to theories of development, learning, and conc)},

Abstract = {Background: We aim to elicit how far the public has incorporated Freudian theory in its understanding of mental illness in different countries, focussing on the unconscious conflict as a possible cause of mental disorders.; Sampling and Methods: We conducted representative population surveys with identical sampling procedures and face-to-face interviews in Germany (1990, n = 3,078; 2001, n = 5,025), Novosibirsk (Russia, 2002, n = 745), and Bratislava (Slovakia, 2003, n = 1,000) and a representative telephone survey in Germany in 2006.; Results: Two thirds of respondents in Germany endorsed an unconscious conflict as a cause of mental disorder. Endorsement was stronger for depression than for schizophrenia, increased with duration of schooling, and was less prevalent in Bratislava and Novosibirsk and in East compared to West Germany. Endorsement in Germany increased between 1990 and 2001. However, only 5% of respondents could offer a definition of unconscious conflict that resembled Freud's initial theory.; Discussion: The observed West-East gradient is likely to mirror the past political undesirability of psychoanalysis in former communist countries. The popularity of psychoanalytical concepts seems to lag behind their actually declining influence within psychiatry in Germany. Public conception of unconscious conflict however hardly resembles Freud's original ideas.; Conclusions: Although psychoanalytical concepts warrant consideration when exploring patients' causal beliefs about mental illness, psychiatrists should focus on the subjective meaning of seemingly psychoanalytic phrases.},

Abstract = {The authors report how the population identifies symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) and the causes attributed to this disorder in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 500 household residents aged 18 years and above were examined in a cross-sectional design, in São Paulo. Instruments were a case vignette depicting AD and a structured questionnaire. The symptoms of AD were identified by 46.4% as memory loss. The term AD was used in only 4% of the responses, although 39.4% of the respondents believed it was a mental illness. The main causes attributed were of psychosocial in nature: 'drug use' and 'isolation.' Factors most influencing responses about causes were marital status, level of education, and economic status. In summary, medical-scientific concepts are not usually used in São Paulo. Causal attributions show that the laypersons' beliefs have important differences from the results of scientific evidence.

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between causal beliefs about psychosis and marital instability and help-seeking preferences of 326 Nigerian immigrants who completed a 153-item survey. Results showed differential endorsement of intrapersonal, interpersonal, personal-circumstantial, and supernatural causal beliefs, with greater acceptance of the first two dimensions for psychosis and marital instability, respectively. The higher the Nigerian immigrants' educational levels, the less they accepted supernatural causation. Endorsing supernatural causation of psychosis, as well as personal-circumstantial causation of marital instability, was positively related to preference for informal help-seeking. Length of stay in the US was not related to preference for formal help-seeking for psychosis, or informal help-seeking for marital instability. However, it was positively related to preference for formal help-seeking for marital instability; and negatively related to preference for informal help-seeking for psychosis. Findings suggest that causal beliefs may affect help-seeking preferences. Culturally-sensitive guidelines for treating mental illness and marital instability are proposed.

Abstract = {The following paper presents two separate investigations of the influence of knowledge and categorization in reasoning. Chapter 1 begins with an outline of relevant background ideas in categorization research and evidence of how knowledge influences categorization decisions. From here, Chapter 2 presents the first set of experiments. These experiments test how the acquiring of knowledge and formation of beliefs can influence the categorization of causal events. Experiment 1 of Chapter 2 presents participants with ambiguously defined causal events and tests how a causal belief can be used to categorize these ambiguous items. Experiment 2 explores how the strength of the belief that is acquired affects the categorization process. The influence of the categorization of ambiguous causal events on overall causal strength beliefs is tested in Experiment 3. Experiment 4 takes the idea of categorizing ambiguous causal events to a new arena and looks at how ambiguous temporal events are categorized. Chapter 3 presents a new experimental paradigm and looks at how previously acquired background knowledge affects reasoning about categories. Mental health clinicians who have great experience in dealing with mental disorder categories were tested to determine how this experience affects their memory for mental disorder categories. Clinicians' memory performance was compared to less experienced participant groups in order to determine how memory develops over the acquiring of experience and background knowledge. The implications of this research are discussed in the end of Chapter 3. After this discussion, the ideas that have been presented in this manuscript are summarized in Chapter 4. This final chapter also highlights implications for the research programs outlined in this document in real world reasoning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Perceptions of stress are related to psychopathology among adults with mild intellectual disability (ID). Adults with mild ID perceive stressful social interactions as occurring more frequently and as having a greater impact than other types of negative life events. Adults with mild ID also report a lower rate of adaptive coping to deal with stressful social interactions than for other categories of stressors. Stressful social interactions, the causal attributions for them, and coping may be salient features of depression in adults with mild ID. In Chapter 1, the stressful social interactions, category of others with whom these interactions occur, specific interpersonal components of social interactions perceived as stressful, and coping strategies of 114 adults with mild ID were assessed. Stressful social interactions involving other people with ID occurred most frequently and had the highest stress impact. Controlling aggression, being involved and sociable, and self-assertion were the most stressful components of social interactions. Adults with mild ID reported using Problem-Focused coping more frequently than Emotion-Focused or Support Seeking coping. Active coping was negatively related to psychological distress. In Chapter 2, the stressful social interactions, casual attributions, and coping strategies of 62 adults with mild ID with and without depression were evaluated. Depressed adults with mild ID reported a higher frequency and stress impact of stressful social interactions, exhibited a more negative attribution style, and utilized fewer active and more avoidant coping strategies than non-depressed adults. Findings have implications for theory building and development of interventions to increase the psychological wellbeing of adults with mild ID.

Abstract = {Objective: A small number of patients tend to use a disproportionately high amount of mental health services. Understanding the needs and behaviours of this group is important in order to improve patient management. Few studies have investigated the role that patients' perceptions about their mental illness play in guiding coping responses and treatment seeking. The aim of the present study was to investigate how illness perceptions in high users of mental health services were related to unmet needs and treatment-seeking behaviours. Method: A total of 203 high users of mental health services were interviewed using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, the Camberwell Assessment of Need and the Drug Attitude Inventory, and were also asked to report the number of visits they had made to the general practitioner in the past year. District Health Board clinical staff completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need and the Global Assessment of Functioning for each user. Results: More negative perceptions about mental illness were associated with higher ratings of unmet needs by both patients and staff. Negative perceptions were also related to poorer attitudes towards medication, and lower functioning. Perceptions about the personal ability to control the illness were consistently associated with better outcomes. Patients' causal attributions could be categorized as social, psychological, biological and behavioural. More frequent visits to the general practitioner were associated with perceptions of more severe symptoms, greater concern and higher emotional responses to the illness, and psychosocial causal attributions. Conclusion: Illness perceptions provide a framework to assess patients' ideas about severe mental illness and a means by which to identify maladaptive beliefs. Interventions targeted at changing these beliefs may encourage better self-management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Patients' PTSD symptoms at 6 and 12 months were assessed. Criticism and hostility in relatives were associated with attributing problems to factors controllable by patients. Relatives with marked emotional over-involvement (EOI) had an attributional profile similar to low EE relatives. Deficits in normal behaviour ('negative symptoms') were perceived as more controllable, internal and stable than were more obvious signs of an illness or mental health problem such as hypervigilance and intrusive thoughts and nightmares ('positive symptoms'). Irritability or anger was perceived as more controllable and personal than any other problem. Hostility was associated with less psychological understanding. EE (hostility) but not attributions was found to predict clinical outcome. The results are consistent with previous studies of relatives of schizophrenia patients. The study suggests a need for interventions, which focus on helping relatives to reappraise the impact of PTSD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Obtaining valid information about the opinions of relatives on the causes and social consequences of mental disorders should be an important component in specifically tailoring therapeutic interventions for relatives according to their needs. The available range of instruments is small, however, the most prominent being the Italian Questionnaire on the Opinions of the Family (QOF), developed specifically for schizophrenic disorders. The German validation study of this instrument sought to determine whether the subscale structure of the QOF can be replicated in a group of relatives (N=161) of patients with schizophrenic disorders as well as recurrent depressive and bipolar disorders. Results demonstrate that the original QOF subscales cannot be transferred to groups of relatives of patients with affective disorders, nor to a German group of relatives of patients with only schizophrenic disorders. Therefore, a German version of the QOF was created. Using this modified version of the instrument, researchers established a three-factor solution differentiating the opinions of relatives on chronic mental disorders into three components, reflecting orientation towards pathology, towards normality and towards optimising resources for treatment. None of these factors showed significant relationships with the relatives' causal attributions about mental disorders. Further research is needed to establish cross-nationally valid versions of such instruments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Retrospective perceptions and causal beliefs regarding the temporal patterning of precompetitive psychological responses were examined in 12 elite rugby union players. Composite sequence analysis resulted in a series of temporal networks to describe participants’ cognitive, affective, and behavioural responses in a time-to-event paradigm. Match-related cognitions remained stable in the lead up to competition, while perceptions of physical symptoms peaked at the onset of performance. Affective responses were associated with feelings of anxiety and tension in the early temporal phases but excitement, confidence, and efficacy in team-mates directly before competition. Behavioural themes described activities associated with technical and physical preparation, familiarization with environmental conditions, and strategies to control activation states early on or directly before competition. The findings highlight the idiosyncratic and dynamic nature of the temporal patterning of precompetitive responses and the influence that perceptions of the team have upon individual preparation for performance. Implications are discussed in the context of the type and timing of intervention for developing individual and team preparatory routines.

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined the degree to which lay beliefs about the causes of disorders may predict beliefs about what constitutes appropriate treatment. Methods: We analyzed randomized vignette data from the MacArthur Mental Health Module of the 1996 General Social Survey (n =1010). Results: Beliefs in biological causes (i.e., chemical imbalance, genes) were significantly associated with the endorsement of professional, biologically focused treatments (e.g., prescription medication, psychiatrists, and mental hospital admissions). Belief that the way a person was raised was the cause of a condition was the only nonbiologically based causal belief associated with any treatment recommendations (talking to a clergy member). Conclusions: Lay beliefs about the biological versus nonbiological causes of mental and substance abuse disorders are related to beliefs regarding appropriate treatment. We suggest areas for further research with regard to better understanding this relationship in an effort to construct effective messages promoting treatment for mental health and substance abuse disorders.

Abstract = {Objective: This study examined hypotheses that stigmatizing attitudes are increased by use of psychiatric labels, by conceptualization of symptoms as a medical illness and by belief in genetic causes. Method: A survey of 3998 Australian adults asked questions about one of four vignettes: early schizophrenia, chronic schizophrenia, depression and depression with suicidal thoughts. Attitudes were measured by a social distance scale and a question about likely dangerousness. Results: Social distance was unrelated to the hypothesized factors. For schizophrenia (but not depression), belief in dangerousness was predicted by medical illness conceptualizations and genetic causal attribution. However, more important factors were the behaviours in the vignette and the belief that they are because of weakness of character. Conclusion: Biomedical conceptualizations are not the major cause of stigma, rather it is the behaviour associated with mental illness and the belief that this is because of personal weakness.

Abstract = {Objective: Little is known about public conceptions of mental disorders in Latin America and the Caribbean. The aim of this article is to assess how the population identifies symptoms of schizophrenia and the causes attributed to this disorder in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Method: A household survey was carried out in 2002 with a probabilistic sample of 500 individuals, residents of São Paulo with ages ranging from 18 to 65. Vignette describing in colloquial language an individual with schizophrenia (according to DSM-IV and ICD-10) was presented together with a structured questionnaire with questions about the vignette. Results: The symptoms of schizophrenia were identified by 23.4% as depression. The term schizophrenia was used in only 2.2% of the responses. A bit more than half of the respondents believed it was a mental illness. The main causes attributed were 'drug use' and 'isolation'. Factors most influencing responses about causes were years of schooling and identification as a mental illness. Conclusions: Medical-scientific concepts are used less in São Paulo than in other countries. The main causes attributed by the public relate to psychosocial stress. Causes of biological or moral nature are considered less relevant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Recognizing the complementary effects of social contexts and psychiatric disorders, this study clarifies the role of gender in suicidal behavior in urban Mumbai by considering psychiatric diagnoses and patient-identified sociocultural features. The cultural epidemiological approach suggests the critical impact of situational sociocultural factors that complement the customary psychopathological accounts for those who harm or kill themselves. The cultural epidemiology of deliberate self-harm (DSH), it is argued, is critical to planning for suicide prevention, community mental health and psychiatric practice. This study, based on a cultural epidemiological framework, compares male and female admissions for DSH, evaluating conditions with SCID-I and EMIC interviews. We assessed features and narratives of suicidal behavior, patient-identified underlying problems, their perceived causes and triggers. The study included 92 women and 104 men. A diagnosis of depressive disorder was made for 48.9 percent of women and 39.4 percent of men. Many patients (50.0 percent of women and 41.3 percent of men) did not fulfill the criteria for any diagnosis, or did so only for an adjustment disorder or a V-code. Men typically explained DSH with reference to work problems, financial problems and problem drinking. Women typically discussed domestic problems, in law relations and victimization. Problem drinking affected women living with men who drank. Social and situational factors appear to play a relatively greater role than psychiatric illness in self-harm and suicide in Mumbai, as in other Asian studies, compared with Europe and North America.

Abstract = {Background: For people who self-harm, there is growing evidence to suggest that services and treatment outcomes can be adversely affected by healthcare staffs’ stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors. To date, the empirical literature has tended to focus on the attitudes of experienced healthcare professionals working with adults who self-harm. Additionally, there has been few theory or model-driven studies to help identify what healthcare students think and feel about young people who self-harm. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to explore the way healthcare and non-healthcare students think and feel about adolescent self-harm behavior using Corrigan et al.’s [Corrigan, P.W., Markowitz, F.E., Watson, A., Rowan, D., Kubiak, M.A., 2003. An attribution model of public discrimination towards people with mental illness. Journal of Health and Social Behavior 44, 162–179] attribution model of public discrimination towards people with mental illness. Design: The study was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional, survey that consisted of two hypothetical vignettes. Settings: Two universities in England, United Kingdom. Participants: One hundred and eighty-four final-year students, covering health (medicine, nursing, clinical psychology) and non-health care (physics) professions. Methods: Students were presented with vignettes describing a young female who self-harms. Attributions of controllability were experimentally manipulated across the vignette conditions and students were asked to complete self-report questionnaires measuring attitudes towards self-harm, familiarity with self-harm and social desirability. Results: Consistent with the public discrimination model, students who believed that a young person was responsible for their self-harm reported higher feelings of anger towards them. Anger, in turn, was associated with a belief in the manipulatory nature of the self-harm and with less willingness to help. Perceived risk was found to be associated with higher levels of anxiety and increased support for the use of coercive and segregatory strategies to manage self-harming behavior. Gender and student type were important influences on public stigma, with both men and medical students reporting more negative attitudes towards self-harm. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a number of factors may adversely affect the care and treatment received by young people who self-harm, namely: students’ causal attributions, the gender and profession of healthcare students, and familiarity with self-harm behavior. To improve the effectiveness of service provision and treatment outcomes for people who self-harm, it is important that health care service providers and teaching institutions consider the implications of these factors when developing staff and services, and base interventions on theoretical models of stigma and discrimination.

Abstract = {Background: Health demographic mortality studies use verbal autopsies to identify suicide as a cause of death. Psychological autopsies focus almost exclusively on associated high-risk psychiatric disorders. New approaches considering contextual factors are needed for preventing suicide and promoting mental health. Aims: This study examined explanations of suicide reported by surviving family members or close friends with reference to social, cultural, and environmental conditions as well as the challenges of life in the Malavani slum of Mumbai. Methods: An EMIC (Explanatory Model Interview Catalog) interview based on a cultural epidemiological framework considered underlying problems, perceived causes, and sociocultural contexts. It was administered to survivors of 76 people who had died by suicide (56.6% women). Results: Accounts of underlying problems typically referred to various aspects of tension (73.7%). Perceived causes often identified multiple factors. The sociocultural contexts of suicide included the victimization of women, the personal and social impact of problem drinking, marital problems, physical health problems, mental tension, possession and sorcery. Women were particularly vulnerable to the impact of problem drinking by a spouse or father. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the value of an approach to sociocultural autopsy examining local contexts and explanations of suicide. Findings highlight needs for both mental health services and culturally sensitive social interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The focus of the research study is to explore chronically ill African American, Latino, and White patients' causal attributions of symptoms of depression and factors that predict depression care treatment preferences among these groups. Research has demonstrated that perception of illness impacts what treatments a person will deem appropriate for their mental health problems and from whom they will seek treatment. Research also indicates that certain ethnic groups are more likely to seek treatment for their symptoms of depression in the primary care setting. Yet, it is unclear how they actually perceive their symptoms and what best predicts the treatments that they are likely to consider acceptable. A convenient sample of 109 HIV+ adults, 79 diabetic adults, and 3 adults with both conditions were recruited for this study. Participants had to be receiving services for either HIV, diabetes, or both conditions in one of the three central Austin facilities and be a representative from one of three racial/ethnic groups: African Americans, Latino, and White. Differences were found across ethnicity with regard to causal beliefs and treatment preferences for the symptoms of depression both among the HIV and the diabetic subgroups. Latinos in both groups were more likely than Whites to prefer counseling or a single form of treatment over combined treatment methods. Diabetic Latinos were more likely to prefer counseling for symptoms of depression. HIV seropositive individuals who reported the least number of symptoms of physical illness were more likely to attribute their symptoms of depression to stressful life events, whereas those who reported the greatest number of symptoms of physical illness were more likely to attribute their symptoms of depression to their medical illness. Additionally among the HIV subgroup, individuals who reported high stress tended to predict the preferences for treatment provided by a psychiatrist/psychologist and Whites scored highest on this factor. Finally, differences in depression scores across race/ethnicity were also revealed. The utility of assessing a patient's understanding of symptoms of depression in order to determine how personal illness models impact treatment preferences and knowledge of patient's causal attributions can aid medical social workers and physicians in collaborative management of chronic illness and depression are discussed.

Abstract = {Mental disorders are a major public health concern, and knowing how people think about their causes and treatments can help ensure the success of public education efforts. In the current studies, I examine beliefs about the biological and psychological causes of mental disorders and how they relate to beliefs about the effectiveness of medication and therapy at treating different disorders. In Study 1, I found a systematic preference for within-domain cures among undergraduates: the more a mental disorder is regarded as biologically caused, the more effective medication is thought to be at treating it, with the opposing trend for psychotherapy. The opposite pattern of treatment preferences was found for disorders thought be psychologically caused. In Study 2, I examined beliefs about how treatments affect the mind and brain, and find that undergraduates and adults believe therapy actually has more effect on the mind than the brain, and medication has more effect on the brain than the mind. This systematic pattern suggests that people might be swayed by dualist forms of reasoning, in which they think of biological and psychological phenomena as largely separate and causally distinct domains. Consistent with this idea, in Study 3, I found that people are willing to agree that the symptoms of more psychologically-caused disorders are less a reflection of brain-functioning than more biologically-caused disorders. In Study 4, I examined clinicians' causal beliefs about disorders and found that though they acknowledge all disorders are caused by both biological and psychological factors, the relative importance of each type of cause varies across disorders. Finally, in Study 5, I found that similar to undergraduates, clinicians believe that cases of a mental disorder caused by biological factors are thought more treatable by medication than cases of the same disorder caused by psychological causes. I discuss whether such beliefs about treatment are normative, their possible impact on adherence to prescribed treatments, and the implications of causal beliefs for attitudes, blame, and sympathy for those suffering from mental disorders.

Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate, using serotonin transporter genotyping as an example, the preparedness of individuals from an urban general population identified with hypothetical genetic risk for a depressive disorder to moderate risk through cognitive or behavioural intervention. It also evaluated endorsement of genetic and environmental causal attributions of mental illness. Method: A qualitative approach using focus group methodology was selected as most appropriate because these issues are relatively unexplored. Participants (n=36) aged ≥18 years from metropolitan Sydney discussed their understanding of the role of genetic and environmental risk factors in mental illness and attitudes towards pre-symptomatic interventions based on genetic risk information. Results: Thirty-six participants attended four focus groups involving 8-10 participants per group. Participants predominantly viewed genetic risk factors for depression as predisposing rather than causal, with environmental risk factors acting as triggers. Hypothetical identification with a genetic variant suggesting predisposition to depression prompted strong interest in seeking further information about predictive genetic testing from medical professionals, willingness to reduce life stress, drugs and alcohol intake, willingness to increase exercise, and willingness to undertake cognitive and behavioural interventions at a pre-symptomatic stage. Mixed views prevailed as to whether stress was a modifiable risk factor. Preventive intervention at a presymptomatic stage of depression was viewed negatively in a minority of participants due to a fatalistic attitude towards a genetic predisposition and attitudes that intervention was futile in the absence of symptoms. Conclusions: There is a likely public demand for preventive mental health interventions for healthy people on the basis of genetic susceptibility if predictive genetic testing becomes available in psychiatry. The findings have implications for general practitioner and public education about predictive genetic testing for susceptibility to common multifactorial disorders for at-risk groups.

Abstract = {The current experiments examine mental health clinicians' beliefs about biological, psychological, and environmental bases of the DSM-IV-TR mental disorders and the consequences of those causal beliefs for judging treatment effectiveness. Study 1 found a large negative correlation between clinicians' beliefs about biological bases and environmental/psychological bases, suggesting that clinicians conceptualize mental disorders along a single continuum spanning from highly biological disorders (e.g., autistic disorder) to highly nonbiological disorders (e.g., adjustment disorders). Study 2 replicated this finding by having clinicians list what they thought were the specific causes of nine familiar mental disorders and rate their bio-psycho-environmental bases. Study 3 further found that clinicians believe medication to be more effective for biologically based mental disorders and psychotherapy to be more effective for psychosocially based mental disorders. These results demonstrate that even expert mental health clinicians make strong distinctions between psychological and biological phenomena.},

Abstract = {Genetics and mental health professionals increasingly provide education and counseling related to risk for psychiatric illness, but there is insufficient evidence about patient perceptions and needs to guide such interventions. Affected individuals and relatives may perceive increased family risk and have interest in genetic education and counseling. Our objectives were to explore perceptions of family vulnerability, perceived control, and coping strategies related to familial risk and needs from genetic counseling. Our methods included conducting semi-structured interviews (n = 48) with individuals with bipolar disorder (BPD) and unaffected siblings. Content analysis generated descriptive data that provide guidance for clinical interventions and themes to evaluate in future studies. The results showed that participants perceived increased personal and family risk, attributing BPD to genes and family environment. Causal attributions were often uncertain and at times inconsistent. Participants wished to modify psychiatric risk to relatives, but were uncertain how to do so; despite the uncertainty, most parents reported risk-modification efforts. Efforts to cope with family vulnerability included monitoring and cognitive distancing. Participants endorsed the usefulness of education and psychological support, but described more ambivalence about receiving risk assessment. Educational and supportive interventions around family risk for BPD should focus on perceptions of cause and vulnerability, reproductive decision-making, and early intervention and risk modification in young relatives. Psychological support is an important component. Providers should evaluate patient coping strategies, which could facilitate or hinder genetic counseling interventions, and should not assume interest in quantitative risk assessment.

Abstract = {Background: the increased incidence of psychosis in African-Caribbeans in the UK compared to the white British population has been frequently reported. The cause for this is unclear; social factors are said to account for this increase and one factor that is often cited is discrimination. Aims and method: we have looked at two groups of psychotic patients, blacks of Caribbean origin and white British, and present a qualitative comparison of the individual’s experience of unfair treatment and its perceived cause. Results: the African-Caribbean patients did not describe more perceived discrimination than their white counterparts but were more likely to claim that their distress was due to racial discrimination perpetrated by the psychiatric services and society in general. The white patients were more likely to attribute perceived discrimination to their mental illness. Conclusion: this mismatch of explanatory models between black patients and their doctors may account for some inequalities in their treatment, their relative non-engagement and adverse outcome.

Abstract = {The current experiments examine mental health clinicians’ beliefs about biological, psychological, and environmental bases of the DSM-IV-TR mental disorders and the consequences of those causal beliefs for judging treatment effectiveness. Study 1 found a large negative correlation between clinicians’ beliefs about biological bases and environmental ⁄ psychological bases, suggesting that clinicians conceptualize mental disorders along a single continuum spanning from highly biological disorders (e.g., autistic disorder) to highly nonbiological disorders (e.g., adjustment disorders). Study 2 replicated this finding by having clinicians list what they thought were the specific causes of nine familiar mental disorders and rate their bio–psycho–environmental bases. Study 3 further found that clinicians believe medication to be more effective for biologically based mental disorders and psychotherapy to be more effective for psychosocially based mental disorders. These results demonstrate that even expert mental health clinicians make strong distinctions between psychological and biological phenomena.

Abstract = {Background: There is growing evidence that mental health literacy has improved in western countries in recent years. The question arises as to whether this trend is paralleled by an improvement of attitudes towards people with mental illness. Aim: To examine the development of mental health literacy and the desire for social distance towards people with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder in Eastern Germany over a time period of eight years. Method: A trend analysis was carried out using data from two population surveys conducted in the eastern part of Germany in 1993 and 2001. By means of a fully structured interview psychiatric labelling, causal beliefs, help-seeking and treatment recommendations as well as the desire for social distance was assessed. Results: While there was an increase in the mental health literacy of the public, the desire for social distance from people with major depression and schizophrenia remained unchanged or even increased. Conclusions: The assumption underlying a number of anti-stigma campaigns, namely that educating people about mental disorders may automatically lead to the improvement of their attitudes towards the mentally ill, appears questionable.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by A. Jorm and K. Griffiths (see record [rid]2008-13148-006[/rid]). The authors' efforts to avoid concluding that some of their data clearly confirm what they set out to question rests on the argument that 'Biomedical conceptualizations are not the major causes of stigma; rather it is the behavior associated with mental illness and the belief that this is because of personal weakness'. They claim to have found that the behaviors in the vignette and a belief in personal weakness as a cause are both 'more important' factors than illness conceptualizations or genetic causal beliefs. In fact, their study provides no evidence to support either of these claims. While waiting for the actual evidence about illness beliefs to overcome ideology we do all seem able to agree on the importance of increasing contact with the 'out-group', directly or via films, etc., when trying to reduce fear and prejudice.

In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors external locus of control beliefs and psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced higher levels of trauma and loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391). The conflicting findings across studies are interpreted with respect to probable differences in contingencies of reinforcement for causal attributions in professionals and in novices in disaster management.

The author of this book is a polymath, with doctorates in both the physical sciences and in psychology, an ex-patient with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, leading to a serious suicide attempt, a Pantheist, and for many years an academic in the area of the brain/ behavioral sciences. In structure, the book has three parts: The first part introduces the general approach, emphasizing that we should take more seriously first person accounts of major mental illness. The second part consists of autobiographical sections, with biographies of a number of persons he has met in practice as a community-based psychologist. The final part are reflections on what has gone before, including an interesting chapter on the interactions between CBT, psychoanalysis, existential therapy, spirituality and 'sense of self' in therapy. There are some areas where I hold back my assent, for instance, on occasion, where the author makes causal attributions. Trainee psychiatrists will regularly meet people with perspectives as diverse as those described herein. As a way into the inner world of such people, I believe this book to be of greater educational value than much standard description found in psychopathology or psychiatry textbooks.

Abstract = {The London bombings on 7 July 2005 highlighted the prevailing terrorist threat to the UK. The present study addressed the psychological response of a community (n=294) indirectly exposed to the attacks to discern the broader impact and effects of terrorism. Qualitative content analysis was used to develop a profile of emotions and responses to the attacks. This was supplemented by the use of linguistic analysis demonstrating the enormous heterogeneity and complexity of responses to terrorism. In light of previous work on the wider impact of terrorism, the present study highlighted a relatively restrained impact of terrorism. Notwithstanding this observation, responses were marked by negative emotions, with increased use of references to others than for self. Responses also highlighted the use of psychological distancing more among white than Asian respondents, and the importance of religion, both as a supportive factor and perceived cause of the attacks, with references more prevalent among Asian respondents. Although the ubiquitous nature of negative emotions also slightly heightened reports of perceived risk, the ability of respondents to use methods of social orientation helped their ability to recover, and may be crucial in helping harness unified community-based responses to terrorism.

Abstract = {Objective: Children’s causal attributions about childhood mental health problems were examined in a national sample for prevalence; relative stigmatization; variation by age, race and ethnicity, and gender; and self-report of a diagnosis of depression or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: A national sample of 1,091 children were randomly assigned to read vignettes about a peer with depression, ADHD, or asthma and respond to an online survey. Causal attributions and social distance were assessed, and correlations were examined. Logistic regression models for each causal item tested main effects and interaction terms for conditions, demographic characteristics, and self-reported diagnosis. Results: The beliefs that parenting, substance abuse, and low effort caused the condition were all strongly intercorrelated and were moderately correlated with social distance. The depression condition was the strongest predictor of endorsement of the most stigmatizing causal beliefs. Stigmatizing causal beliefs were evident for ADHD, but with more modest effects. Children who reported a diagnosis were more likely to endorse parenting and substance abuse as causes (attenuated for ADHD). Modest to moderate effects were found for variation in causal beliefs across ethnic groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a consistent presence of stigmatization in children’s beliefs about the causes of childhood mental health problems. Low effort, parenting, and substance abuse together tapped a moralistic and blaming view of mental health problems. The results reinforce the need to address stigmatization of mental disorders and the relative stigmatization of different causal beliefs. The findings of variation by ethnicity and diagnosis can inform and target antistigmatization efforts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of the perceived cause of stuttering on perceptions of persons who stutter (PWS) using a 7-item social distance scale, a 25-item adjective pair scale and a 2-item visual analogue scale. Two hundred and four university students rated vignettes which varied on describing a PWS with different causalities for stuttering (psychological, genetic, or unknown). Ratings differed significantly according to assigned causality. The vignette with the stuttering due to psychological causes was rated more negatively on 14 adjective pairs and the Social Distance Scale Index when compared to the ratings of vignettes with stuttering caused by either genetic or unknown causes. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between ratings of the vignettes attributing stuttering to either genetic or unknown causes. Neither familiarity with PWS nor the perceived curability of stuttering had any significant association to the ratings. Implications of findings regarding negative stereotypes, stigmatization and perceived causality for PWS are discussed. Educational objectives: Readers will be able to describe and explain: (1) research regarding negative stereotypes and stigma associated with stuttering, (2) research about attribution theory and stigma, (3) two methods used to evaluate stereotypes and stigma in adults, and (4) the negative effects on ratings of PWS due to psychological causality.

Abstract = {This paper aims to show how training in psychology leads students (at the beginning and the end of their studies) to consider that psychological disorders result from dispositional factors specific to the patients, particularly in therapeutic failure (fundamental attribution error and hindsight bias). Faced with a clinical case of a somatic disease with psychological repercussions, for which the effect of the initial treatment remains unclear, the students must choose: the repetition of treatment, the recovery or indecision. They must also define the elements that could have contributed to the evolution of the disease using causal attribution scales (C.D.S.II). At least half of the Master's students choose indecision. When they choose to continue the treatment, they more often consider that the patient's condition is partially linked to his dispositions and to determinants controllable by himself L1's students choose to continue the treatment and are empathetic with the patient. For them, the evolution of his condition is linked to the situation and he cannot control it. In the case of therapeutic failure, training in psychology achieves at best to lead Master's students to choose indecision but it fails partly to lead them to contend with hindsight bias and fundamental error.

Results show that distress, ambivalence, psychosocial causation, and biomedical causation were positively correlated with each other; distress was inversely associated with preference for seeking help from a family doctor; ambivalence was inversely associated with preference for a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) physician; physiological causation was positively associated with preference for a medical doctor and TCM physician; and psychosocial causation was positively associated with preference for a mental health professional.

Abstract = {Background: Given that accessing care, treatment engagement, and course and outcomes among people with schizophrenia may be influenced by beliefs about causes in the larger community, causal beliefs about schizophrenia have been studied in numerous communities around the world. In particular, the 30-item list of etiological attributions developed by Angermeyer and colleagues has been used to describe causal beliefs in patients, family members, and lay community members within such communities. The current study, the first examination of the latent or factorial structure of these 30 causal beliefs, seeks to provide informative subscales that may enhance reliability and validity of groupings of causes for future analyses involving community members. Method: Data were gathered from six separate surveys involving three distinct groups of individuals from the same community within the southeastern United States: lay community members, relatives of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and police officers at the start of a 1-week mental health training program. Results: Exploratory factor analysis in the overall sample (n = 577) revealed four factors that were used to define four subscales, termed: personal/family/social stressors (14 items), inconsistent with modern conceptions of risk (8 items), external/environmental insults to the brain (6 items), and consistent with modern biological conceptions (2 items). Cronbach’s internal consistency reliability coefficients for these subscales were 0.91, 0.83, 0.71, and 0.65, respectively. Conclusions: These findings suggest that subscales could be derived to provide continuous measures for assessing causal beliefs in order to study how this concept relates to attitudes toward schizophrenia, the people affected by the disorder, and treatments that are recommended by mental health professionals. Replication within similar and dissimilar groups is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 498 non-clinical subjects, teachers in a local school system. Instruments used included the self-administered General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) to measure psychiatric morbidity; the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) to measure depressive symptoms; documentation of regular use of psychotropic medication; and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125) for personality traits self-assessment. Results: The proportion of subjects presenting psychiatric morbidity (GHQ-28 > 6) or depressive symptoms (CES-D > 20) was significantly higher among explosive, passive–aggressive, and obsessional temperament profiles, and among schizotypal, moody, melancholic and dependent character profiles. Similar results were observed with the scores on each of the four GHQ-28 subscales (depression, anxiety, social dysfunction, and somatic symptoms). The regular use of psychotropic medications was significantly higher among the passive–aggressive and explosive temperament types, and among the schizoptypal and moody character types. Limitations: Being a cross-sectional study, no causal attributions can be inferred. Subjects on sick leave were excluded, so the sample was not representative of the general population. The data were collected using self-reporting questionnaires, and no specific psychiatric diagnoses were obtained. Conclusions: It is possible to identify certain personality configurations associated with minor psychopathology and concomitant use of psychotropics, among active professional people.

Abstract = {Several studies show depression is common during pregnancy. However, there is limited information in Tanzania on the magnitude of perceived distress during pregnancy and meanings ascribed to such distress. A descriptive survey collected data using unstructured interviews from 12 traditional practitioners and 10 peri-urban women with previous pregnancy related mental health concerns identified using a depression vignette. The objectives were to describe the sources and characteristics of distress during pregnancy, and idioms of distress that could inform cultural adaptation of depression screening tools. Narrative analysis showed an emergent category of "problematic pregnancies" framed women's recollections of prolonged periods of sadness. This experience was qualified using various idioms of distress that were differentially emphasized depending on informant's perceived causes of health concern. The idiom kusononeka was consistently used to describe extreme sadness across causal categories and clustered with at least two typical features of major depression. This suggested existence of a construct with similarities to biomedical criteria for depression. "Thinking too much" emerged as a distinctive expression associated with prolonged sadness. Distinctive expressions of social functioning impairments were identified that can inform depression severity assessments. In conclusion, contextual inquiry into experiences of psychological distress showed distinct local idioms that clustered in patterns similar to symptoms of biomedical depressive episodes. Further studies to assess the utility of local idioms of distress and distress related functional impairment in depression assessment tools are warranted.},

Abstract = {From a review of the literature about the emergence of various categories indicating the work «harms», such as attrition, stress, violence and harassment, we try to identify both the remanences in the form of exploration of the issue «health and work» and the ignorance which seems to go along with it. The new «psychosocial risk» category is part of this legacy. It reproduces and partly renews the stakes which are linked to these socio-historical constructions. Indeed the link between health and work is always grasped through its negative and deleterious effects. Thus, it denies the important issues of the health of the «unemployed» as well as work as a source of health. The «games» around causal attribution are still alive between the supporters of the «risk exposure» and those of the proneness to illness of the «fragile» people. As the issues about health appear to be individualized and eugenics trends seem to be growing, it leads to a sort of «omerta» about the question linked to work and health because of the fear of the stigma. Such a silence may be a counterproductive form of resistance as it contribuets to the fatigue and loneliness of each one in front of the unavoidable experience of fragility which is not a personal one but a human one.

Abstract = {Attention and behavior problems occur at high rates among Latino children in the United States; however, Latino children are less likely than children from other racial/ethnic groups to receive treatment for these problems. Efforts to understand and address these disparities should include research to understand how Latino parents perceive and respond to child behaviors within an ecological framework, as broad contextual factors are known to influence parenting and help-seeking. To this end, the present study utilized grounded theory methodology to analyze in-depth interviews conducted with a community sample of 25 ethnically-diverse Latino mothers of varying levels of socioeconomic status (SES). The primary aims for the study were: (1) To examine parental understanding and perceptions of DSM-IV ADHD and ODD symptoms; (2) To explore and describe self-reported parenting and help-seeking responses to clinical levels of child ADHD and ODD behaviors, as depicted in hypothetical behavioral vignettes; and (3) To explore general childrearing values and socialization goals among Latino mothers. Each of these aims were examined from an ecological perspective by considering demographic and psychosocial factors, including SES, level of acculturation, and maternal levels of depression and social support. Four major findings emerged. First, Latino mothers did not experience significant difficulty understanding DSM-IV symptoms of ADHD or ODD and the way they perceive these behaviors is largely consistent with the respective clinical disorders. Second, parental responses to clinical levels of ADHD and ODD behaviors were linked to external versus internal causal attributions across both disorders. Third, parental socialization goals, which reflected strong values on educational/professional goal attainment and positive interpersonal skills, were associated with reported parental responses to ADHD and ODD, respectively. Finally, there were trend differences in results by level of SES. The theoretical model that emerged from this study extends existing models related to parental beliefs, parenting, and help-seeking behavior. Findings suggest important clinical implications with respect to assessing ADHD and ODD among Latino children and engaging Latino parents into parenting and school-based interventions. Results of this study will inform future research and intervention-development efforts ultimately aimed at increasing mental health service use and improving outcomes among Latino children.

Abstract = {Although recent medical advances have increased our understanding of mental illness, people with mental illness continue to experience stigma. Only a few studies have addressed mental illness stigma in Africa, and they tend to be non-representative. Using a population-based sample of 1,550 adults from the Stigma in Global Context-Mental Health Study, this study applies the Etiology and Effects of Stigma Model to frame and evaluate mental illness stigma in South Africa. Analyses investigate causal attributes, stigma, and the links between them, taking into account how demographics structure both. Findings show that causal attributions are complex and that mental illness stigma exists in South Africa with schizophrenia drawing more stigma than depression. South Africans are hesitant to engage people with mental illness in marital relations and childcare. For the most part, social-demographic characteristics of persons described with mental illness are not associated with stigma. However, Blacks stand out as recipients of negative White responses. Gender is only significant when interacted with selected causal attributions. For example, males who endorse normal ups and down as cause of illness are more intolerant than females. Biogenetic causes are associated with intolerance, while non-biogenetic attributes reveal tolerant attitudes. Further, Black, male, and lowly educated respondents are more likely to endorse non-biogenetic causes for mental illness. In sum, the South African context is not unique; however, unlike other past studies, race and ethnicity matter. This is not surprising given South Africa’s history of apartheid and its vestiges that have structured interaction and development of the nation’s diverse racial groups. Corresponding to the Etiology and Effects of Stigma Model, causal attributions and selected socio-demographic characteristics influence mental illness stigma in South Africa. The respondents’ race has direct influence while gender is indirectly related to stigma. Internal attributions lead to increased stigma while externalized causes are associated with more tolerance. This study extends stigma work to non-western contexts and advances our general knowledge of disease stigma in Africa. Therefore, it informs anti-stigma efforts in South Africa and contributes to the ongoing debate on the association between knowledge of mental illness labels, attributions, and stigma.

Abstract = {Ethnic minority youth use mental health services less frequently than Caucasian youth, despite similar rates of psychopathology. Research has documented ethnic differences in (1) parents’ beliefs about the seriousness, prognosis, and etiology of child symptoms and (2) preferences for help-seeking, which may partially explain disparities in treatment utilization; however, few studies have examined underlying cultural factors that may account for ethnic differences or parent’s beliefs and preferences with regard to youth anxiety. This study examined parents’ beliefs about separation anxiety disorder (SAD) and preferences for help-seeking among 117 Indian-American (IA; n = 39), Puerto Rican (PR; n = 39), and European-American (EA; n = 39) mothers. After reading four vignettes describing SAD symptoms, parents rated the seriousness, prognosis, and etiology of symptoms and the likelihood of help-seeking. Parents also completed measures of acculturation, independent/interdependent self-construal, and strength of religious faith. RM-MANCOVA (controlling for SES) revealed that PR mothers were more likely than EA mothers to endorse medical etiology and were more likely than IA mothers to seek help from a physician. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that acculturation and strength of religious faith predicted parents’ etiological beliefs and preferences for help-seeking, after accounting for variance associated with SES and child gender. Results highlight the importance of examining cultural constructs that may contribute to ethnic differences. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

Abstract = {Background: Explanatory models (EMs) refer to patients’ causal attributions of illness and have been shown to affect treatment preference and outcome. Reliable and valid assessment of EMs may be hindered by interviewer and respondent disparities on certain demographic characteristics, such as ethnicity. The present study examined (a) whether ethnic minority patients reported different EMs to ethnically similar interviewers in comparison with those with a different ethnicity, and (b) whether this effect was related to respondents’ social desirability, the perceived rapport with the interviewer and level of uncertainty toward their EMs. Methods: A total of 55 patients of Turkish and Moroccan origins with mood and anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to ethnically similar or dissimilar interviewers. EMs were assessed, using a semi-structured interview, across 11 different categories of causes. Results: Participants who were interviewed by an ethnically similar interviewer perceived interpersonal, victimization and religious/mystical causes as more important, whereas interviews by ethnically dissimilar interviewers generated higher scores on medical causes. These effects were not mediated by the perceived rapport with the interviewer, and social desirability had a modest impact on the results. Higher uncertainty among participants toward medical and religious/mystical causes seemed to be associated with greater adjustment in the report of these EMs. Conclusion: The findings have significant implications for interviewer selection in epidemiological research and clinical practice.

Abstract = {The current study examined the criticism component of expressed emotion (EE) and attributions in parents of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (S/SA) or high functioning autism/Asperger’s. Consistent with study hypotheses, parents of adults diagnosed with autism/Asperger’s disorder exhibited lower levels of high EE-criticism than parents of adults diagnosed with S/SA. Moderate trends suggested that parents of adults diagnosed with autism/Asperger’s disorder tended to make less blameworthy attributions towards patients than did parents of adults diagnosed with S/SA. A content analysis of parents’ causal attributions was also conducted. The most common cause cited by both groups of parents was biological factors, suggesting that parents may be becoming more aware of scientific findings implicating biological factors, in conjunction with psychosocial factors, as a major cause of mental illness.

Abstract = {Aim: This research aimed to assess the contribution of the five core areas of the transactional stress model to the relatives’ psychological distress (PD) when informally taking care of patients with functional psychoses treated in community mental health care. Subjects and methods: Cross-sectional data from 163 relatives were collected in interviews, while data on 158 patients were collected by analyzing clinical charts. The following areas were assessed: socio-demographic and illness-related features of the patients, socio-demographic features of the relatives (environmental variables); sense of coherence, mastery, causal attributions and opinions of relatives about mental disorders (person variables); interpersonal problems with the patients as well as the assessment of their symptoms by the relatives themselves (primary appraisal); support received, critical life events and burden of relatives caused by their own illnesses (secondary appraisal); control behavior and efforts of relatives to engage the patients in activities (coping). PD was assessed with the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire. Bi-variate correlation analysis and a multiple linear regression model were the main test statistical approaches. Results: Correlation analysis showed that differences between diagnostic groups referred to primary and secondary appraisal processes, in particular. Results of the statistical model provided evidence for the importance of primary appraisal and person variables for influencing PD, and for the lack of importance of coping and environmental variables. Conclusion: The study enhanced the validity of the transactional stress model to demonstrate the influence of salutogenetic concepts such as sense of coherence.

Abstract = {Objective: Stigma is a frequently cited barrier to help-seeking for many with substance-related conditions. Common ways of describing individuals with such problems may perpetuate or diminish stigmatizing attitudes yet little research exists to inform this debate. We sought to determine whether referring to an individual as 'a substance abuser' vs. 'having a substance use disorder' evokes different judgments about behavioral self-regulation, social threat, and treatment vs. punishment. Method: A randomized, between-subjects, cross-sectional design was utilized. Participants were asked to read a vignette containing one of the two terms and to rate their agreement with a number of related statements. Clinicians (N= 516) attending two mental health conferences (63% female, 81% white, M age 51; 65% doctoral-level) completed the study (71% response rate). A Likert-scaled questionnaire with three subscales ['perpetrator-punishment' (α = .80); 'social threat' (α = .86); 'victim-treatment' (α = .64)] assessed the perceived causes of the problem, whether the character was a social threat, able to regulate substance use, and should receive therapeutic vs. punitive action. Results: No differences were detected between groups on the social threat or victim-treatment subscales. However, a difference was detected on the perpetrator-punishment scale. Compared to those in the 'substance use disorder' condition, those in the 'substance abuser' condition agreed more with the notion that the character was personally culpable and that punitive measures should be taken. Conclusions: Even among highly trained mental health professionals, exposure to these two commonly used terms evokes systematically different judgments. The commonly used 'substance abuser' term may perpetuate stigmatizing attitudes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In two studies, 190 Nicaraguan immigrants were interviewed about (a) their experiences of discrimination in Costa Rica, (b) their affective reactions toward discrimination, and (c) their representations about the causes of the discriminatory events. Study 1 (N = 192, 50% women) shows that the reactions towards discrimination form two basic dimensions, i.e., depression and anger. These dimensions correlated differentially with markers of mental health, specifically personal and collective self-esteem. Study 2 (N = 88, 51% women) replicates this bidimensional structure and shows that causal attribution of discrimination moderates the relationship between discrimination, depression and anger. Specifically, experiences of discrimination were found to be associated with depression when causal attribution of discrimination were the attitudes of the other (i.e. Costa Ricans' prejudice), however when causal explanation of the discrimination rested in the membership to the discriminated group (being Nicaraguan), experiences of discrimination were found to be related with anger.

Abstract = {Research suggests that attributing mental illness to moral causes and perceiving it as dangerous relates to greater stigma, whereas belief in biomedical factors is associated with less. Within the family-centric Orthodox Jewish community, mental illness is perceived as a risk to family functioning and future generations, and is therefore stigmatizing of the individual and their family. Since biomedical models may exacerbate these concerns, we hypothesized that unlike within the general population, biological causal attributions would relate to increased stigma among Orthodox Jews. Consequently, we also examined the attitudinal correlates of stigmatization of obsessive-compulsive disorder within the Orthodox community, as measured by both social distance and family/marriage concerns. Results indicated that, unlike previous research, biological models were associated with greater marriage/family stigma, and did not predict less social distance. This suggests that biomedical approaches may increase salient aspects of stigma within the Orthodox community, and clinical practice should be sensitive to these concerns.

Abstract = {Whereas some research suggests that acknowledgment of the role of biogenetic factors in mental illness could reduce mental illness stigma by diminishing perceived responsibility, other research has cautioned that emphasizing biogenetic aspects of mental illness could produce the impression that mental illness is a stable, intrinsic aspect of a person ('genetic essentialism'), increasing the desire for social distance. We assessed genetic and neurobiological causal attributions about mental illness among 85 people with serious mental illness and 50 members of the public. The perceived responsibility of persons with mental illness for their condition, as well as fear and social distance, was assessed by self-report. Automatic associations between Mental Illness and Guilt and between Self and Guilt were measured by the Brief Implicit Association Test. Among the general public, endorsement of biogenetic models was associated with not only less perceived responsibility, but also greater social distance. Among people with mental illness, endorsement of genetic models had only negative correlates: greater explicit fear and stronger implicit self–guilt associations. Genetic models may have unexpected negative consequences for implicit self-concept and explicit attitudes of people with serious mental illness. An exclusive focus on genetic models may therefore be problematic for clinical practice and anti-stigma initiatives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Context: Most environmental risk factors for psychiatric disorders cannot be studied experimentally, making causal attributions difficult. Can we address this question by using together 2 major methods for causal inference: natural experiments and specialized statistical methods? Objective: To determine the causal relationship between dependent stressful life events (dSLEs) and prior depressive episodes (PDEs) and major depression (MD). Design: Assessment of risk factors and episodes of MD at interview. Statistical analyses used the co-twin control and propensity score–matching methods. Setting: General community. Participants: Four thousand nine hundred ten male and female twins from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. Main Outcome Measure: Episodes of MD. Results: We found that dSLEs were strongly associated with risk for MD in female (odds ratio [OR], 5.85) and male (4.55) twins in the entire sample and, at considerably lower levels, in female (2.29) and male (2.19) monozygotic twins discordant for dSLE exposure. A case-control sample matched on propensity score showed a moderate association in female (OR, 1.79) and male (1.53) twins. A PDE strongly predicted risk for MD in female (OR, 3.68) and male (5.20) twins in the entire sample. In monozygotic pairs discordant for exposure, the association was weaker in male (OR, 1.41) and absent in female (1.00) twins. A case-control sample matched on propensity score showed a moderate association between PDE and depressive episodes in male (OR, 1.58) and female twins (1.66). Conclusions: Although dSLEs have a modest causal effect on the risk for MD, a large proportion of the observed association is noncausal. The same pattern is seen for PDEs, although the causal impact is somewhat more tenuous. For environmental exposures in psychiatry that cannot be studied experimentally, co-twin control and propensity scoring methods—which have complementary strengths and weaknesses—can provide similar results, suggesting their joint use can help with the critical question of causal inference.

Abstract = {The present article offers an overview discussion of ethnocultural aspects of PTSD, with special attention to major conceptual issues, clinical considerations, and therapy practices. The historical circumstances leading to the widespread acceptance of PTSD among conventional mental health professionals, and the subsequent criticisms that emerged from scholars, humanitarian workers, and ethnocultural minorities are presented as an important background to the current controversial status of the concept, especially with regard to arguments regarding the ethnocultural determinants of PTSD. The concept of culture, its definition, and its developmental socialization process, are presented as foundations for understanding the many influences cultural variables have on the perception, experience, clinical expressions, and treatment responses to trauma. A 'trauma event-person ecology' model identifies the different factors that serve to shape the outcome of trauma within and across cultures. A therapy outcome equation is presented that summarizes the complex calculus of variables and considerations impacting different outcomes. The many healing principles used by different Western and traditional approaches are also identified, calling attention to the importance of fitting patient to therapist to therapy to present and past circumstances. The article concludes that in spite of what appears to be common neurological processes, correlates, and consequences in the initial response to trauma exposure, ethnocultural variables exercise major influence on perceived causes, symptom manifestations, clinical parameters (i.e., onset, course, and outcome), interventions, and societal responses.

Abstract = {The public’s causal attributions of schizophrenia have far-reaching effects on the community and affected individuals. This study investigated causal beliefs within a community of predominantly Protestant, low-income, urban, African Americans in the southeastern United States. Two hundred eighty-two patrons of an inner-city food court/farmers’ market participated in a self-administered survey assessing causal beliefs through a 30-item survey and self-reported causal opinions. Associations were assessed between causal attributions of schizophrenia and sociodemographic characteristics and exposure/familiarity variables. Certain sociodemographic variables, as well as key exposure/familiarity variables, predicted the nature of one’s causal beliefs. The most common causal opinions reported included substance abuse, negative life events, and 'mental illness.' Findings from a subsample administered an exploratory multiple-choice question investigating understanding of causation revealed that the public may not fully understand the nature of causation. Although this study suggests potential determinants of causal beliefs held by community members, further research examining the public’s conception of causation would enhance interpretation of studies on such beliefs.

Abstract = {The use of the term 'psychosocial interventions' in the title implies that short stature (SS) carries with it a burden predisposing the person to problems of psychological adjustment. Because of the visible salience of SS and its potential to serve as a lightning rod for false causal attributions, there is a need to differentiate assumptions and stereotypes from evidence. This brief overview examines the evidence regarding stature-related experiences and the psychosocial adaptations of children and adolescents with SS. These observations are discussed in the context of common developmental experiences, such as 'teasing,' and the prevalence of behavioral or emotional disturbance in the general population. Guidance is provided for the psychosocial evaluation of children and adolescents with SS who show psychological adjustment difficulties, and recommendations for evidence-based mental health treatments tailored to the presenting problem are offered.

Abstract = {Background/Aim: To investigate recognition, attitudes and causal beliefs regarding dementia in Italian, Greek and Chinese Australians in comparison with 3rd generation Australians. Little is known about dementia literacy in these racial and ethnic minority groups. Methods: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted of 350 Italian, 414 Greek, 437 Chinese and 500 3rd generation Australians randomly selected from the telephone directory. Results: Third generation participants (85%) were more likely to recognize dementia symptoms in a vignette in comparison to Italian (61%), Greek (58%) and Chinese (72%) participants. Overall, the racial and ethnic minority groups had more negative attitudes about persons with dementia. The racial and ethnic minority groups were more likely to suggest old age and psychosocial risk factors caused dementia, whereas 3rd generation Australians were more likely to suggest brain disease. Differences between ethnic minority and 3rd generation groups remained after controlling for sociodemographic variables. There were differences between Italian, Greek and Chinese participants on markers of acculturation associated with knowledge and beliefs within each group. Conclusions: Racial and ethnic minority groups have poor dementia literacy in comparison to 3rd generation Australians. There is a need for dementia education targeted to and tailored for these groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The present study attempts to elucidate the role of attributions in the coping trajectories of abused African American women. The study investigates the relationships between abused women’s causal attributions for violence, coping strategies, and PTSD outcomes. Approximately 793 women were approached outside of either a battered women’s shelter or the District Court, resulting in the recruitment of 406 primarily low-income, ethnic minority abused women. Only data from the 324 women who completed the baseline and identified themselves as African American were used in this study. Women’s causal attributions related to intentionality (intentional versus incidental violence) were regressed on six categories of coping strategies (placating, resistance, formal help source, informal help source, safety planning, and legal strategies) and on three clusters of PTSD symptoms (intrusion, avoidance, and arousal). Finally, regressions were conducted to determine how women’s coping strategies were related to their PTSD outcomes. It was found that Intentional attributions predicted significant distress associated with all three clusters of PTSD symptoms while Incidental attributions did not significantly predict distress related to any of the PTSD clusters. Passive coping strategies, namely, placating and informal help source coping strategies, also predicted distress related to PTSD. Attributions did not significantly predict abused women’s coping strategies. The author concludes that how abused women interpret and react to the violence they experience plays a substantial role in their mental health outcomes. Findings show the clinical relevance of women’s coping trajectories for understanding IPV. The manuscript also discusses how women’s ethnic minority status and cultural beliefs affect women’s interpretation and reaction to violence.

Abstract = {Two hundred sixty-four South Indians from Kerala, India completed questionnaires assessing factors influencing mental illness labeling, negative stereotyping, and social distancing based on case descriptions of mental illness. Case vignettes depicted symptoms of major depression and schizophrenia (Kumar & Nevid, 2010). Results revealed that case vignettes of schizophrenia elicited greater levels of endorsement of mental illness labeling, perceived weakness, and stereotyping as violent to others in comparison to case vignettes of depression. Responses to female case vignettes were associated with lower levels of social distance and stereotyping as violent to self than responses to male case vignettes. Our findings indicated that stereotyping as weak mediated the relationship between labeling and social distance. Greater endorsement of spiritual causal attributions of mental illness and traditional gender role beliefs elicited lesser endorsement of mental illness labeling, stereotyping as weak, and social distance, than lesser endorsement of spiritual causal attributions and traditional gender role beliefs. However, greater endorsement of spiritual causal attributions and traditional gender role beliefs was also associated with relatively greater levels of stereotyping as violent. Subsequent analyses indicated that mental illness labeling moderated the relationships between spiritual causal attributions, stereotyping as weak and violent, and social distancing, as well as the relationships between traditional gender role beliefs, stereotyping as weak and violent and social distancing.

Abstract = {Objectives/Purpose. Disparities in access to and quality of mental health care for Latino immigrants in the United States are well documented. Lack of insurance and language barriers provide only a partial explanation for these inequities. Illness cognitions, including causal beliefs about depression may influence health care utilization and illness outcomes, but have not been well examined in previous research. Moreover, identification and treatment of depression may be difficult for primary care providers due to cultural differences in presentation of symptoms. The purposes of this cross-sectional study are: to explore causal attributions about depression; to identify psychosocial factors associated with these beliefs; and to describe the self-reported symptoms, illness labels and cultural idioms of distress of Latino primary care patients. Methods. We interviewed 177 primary care patients with instruments to assess causal beliefs, depressive and somatic symptoms, ethnic identity and stigma. An exploratory factor analysis of the Causal Beliefs scale yielded three factors, 'Balance,' 'Psychosocial' and 'Malevolent Spirituality/Transgressions' that were used as dependent variables in multivariate analyses. Results. Both psychological and religious (spiritual) explanations of illness were strongly endorsed by these respondents. Depressive symptoms, age, country of origin and religiosity were significant predictors of causal beliefs. Those with higher education were most likely to endorse Psychosocial and Balance causation beliefs. Stigma pertained to causal beliefs related to 'malevolent forces' and 'personal transgressions.' Participants' descriptions of symptoms had a predominantly somatic component. The most common complaints were ánimo bajo (low energy) and decaimiento (weakness). Conclusions. Latino respondents in primary care endorse a dual system of Western-medicine and traditional causation beliefs about depression. These results suggest culturally-specific interventions for improving health literacy as well as strategies for improving communication with patients about depression. To enhance treatment of depression in the primary care setting, it is important to take into account culturally accepted expressions of distress, and the meaning of illness for the individual.

Abstract = {This study investigated the roles of attribution styles within intimate relationships (e.g., relationship attribution style – causal and responsibility) in the development of dysfunctional sexual behaviors and cognitions (e.g., sexual motivation, sexual preoccupation, sexual anxiety, sexual depression, internal sexual control, and external sexual control) in adult female childhood sexual abuse (CSA) victims. One hundred and forty seven female participants between the ages of 18 and 54 (M = 23.84) completed this study; 87.8% of participants identified as Caucasian. Six hypotheses were tested; the main hypothesis of interest assessed if causal and/or responsibility attribution style would mediate the relationship between CSA and dysfunctional sexuality when controlling for covariates (substance use/psychopathology and emotion dysregulation). Results demonstrated that attribution style did not mediate the relationship between CSA and dysfunctional sexuality; however, attribution style did account for significant portions of variance in predicting dysfunctional sexuality. For example, causal attribution style (a) significantly predicted internal sexual control (which was not predicted by CSA and covariates), (b) accounted for a significant portion of variance in predicting sexual anxiety above/beyond CSA and covariates, and (c) accounted for a significant portion of variance in predicting decreased sexual motivation with women reporting higher levels of CSA. Responsibility attribution style significantly predicted internal sexual control (which was not significantly predicted by CSA and covariates) and accounted for a significant portion of variance over/above CSA and covariates in predicting sexual anxiety and sexual depression. Additionally, results demonstrated that substance use/psychopathology mediated the link between CSA and dysfunctional sexuality, specifically sexual preoccupation, sexual anxiety, and sexual depression. Results suggest that female CSA survivors who use substances, report psychological symptoms, and make maladaptive attributions for negative partner behaviors are at risk for negative outcomes regarding sexual behaviors and attitudes. Limitations include the self-report design of the study, as some participants noted that several items were confusing or ambiguous, the use of online sampling (e.g., missing data), and significant skewness/kurtosis of several study variables. Additionally, this study questioned participants on experiences that may have been aversive and/or distressing; thus, participants’ responses to these items may have been influenced due to the nature of the items.

Abstract = {Across all health care settings, certain patients are perceived as ‘difficult’ by clinicians. This paper’s aim is to understand how certain patients come to be perceived and labeled as ‘difficult’ patients in community mental health care, through mixed-methods research in The Netherlands between June 2006 and October 2009. A literature review, a Delphi-study among experts, a survey study among professionals, a Grounded Theory interview study among ‘difficult’ patients, and three case studies of ‘difficult’ patients were undertaken. Analysis of the results of these qualitative and quantitative studies took place within the concept of the sick role, and resulted in the construction of a tentative explanatory model. The ‘difficult’ patient-label is associated with professional pessimism, passive treatment and possible discharge or referral out of care. The label is given by professionals when certain patient characteristics are present and a specific causal attribution (psychological, social or moral versus neurobiological) about the patient’s behaviors is made. The status of ‘difficult’ patient is easily reinforced by subsequent patient and professional behavior, turning initial unusual help-seeking behavior into ‘difficult’ or ineffective chronic illness behavior, and ineffective professional behavior. These findings illustrate that the course of mental illness, or at least the course of patients’ contact with mental health professionals and services, is determined by patient and professional and reinforced by the social and mental health care system. This model adds to the broader sick role concept a micro-perspective in which attribution and learning principles are incorporated. On a practical level, it implies that professionals need to look into their own role in the perpetuation of difficult behaviors as described here.

Abstract = {Objective: Somatic causal illness attributions are being considered as potential positive criteria for somatoform disorders (SFDs) in DSM-V. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients diagnosed with SFDs tend towards a predominantly somatic attribution style. Methods: We compared the causal illness attributions of 48 SFD and 149 non-somatoform disorder patients, in a sample of patients presenting for an allergy diagnostic work-up, and those of 47 controls hospitalised for allergen-specific venom immunotherapy. The SFD diagnosis was established by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Both spontaneous and prompted causal illness attributions were recorded through interview and by means of the causal dimension of the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R), respectively. Patients' spontaneous and prompted responses were assigned to a psychosocial, somatic, or mixed attribution style. Results: Both in the free-response task and in their responses to the IPQ-R, SFD patients were no more likely than their nonsomatoform counterparts to focus on somatic explanations for their symptoms. They were just as likely to make psychosocial or mixed causal attributions. However, patients with SFDs were significantly more likely to find fault with medical care in the past. Conclusion: Our data do not support the use of somatic causal illness attributions as positive criteria for SFDs. They confirm the dynamic and multidimensional nature of causal illness attributions. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Sylvie Groben and Constanze Hausteiner (see record [rid]2011-03676-009[/rid]). The paper addresses a very relevant topic. Causal attributions were recorded with two methods: an interview (spontaneous recall) and the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire IPQ-R (prompted recall). Two aspects appear noteworthy to comment on. First, results show that subjects with somatoform disorders (SFDs) do not hold simplistic, monocausal illness attribution assumptions, but consider multiple causes as relevant to their symptoms. Overall, these findings are in line with some previous findings showing a considerable degree of mixed attributions in SFD even though a predominant somatic attribution style can be identified. Second, the authors shows that SFD patients were no more likely than non-SFD patients to exhibit somatic explanations for their symptoms. The authors conclude that somatic causal attributions should not be used as a positive criterion for future classifications as it lacks specificity. Actually, the current study does not provide support that a somatic causal attribution style has sufficient discriminant validity to qualify for a diagnostic criterion. Therefore, it is important that further prospective studies are performed to assess the relevance of symptom interpretation styles and of other psychological criteria and to investigate their impact on the course of the disorder — resulting in stronger empirical evidence for the selection of diagnostic criteria.

Abstract = {Background: It has been suggested that individuals from non-western countries tend to deny or mask psychological symptoms of common mental disorders and to present with somatic symptoms. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the association between common mental disorders and somatic symptoms in a representative sample of the general population of Santiago, Chile; Findings: This was a cross-sectional study of a stratified random sample of 3807 subjects living in private households in Santiago, Chile. Psychiatric disorders were assessed with the revised Clinical Interview Schedule. We found a strong association between the presence of somatic symptoms and psychiatric disorders (odds ratio 3.20, [95% confidence interval 2.52 - 4.05]). In addition, subjects who attributed their somatic symptoms to psychological or mixed psychological/physical causes were more likely to be cases compared to subjects who made physical attributions only (odds ratios 7.10 [95% CI 4.49-11.25] and 9.27 [6.00-14.34] respectively.; Conclusions: The study confirms previous observations from more selected samples that subjects of Hispanic origin are generally aware of the link between somatic symptoms and psychological ill-health and do not hide or "mask" their psychological symptoms.},

Abstract = {This study investigated whether a person’s belief in a just world (BJW), or knowing someone treated for a mental health problem, was related to their attitudes towards those with a diagnosis of mental illness or to their beliefs about the causes of mental health problems. One hundred and seventy-three participants completed a questionnaire measuring BJW, attitudes towards, and causal beliefs about, mental health problems. No relationship was found between BJW and attitudes, nor between psychosocial causal beliefs and attitudes. However, biogenetic causal beliefs were associated with attitudes. Those who knew someone who had received treatment for a mental health problem had lower biogenetic belief scores than those who did not. However, there were no differences between the two groups in BJW, attitudes or psychosocial beliefs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Māori (the Indigenous people of New Zealand) are disproportionately affected by mental illness and experience significantly poorer mental health compared to New Zealand Europeans. It is important to understand cultural differences in patients’ ideas about mental illness in treatment settings. The aim of the present study was to investigate differences in illness perceptions between Māori and New Zealand Europeans diagnosed with schizophrenia. Method: A total of 111 users of mental health services (68 Māori, 43 New Zealand European) in the greater Auckland and Northland areas who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder were interviewed using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and the Drug Attitude Inventory. District Health Board staff completed the Global Assessment of Functioning for each patient. Results: Māori with schizophrenia believed that their illness would continue significantly less time than New Zealand European patients did. Chance or spiritual factors were listed as causes of mental illness by only five Māori patients and no New Zealand European patients. Other illness perceptions, as well as attitudes towards medication, were comparable between groups. Across groups, the top perceived causes were drugs/alcohol, family relationships/abuse, and biological causes. Conclusion: Illness perceptions provide a framework to assess patients ’ beliefs about their mental illness. Differences between Māori and New Zealand European patients ’ beliefs about their mental illness may be related to traditional Māori beliefs about mental illness. Knowledge of differences in illness perceptions provides an opportunity to design effective clinical interventions for both Māori and New Zealand Europeans.

Abstract = {Background: Community facilitators (CFs), such as pharmacists, policemen, teachers and clergy, may be an important community resource for patients with depression in addition to (mental) health professionals. However, they are ill prepared for such a role and little is known about their attitudes toward depression, which may affect practice. Aim: To investigate CFs’ attitudes toward depression and compare them to those of (mental) health professionals and nurses. Method: Attitudes were assessed in participants (n=2,670) of training programmes about depression in nine countries of the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD). The EAAD questionnaire included attitudes toward depression and its treatment, perceived causes, preferred treatment options, and knowledge of depression symptoms. Results: CFs and nurses had a more negative attitude toward patients with depression and toward antidepressants, and more limited knowledge of depression symptoms than (mental) health professionals. CFs more frequently supported non-standard treatment for depression. Nurse assistants clearly differed from registered nurses with their attitudes being among the least favourable and their knowledge the most limited of all groups. Conclusions: CFs and nurses had less favourable attitudes and more limited knowledge regarding depression when compared to mental health professionals and doctors. This may negatively affect professional collaboration, challenge optimal treatment and stigmatize patients. CFs’ and nurses’ knowledge and attitudes may be similar to those of the general population and be related to a lack of training in mental health issues.

Abstract = {Background: The results of studies on perceived causes and stigma have been varied and inconsistent, with no studies examining this relationship in Canada. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between biological, psychosocial, and medical causal beliefs in depression and stigma against depression. Methods: We randomly recruited participants in Alberta, aged 18–74 (n = 3047, response rate 75.2%), for a cross-sectional telephone survey between February and June 2006, using random digit dialing. Participants were presented with a case vignette describing a depressed individual and responded to a personal stigma and depression causation questionnaire. Stigma scores were analyzed using Wald tests and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Nearly all respondents endorsed a psychosocial (99.1%) or genetic (96.4%) cause of depression. Participants who endorsed genetic cause of depression had a lower mean stigma scores than others. Logistic regression modeling showed that endorsing depression due to 'being a nervous person' was associated with increased odds of having stigmatizing attitudes. Limitations: Recall and social desirability response biases were possible due to reliance on self report. Conclusions: It is encouraging that 99% of participants endorsed a psychosocial cause of depression. There is no evidence that endorsing a biological cause of depression could increase stigma. To disseminate scientific knowledge in the process of mental health education and promotion, language shall be carefully crafted to avoid unnecessary stigma.

Abstract = {Background: Causal belief systems and help-seeking practices may impact on pathway to care and features of first-episode psychosis (FEP) that have prognostic value. This is particularly relevant in South Africa where many people subscribe to traditional belief systems and consult traditional healers. Aim: To evaluate the relationship between causal attributions and pathway to care and features of FEP that have prognostic value. Method: We tested associations between causal attributions and pathway to care and duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), age of onset, PANSS-rated positive, negative and general symptoms and depressive symptoms (Calgary Depression Scale) in a sample of 54 FEP patients. Results: Spiritual attribution of cause (49% of patients) was associated with long DUP, while consultation with a traditional healer (39% of patients) was associated with long DUP and high negative symptoms. Only 19% had consulted a psychiatrist. Seventy nine per cent (79%) were referred to hospital by family, police were involved in 44% of admissions, and 81% were admitted involuntarily. Conclusions: Spiritual attributions of cause and previous consultation with traditional healers may delay entry to psychiatric care and thereby negatively impact on prognosis of FEP. This highlights the importance of mental health education and developing a positive collaborative relationship with traditional healers, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Abstract = {Research into the general public's responses to individuals with intellectual disabilities has been dominated by attitudinal research. While this approach has unquestionably generated useful findings, it ignores important aspects, such as lay knowledge, explanatory models and beliefs about suitable interventions that can produce a multi-faceted understanding of public responses. This paper describes the development of a measure designed to assess respondents’ intellectual disability literacy. Following a pilot with 114 participants, the IDLS was revised and then completed by 1376 members of the public (aged 18–78 years) from diverse cultural backgrounds. The measure was able to distinguish respondents who showed good intellectual disability literacy. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed four causal beliefs factors (adversity, biomedical, fate, environment) that accounted for 55% of the variance and three intervention beliefs factors (lifestyle, expert help, religion/spiritual,) that explained 52% of the variance. Test–retest reliability for these factors was good for all ethnic groups. The four-item social distance scale had good internal consistency for all ethnic groups and acceptable concurrent validity. The IDLS is a useful new tool to evaluate knowledge, beliefs and social distance to intellectual disability in lay people, is suitable for cross-cultural research and allows comparison of intellectual disability and mental health literacy in any given population.

Abstract = {Background: Mental health and psychosocial wellbeing are key concerns in displaced populations. Despite urban refugees constituting more than half of the world's refugees, minimal attention has been paid to their psychosocial wellbeing. The purpose of this study was to assess coping behaviour and aspects of resilience amongst refugees in Kathmandu, Nepal.; Methods: This study examined the experiences of 16 Pakistani and 8 Somali urban refugees in Kathmandu, Nepal through in-depth individual interviews, focus groups, and Photovoice methodology. Such qualitative approaches enabled us to broadly discuss themes such as personal experiences of being a refugee in Kathmandu, perceived causes of psychosocial distress, and strategies and resources for coping. Thematic network analysis was used in this study to systematically interpret and code the data.; Results: Our findings highlight that urban refugees' active coping efforts, notwithstanding significant adversity and resulting distress, are most frequently through primary relationships. Informed by Axel Honneth's theory on the struggle for recognition, findings suggest that coping is a function beyond the individual and involves the ability to negotiate recognition. This negotiation involves not only primary relationships, but also the legal order and other social networks such as family and friends. Honneth's work was used because of its emphasis on the importance of legal recognition and larger structural factors in facilitating daily coping.; Conclusions: Understanding how urban refugees cope by negotiating access to various forms of recognition in the absence of legal-recognition will enable organisations working with them to leverage such strengths and develop relevant programmes. In particular, building on these existing resources will lead to culturally compelling and sustainable care for these populations.},

Abstract = {Background: Despite an apparent high interest in predictive genetic testing for common multifactorial disorders, few data describe anticipated health behaviour as a consequence of such testing. Methods: A large population-based public survey with community dwelling adults (N=1046) ascertained through random digit dialling. Attitudes were assessed via structured interviews. Results: Intention to start therapies or courses to learn to develop better strategies to cope with stress (80%) was significantly and positively associated with self-estimation of risk for major depressive disorder as higher than average (ß=0.12, p=0.001); endorsement of family environment as a causal attribution (ß=0.11, p<0.001); and endorsement of gene–environment interaction as a causal mechanism of mental illness (ß=0.12, p=0.017). Intention to modify potential life stressors (84%) was significantly and positively associated with self-estimation of risk for depression as higher than average (ß=0.07, p=0.029); endorsement of ‘abuse’ as a causal attribution (ß=0.10, p=0.003); and endorsement of ‘gene–environment interaction’ as a causal mechanism (ß=0.10, p=0.002). Limitations: The hypothetical nature of the genetic risk scenario may have weakened participants' sensitivity to the potential personal impact of such a genetic test result. Conclusions: Perceptions that modifiable environmental factors strongly contribute to overall risk of major depressive disorder appeared to drive willingness to engage in risk-modifying interventions in the hypothetical scenario of a genetic predisposition. Our results suggest that screening for genetic risk in consort with environmental risk factor assessment has potential community acceptability and clinical value as an early intervention and preventive tool for high risk groups.

Abstract = {Background: Biological or genetic models of mental illness are commonly expected to increase tolerance towards people with mental illness, by reducing notions of responsibility and blame. Aims: To investigate whether biogenetic causal attributions of mental illness among the general public are associated with more tolerant attitudes, whether such attributions are related to lower perceptions of guilt and responsibility, to what extent notions of responsibility are associated with rejection of people who are mentally ill, and how prevalent notions of responsibility are among the general public with regard to different mental disorders. Method: A systematic review was conducted of representative population studies examining attitudes towards people with mental illness and beliefs about such disorders. Results: We identified 33 studies relevant to this review. Generally, biogenetic causal attributions were not associated with more tolerant attitudes; they were related to stronger rejection in most studies examining schizophrenia. No published study reported on associations of biogenetic causal attributions and perceived responsibility. The stereotype of self-responsibility was unrelated to rejection in most studies. Public images of mental disorder are generally dominated by the stereotypes of unpredictability and dangerousness, whereas responsibility is less relevant. Conclusions: Biogenetic causal models are an inappropriate means of reducing rejection of people with mental illness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{2183519720111201,
Abstract = {Helplessness is a major concept in depression and a major theme in preclinical and clinical depression research. For example, in rodents and humans, the learned helplessness (LH) effect describes a specific deficit in behaviour to control aversive stimuli that is induced by prior exposure to uncontrollable aversive stimuli. The LH effect is objective and valid in that the cause of the behavioural deficit, namely uncontrollability, is clear; furthermore, the deficit induced is underlain by emotional, motivational and cognitive processes that are relevant to depression psychopathology. As a further example, helplessness, hopelessness, external locus of control and causal attribution are inter-related and major themes in psychological theories (primarily cognitive theories) of depression. Despite this broad interest in helplessness, it can be argued that its potential usefulness as a scientific and clinical concept has so far not been investigated optimally, including with respect to its application in research aimed at development of improved anti-depressant pharmacotherapy. The first aim of this review was to describe and integrate the psychological evidence and the neurobiological evidence for the LH effect in rodents and healthy humans and for helplessness in depressed patients. The second aim was to conduct three systematic reviews, namely of rodent studies of the LH effect, rodent studies of effects of psychopharmacological agents on the LH effect, and human studies of efficacy of pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic treatment on helplessness in depressed patients. With respect to the first aim, the major findings are: the specificity of the LH effect in otherwise non-manipulated rodents and healthy humans has been under-estimated, and the LH effect is a specific learned aversive uncontrollability (LAU) effect. There is theoretical and empirical support for a model in which a specific LAU effect induced by a life event of major emotional significance can function as an aetiological factor for generalised helplessness which can in turn function as an aetiological and maintenance factor for depression. However, to date such models have focused on cognitive mediating processes whereas it is emotional-motivational-cognitive processes (as proposed for the LAU effect) that need to be invoked and understood. The evidence is for analogous neural processes underlying the LAU effect in rodents and healthy humans and helplessness in depression, with the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex exhibiting aversive uncontrollability-dependent activity. With respect to the second aim, the major findings are: the LAU effect is demonstrated quite consistently using a number of different paradigms in rat but is poorly studied in mouse. The rat LAU effect can be reversed by chronic administration of monoamine reuptake inhibitors. The effects of antidepressants on human helplessness have been scarcely studied to-date. The major conclusion is that the LAU effect and generalised helplessness constitute major neuropsychological concepts of high value to future translational research aimed at increased understanding of depression and development of novel, improved antidepressant treatments.

Abstract = {Despite growing concerns of over-treatment, the under-diagnosis and undertreatment of major depressive disorders is still prevalent. Causal attributions are thought to be involved in help seeking behavior, time to diagnosis and the chance for successful referral. Yet, little is known about the extent to which these processes are influenced by causal attributions. 120 patients, involved in the nationwide second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (Schellevis, Westert, & Bakker, 2005), with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of depression, severe depression or with a depression lasting over six months, completed a causal attributions inventory. Demographic and clinical data from the survey, and causal attribution scores were used as independent variables in association with getting a diagnosis of depression from the general practitioner, or being in treatment by a mental health care provider for more than 3 sessions. Causal attributions related to intrapsychic fears were significantly associated with getting a diagnosis of depression and successful referral. Causal attributions related to childhood were also positively associated with successful referral. In association models derived from all the demographic and clinical data available in the survey, causal attributions substantially contributed to the explained variance, 55% and 39% respectively. The findings suggest causal attributions have a statistically significant impact on time to diagnosis and the chance of successful referral. Using the Causal Attribution Inventory with high-risk patients in primary care might enhance the chance of detection and successful referral of depressed patients.

Forty-two Chinese Americans participated in semistructured interviews using established psychological measures and open-ended questions adapted from the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue. The authors found that care utilization appears to be complicated by somatization of emotional problems, variations in causal attribution to depression, barriers to receiving mental health care, and the burden of comorbid physical conditions. Their findings highlight the importance of addressing these issues and educating patients about body-mind dialectic common to depression.},

Abstract = {Street children, or children who live and/or spend time on the streets, are a vulnerable group of considerable concern to the global public health community. This paper describes the results of two linked qualitative studies conducted with children living or spending time on the street and in orphanages in and around urban areas in the Republic of Georgia between 2005 and 2006. The studies examined perceived causes of children going to the street, as well as indicators of healthy functioning and psychosocial problems among these children. Results on causes indicated a range of "push" factors leading children to the street and "pull" factors that keep children living on the street. Findings also showed a range of internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms among children on the street and within orphanages. Some differences in responses were found between children living on the street and in institutions. It is important to understand the perspectives of these vulnerable populations to guide decisions on appropriate interventions that address their primary problems.},

Abstract = {Expectancy value theory as modified by Atkinson, locus of control research initiated by Rotter, and the naive psychology of achievement performance advanced by Heider provided the stepping stones for the formulation of the attribution theories of motivation presented in this chapter. Two theories are reviewed—an intrapersonal conception that primarily addresses achievement striving, and an interpersonal theory that focuses on social behaviors including help-giving, aggression, and reactions to the stigmatized. Causal beliefs, their underlying properties, and distinctive links to emotions form the foundation for these theories, which suggest a thinking-feeling-action sequence as the 'deep structure' for motivated behavior. Application of the theories to achievement striving, physical and mental health, and social support are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The study had the following objectives: To elicit poverty causal attributions among Ugandan university students; assess beliefs about the role of organizations in the causation of poverty, the role of organizations in poverty reduction, the effects of poverty, ways of reducing poverty, and assess how organizational psychologists can help to reduce poverty. A convenient sample of 236 Ugandan university students were opportunistically selected, and completed a questionnaire that assessed background characteristics, attributions for poverty, effects for poverty and its reduction, and role of organizations in the causation and reduction of poverty. Data was analysed using percentages. Causes of poverty were categorized as individualistic, fatalistic, structuralist, third world governments, international exploitation and conflict. Poverty was reported to have serious effects on people's social lives, on the families and on mental health. Ways of reducing poverty by government, development partners, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and organizational psychologists, and above all ways of dealing with poverty attributions, (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Institutionalized heterosexism, biphobia, transphobia, and discriminatory treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth, as well as inadequate access to culturally and linguistically responsive resources, have resulted in considerable disparities in services and supports for LGBT youth. These social inequities can exacerbate behavioral health challenges because youth do not receive appropriate care from the systems and individuals they and their families turn to for support during times of need. Systems of care provide an organizing framework and a set of values for how communities can deliver effective mental health services and supports to children, youth, and their families. This book has adopted a public health approach to highlight how system of care communities and individuals can apply system of care principles and values to ensure that these systems are 'good fits' for LGBT youth and their families. In addition to providing a blueprint for approaches to services and supports in systems of care to enhance outcomes for LGBT youth, this book has raised significant issues and advanced several concepts (e.g., assets-based approaches to services and research; LGBT-affirming clinical interventions; culturally and linguistically competent approaches to service delivery for youth who are LGBT, two-spirit, or have differences in sexual development; guidelines for working with LGBT headed families).'We anticipate that the content of this book will support the efforts of others to identify and implement additional promising strategies and effective approaches. Youth participating in systems of care may exhibit large individual differences in their degree of exposure to institutionalized heterosexism, transphobia, fear, stigma, adversity, and violence. Many, if not most, LGBT youth have experienced trauma and may benefit from a trauma-informed approach to the delivery of services and supports from entry into services and throughout their tenure in systems of care. Accordingly, those building systems of care and individual service providers working with LGBT youth should address the impact of sociocultural development and factors associated with the youth, family, and community in all aspects of their planning, outreach, assessments, and interventions. Furthermore, Lazear and Gamache point out the importance of addressing the benefits of LGBT-specific assets and resources as well as the effects of negative life events, sociocultural aspects of the clinician-patient interaction, help-seeking behaviors and coping styles, stigma and other social stressors, and perceived causes of symptoms and behaviors. Despite these challenges, LGBT youth who experience multiple challenges are often fiercely resilient and resourceful, and it is critical to capitalize on the strengths these youth demonstrate.

Abstract = {Background: Attempted suicide, a deliberate self-directed behavior situated within the unique social world of an individual, is a major risk factor for suicide. Efforts aimed at addressing female suicide must be based on understanding their perceived causes and the meaning of this behavior. Aims: This study describes the perceived causes of suicidal behaviors to determine preventive measures of female suicide in China. Methods: An in-depth interview about the process and causes of suicidal behavior as well as a detailed structured and a standardized diagnostic interview were administered to 244 female attempters treated at general hospitals and, separately, to their relatives. Results: The perceived three most frequent causes of the attempts were interpersonal conflict (87%), psychological problems (33%), and conflict between others that affected the subject (27%). On average 2.2 causes were identified for each case. The identification in the in-depth interviews of psychological problems as a cause of the attempt was concordant with the results of the independent psychiatric exam identifying a current DSM-IV mental disorder in 38% of cases (Kappa = 0.64). Conclusions: Preventive measures of improving interpersonal and problem-solving skills should be developed and assessed for addressing female suicide in China besides expansion of psychiatric services.

Abstract = {Research findings from the Western countries have consistently supported the attribution model, demonstrating that stigma towards persons with mental illness is influenced by attributions about the causes of their illness and personal responsibility beliefs. Employing the framework of the attribution model (Corrigan, Markowitz, Watson, Rowan & Kubiak, 2003; Weiner, 1985), the current study examined whether attribution theory could be applied in Chinese culture to understand Chinese college students' attitude towards people with mental illness. In addition, an alternative severity model was proposed to explain possible psychological mechanisms influencing severity appraisal and mental illness stigma. Using an experimental design with hypothetical vignettes, the relationships between causal attributions (e.g., controllability, responsibility), severity, emotional responses (e.g., pity, fear, shame-anger), and helping and coercive responses were estimated in a sample of 293 college students from two universities in China. Results from the hierarchical regression analyses only partially supported the attribution model. Consistent with attribution theory, the causes of mental illness affected responsibility beliefs, which, in turn, led to emotional responses that influenced willingness to help. However, when coercion was the outcome variable, the findings did not support the attribution model as the effect of responsibility was not mediated by the controllability of cause. Consistent with a severity hypothesis, the effects of severity on both helping and coercion were not mediated by responsibility beliefs, but operated directly via shame-anger and fear. Severity was also found to moderate the relationship between helping and coercion. Overviews of the conceptual and methodological limitations in applying the attribution model to study mental illness stigma in China as well as practical implications for stigma reduction intervention, and directions for future research are discussed. This research contributes to the ongoing knowledge pertaining to mental illness stigma and identification of culturally specific factors, mechanisms, and processes associated with stigma towards persons with mental illness in China, thus providing valuable insights into the development of culturally-sensitive anti-stigma interventions.

Abstract = {After almost four decades of burnout research, researchers still do not clearly understand the process of burnout. This study utilized grounded theory to address this deficiency and provide a theoretical framework of transitional stages that captures the developmental course of this phenomenon as it is endured by community mental health counselors. Five distinct but related themes emerged which represent psychological phases the participants encountered as burnout progressed. These were vulnerability, inconsistent self, questioning competency, negative perspicacity, and loss of meaning. The results of this study indicate that this phenomenon is, to an extent, self-made through cognitive appraisals that are associated with the psychological process of burnout. The ongoing interplay between a demanding environment and burnout symptoms appears to be mediated by the nature of these appraisals involving causal attributions and evaluations of the significance of one's work. The narrative data revealed burnout begins and is sustained by negative interpretations of job experiences and a persistent focus on causes which eventually lead to a profound loss of meaning. It is suggested that interventions to address this phenomenon consider ways to help counselors shift their focus from negative causal attributions to rediscovering the intrinsic value of their work through meaning-focused coping strategies. Newly emerging research and the results of the present study affirm the value of studying burnout through an existential perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate (1) the prevalence of occupational violence in out-of-hours (OOH) primary care, (2) the perceived cause of violence, and (3) the associations between occupation, gender, age, years of work, and occupational violence. Design: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered postal questionnaire. Setting: Twenty Norwegian OOH primary care centres. Subjects: Physicians, nurses, and others with patient contact at OOH primary care centres, 536 responders (75% response rate). Main outcome measures: Verbal abuse, threats, physical abuse, sexual harassment. Results: In total, 78% had been verbally abused, 44% had been exposed to threats, 13% physically abused, and 9% sexually harassed during the last 12 months. Significantly more nurses were associated with verbal abuse (OR 3.85, 95% confidence interval 2.17–6.67) after adjusting for gender, age, and years in OOH primary care. Males had a higher risk for physical abuse (OR 2.36, CI 1.11–5.05) and higher age was associated with lower risk for sexual harassment (OR 0.28, CI 0.14–0.59), when adjusted for background variables. Drug influence and mental illness were the most frequently perceived causes for the last occurring episode of physical abuse, threats, and verbal abuse. Conclusion: This first study on occupational violence in Norwegian OOH primary care found that a substantial number of health care workers experience occupational violence from patients or visitors. The employer should take action to prevent occupational violence in OOH primary care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by D. Sanders et al. (see record [rid]2011-10141-009[/rid]). We read with interest the paper by Sanders and colleagues investigating the perceptions of schizophrenia among Māori and non-Māori. It is pleasing to see research that attempts to give voice to the experience and views of tangata whaiora regarding their illnesses and future. However, the presentation and interpretation of the findings in this study raise some concerns. The authors introduce historical Māori views of mental illness such as described by Te Rangi Hiroa in the early 20th century and appear to intimate the renaissance of Māori culture may mean a return to these beliefs about mental illness and may subsequently contribute to reduced medication compliance. This assumption pervades the title, discussion and conclusions despite their results demonstrating the general lack of difference between Māori and non Māori views. While the potential selection bias is acknowledged this warrants highlighting. The sample consisted of 68 Māori who were all high users of mental health services, with unknown duration of illness, interviewed by mental health consumers with a response rate as low as 55% to the causal beliefs question. Furthermore the causal beliefs section is described as open-ended and would have been better presented using a qualitative research method. Concluding that 'differences between Māori and New Zealand European patients' beliefs about mental illness may be related to Māori traditional beliefs about mental illness' seems an exaggeration of the generalizability of this study given these concerns, along with the results failing to demonstrate this difference. If this study had been presented as 'Māori and non-Māori shared attitudes to medication' and the positive attitudes to medication emphasized, this may have aided combating some psychiatrists' views such as 'Māori just don't take medication' as previously identified in research in this journal.

Abstract = {Context: Representations of illness have been studied in several populations, but research is limited in palliative care. Objectives: To describe illness representations in a population with advanced disease receiving palliative care and to examine the relationship between illness perceptions, adaptive coping, and depression. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 301 consecutive eligible patients recruited from a palliative care service in south London, U.K. Measures used included the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief IPQ), the Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) Scale, and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Results: Scores were not normally distributed for most questions on the Brief IPQ. The correlations found between items on the Brief IPQ were understandable in the context of advanced disease. MAC helplessness-hopelessness and fighting spirit were highly correlated with items on the Brief IPQ in opposite directions. The Brief IPQ domains of consequences, identity, concern, personal control, and emotion were associated with depression, a relationship that was not explained by adaptive coping. Seven causal attribution themes were identified: don’t know, personal responsibility, exposure, pathological process, intrinsic personal factors, chance, fate or luck, and other. Both lung cancer diagnosis and gender were found to be independently associated with personal responsibility attribution. None of the attribution themes were associated with the presence of depression. Conclusion: Assessment of illness perceptions in palliative care is likely to yield important information about risk of depression and will help clinicians to personalize management of advanced disease.

In addition, the TBI Clinical Reminder Screen, when compared with the Comprehensive TBI Evaluation by a clinician, has generally poor negative predictive power (.31-.49) in this sample. However, negative predictive power is good with an estimated Veterans Health Administration system-wide TBI prevalence rate of 15% (.89). Positive predictive power was acceptable (.77) in this sample. The screen performs comparably across patient demographic and symptom severity characteristics, as well as across level of polytrauma care. Systematic evaluations by clinicians primarily reveal mental health-perceived causes of ongoing symptoms.; Conclusions: In summary, VA's Clinical Reminder Screen, when evaluated against the follow-up Comprehensive TBI Evaluation, has good sensitivity but poor specificity.

Abstract = {Historically, organized violence has been a chronic pervasive problem in Haiti. We set out to elicit Haitians’ views on its effects to guide the development of interventions. In March 2006 we studied a population in the slum area of Cap-Haitien, Haiti’s second largest city, and the nearby towns of Milot and Limbe. A convenience sample of adults was asked to free list all current problems affecting victims of organized violence. Two major categories emerged: psychological problems and financial problems. The psychological problems of 'feeling startled and loss of self control,' 'sadness/grief,' 'continuing to suffer from reliving/reexperiencing past events,' 'problems in the head/mental problems,' 'deep suffering in the heart,' and 'thinking too much' emerged as themes from key-informant interviews. These may correspond to constructs of depression, dysthymia, and anxiety disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder in psychiatric nosology. The development of effective interventions can therefore consider those known to be effective for these problems in other settings. However in selecting interventions, considerations must also include local acceptability, perceived causes of problems, and their social effects.

Abstract = {Background: Culture affects the way people conceptualize causes of severe mental disturbance which may lead to a variation in the preferred intervention methods. There is a seemingly dichotomous belief regarding what causes severe mental disturbance: people living in western countries tend to focus mainly on biological and psychosocial risk factors; whereas, in non-western countries the focus is mainly on supernatural and religious factors. These belief systems about causation potentially dictate the type of intervention preferred. Studying such belief systems in any society is expected to help in planning and implementation of appropriate mental health services. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted among the Borana semi-nomadic population in southern Ethiopia to explore perceived causes of severe mental disturbance and preferred interventions. We selected, using purposive sampling, key informants from three villages and conducted a total of six focus group discussions: three for males and three for females. Results: The views expressed regarding the causes of mental disturbance were heterogeneous encompassing supernatural causes such as possession by evil spirits, curse, bewitchment, ‘exposure to wind’ and subsequent attack by evil spirit in postnatal women and biopsychosocial causes such as infections (malaria), loss, ‘thinking too much’, and alcohol and khat abuse. The preferred interventions for severe mental disturbance included mainly indigenous approaches, such as consulting Borana wise men or indigenous healers, prayer, holy water treatment and seeking modern mental health care as a last resort. Conclusions: These findings will be of value for health care planners who wish to expand modern mental health care to this population, indicating the need to increase awareness about the causes of severe mental disturbance and their interventions and collaborate with influential people and indigenous healers to increase acceptability of modern mental health care. It also provides information for further research in the area of mental health in this semi-nomadic population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Aim: Caregiver causal attributions influence patient and caregiver reactions to psychosis. The current study describes common caregiver causal attributions about psychosis onset in youth, including a subset of first episode psychosis patients, and the patient and caregiver characteristics that influence these attributions. It also examines if caregiver views are affected by contact with youth mental health services. Methods: Fifty-one caregivers of 50 youth patients with a diagnosed Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) psychotic disorder were interviewed about their causal attributions. Patient and caregiver demographic and clinical predictors were also collected. Results: Caregivers most highly endorsed substance use, genetics, negative peer influences and school stress as individual causes. These findings were consistent across the total sample. Principal components analysis derived three causal categories. Caregivers most frequently endorsed a biological and substance use lifestyle causal category, followed by psychological vulnerability and stress-reactivity causal categories. There was evidence that caregiver and patient factors, as well as contact with youth mental health services, influenced the causal attributions caregivers made about the onset of psychosis. Conclusion: Caregivers of youth with psychosis are making causal attributions that are consistent with current aetiological theories of psychosis in youth. The study showed that caregivers are particularly cognizant of genetic and substance use factors in the development and maintenance of psychosis. However, youth mental health services may need to particularly focus on increasing caregiver understanding of the dynamics of stress factors as symptoms, and not causes, of psychosis early in the illness course.

Abstract = {Identifying factors that facilitate treatment for psychotic disorders among Chinese-immigrants is crucial due to delayed treatment use. Identifying causal beliefs held by relatives that might predict identification of ‘mental illness’ as opposed to other ‘indigenous labels’ may promote more effective mental health service use. We examine what effects beliefs of ‘physical causes’ and other non-biomedical causal beliefs (‘general social causes’, and ‘indigenous Chinese beliefs’ or culture-specific epistemologies of illness) might have on mental illness identification. Forty-nine relatives of Chinese-immigrant consumers with psychosis were sampled. Higher endorsement of ‘physical causes’ was associated with mental illness labeling. However among the non-biomedical causal beliefs, ‘general social causes’ demonstrated no relationship with mental illness identification, while endorsement of ‘indigenous Chinese beliefs’ showed a negative relationship. Effective treatment- and community-based psychoeducation, in addition to emphasizing biomedical models, might integrate indigenous Chinese epistemologies of illness to facilitate rapid identification of psychotic disorders and promote treatment use.

Abstract = {Setting: In Morocco, tuberculosis (TB) treatment default is increasing in some urban areas.; Objective: To provide a detailed description of factors that contribute to patient default and solutions from the point of view of health care professionals who participate in TB care.; Design: In-depth interviews were conducted with 62 physicians and nurses at nine regional public pulmonary clinics and local health clinics.; Results: Participants had a median of 24 years of experience in health care. Treatment default was seen as a result of multilevel factors related to the patient (lack of means, being a migrant worker, distance to treatment site, poor understanding of treatment, drug use, mental illness), medical team (high patient load, low motivation, lack of resources for tracking defaulters), treatment organization (poor communication between treatment sites, no systematic strategy for patient education or tracking, incomplete record keeping), and health care system and society. Tailored recommendations for low- and higher-cost interventions are provided.; Conclusions: Interventions to enhance TB treatment completion should take into account the local context and multilevel factors that contribute to default. Qualitative studies involving health care workers directly involved in TB care can be powerful tools to identify contributing factors and define strategies to help reduce treatment default.},

Abstract = {Several studies have tested Weiner’s model, which suggests a relationship among causal attributions regarding challenging behavior (CB), emotions, and helping behavior of staff. No studies have focused on interpersonal styles. The goals of this study were to investigate the influence of type of CB on attributions, emotions and interpersonal style of staff, the relationships among staff attributions, emotions, and interpersonal style, and the mediating function of emotions in the relation between attributions and interpersonal style. Participants were 99 staff members. CB aimed at the environment was related to higher levels of negative emotions, attributions and certain interpersonal styles such as controlling behavior. In addition, a relationship between emotions, attributions, and interpersonal style was found. However, there was no mediating function of emotions in the relationships between attributions and interpersonal style. Future research should take a more dynamic view of staff behavior and staff–client interaction into account. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: India is a country of several diversities and cultures, which may influence the help-seeking behavior of mentally ill patients and families. Only a few Indian studies have focused on help seeking, especially for severe mental disorders.; Objective: The study aimed to describe and compare the help-seeking behaviors among caregivers of psychotic patients visiting psychiatric clinics at two distinct cities of India.; Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional exploratory study of key caregivers (N=50) of patients with a DSM-IV TR diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, visiting psychiatric out-patient departments of VIMHANS, New Delhi, and CIMS, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh. After due informed consent was taken, a semi-structured proforma was administered for socio-demographic profile, illness details, causative beliefs, and information on help seeking.; Results: Supernatural forces were held responsible by 40% of the Bilaspur sample in contrast to 8% in New Delhi sample. Faith-healers were initial contacts for 56% and 64% of sample, respectively, at New Delhi and Bilaspur. Faith-healers followed by a psychiatrist formed the commonest pathway of care at both centers (32% and 36%, respectively). The sample at New Delhi spent significantly more money (median: $4000 vs. $10) and traveled greater distances (median: 35 km vs. 10 km) for faith-healers during the course of illness. Two-thirds of sample in New Delhi and one-third at Bilaspur were aware of the nearby psychiatrist at the time of initial help seeking; however, only 28% and 12%, respectively, chose psychiatrist as an initial contact. The New Delhi sample reported a fear of medication adverse effects and stigma as perceived disadvantages of psychiatric help. The median time lost at both the centers was 1 month, with a maximum of 8.4 years in New Delhi and 4.9 years in Bilaspur. Of the total, 16% caregivers at New Delhi and 32% at Bilaspur center reported an intention to continue with faith-healing practices alongside psychiatric care.; Conclusion: In spite of differing causal attributions, the patients and families across these cities may not be as different when it comes to behaviors related to help seeking for mental illness. Future large-scale studies across various regions of India may help in determining sociocultural and regional patterns of help seeking in greater detail.},

Abstract = {A large body of research exists examining the associations between etiological beliefs and attitudes about mental illness. However, relatively little research has investigated the effects of portraying mental illness as a product of combined biological and psychosocial factors. Two experimental studies exposed participants to either biological, environmental, or combined etiological information about mental disorders associated with violent and nonviolent behavior. Combined etiological information increased belief in both biological and environmental causes. It also increased essentialist beliefs in one study. However, combined etiological information was not more effective at reducing stigma than other etiological information and did not interact with level of violence. Overall, causal beliefs emerged as less important to stigma than disorders’ perceived associations with violence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {An efficacious treatment is diminished in value if consumers do not seek it out and adhere to it, making treatment acceptability an important predictor of the effectiveness of treatment. This study examined the acceptability of treatments for depression to 67 female high school students. All participants read a vignette describing a depressed adolescent and rated the acceptability of four single treatments for depression (cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, family therapy, and pharmacotherapy) and three treatment combinations. Psychotherapy approaches were generally more acceptable to adolescents than combinations of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy; and, pharmacotherapy used alone was not acceptable. For interpersonal therapy and family therapy only, treatment acceptability was related to perceived causes of depression. Across all treatments, acceptability was not associated with symptom severity. Implications for increasing the utilization of mental health services in this population are discussed.

Abstract = {Rates, demographics and diagnostics, which are the focus of many studies of suicide, may provide an insufficient account without adequate consideration of psychological, social and cultural contexts and motives. Furthermore, reported explanations of suicide are shaped not only by events but also the relationship of survivor respondents explaining the suicide. An explanatory model interview for sociocultural autopsy has been used to assess underlying problems and perceived causes. This study in a low income community of Mumbai in 2003e2004 compared accounts of the closest family survivors and more distant relationships. Our study design distinguished series-level agreement (i.e., consistency of accounts within a group) and case-level agreement for particular cases. Serious mental illness was the perceived cause reported by a respondent in either group for 22.0% of index suicides, but case-level agreement was only 6.0%. Regarding financial stressors, more closely related family respondents focused on acute stressors instead of enduring effects of poverty. Case-level agreement was high for marital problems, but low for other sources of family conflict. Tension was a feature of suicide reported in both groups, but case-level agreement on tension as a perceived cause was low (kappa = 0.14). The role of alcohol as a perceived cause of suicide had high series level agreement (46.0% in both groups) and case-level agreement (kappa = 0.60), suggesting comparable community and professional views of its significance. The study shows that it is relevant and feasible to consider general community patterns and particular survivor interests. Findings from this study recommend an approach to sociocultural autopsy to assess reasons for suicide in community studies. Findings clarify diverse views of underlying problems motivating suicide that should be considered to make mental health care more effective in assessing risk and preventing suicide.

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the relation of disability and physical and mental health status with potentially traumatic life events (PTLE) before the onset of fibromyalgia in women diagnosed with this syndrome. We also investigated causal attribution of fibromyalgia to a triggering event, physical or psychological in nature, and its relation with the health measures and the adverse life events. The impact of fibromyalgia, physical and mental health status, pain, PTLE in childhood and not in childhood, and causal attribution were assessed in a sample of 50 women with fibromyalgia, aged 25-70 (M = 46.96; SD = 10.96). There were no statistically significant relations between the health measures (disability, physical and mental health, and pain) and the PTLE. The predominant attribution was to a physical event. There were no significant differences neither in the health measures across causal attribution status (Pillai's Trace = 0.193; F(8,90) = 1.200; p = .308; η2 par = .096) nor in the PTLE not in childhood (F(2,47) = 1.063; p = .354; η2 par = .043). There were significant differences across causal attribution status in the PTLE in childhood (F(2,47) = 3.590; p = .035; η2 par = .133), specifically between the group that made a psychological attribution and the group that made no attribution (C.I. 95%) 0.1805; 14.0468; (p = .043), with the former having a higher score of PTLE in childhood. The results raise questions about the importance of psychological aspects in the appraisal of the adverse events and its possible relation to the psychological functioning in women with fibromyalgia.},

Abstract = {Dental materials are perceived as a health problem by some people, although scientists do not agree about possible causes of such problems. The aim of this paper was to gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of experiences from living with health problems attributed to dental materials. Addressed topics were the type of problem, both as to general and oral health, perceived causes of the problems,their experienced effect on life, and reception by health professionals. Persons, who in a previous large questionnaire study had answered that they had experienced troubles from dental materials and also agreed to answer follow-up questions, were contacted with a request to take part in an interview study. Eleven individual interviews were held.The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the material was analysed according to the Qualitative Content Analysis method. Meaning units were extracted and condensed into a number of codes, which were combined into subcategories, categories, and themes. Four themes were identified: 1) Long-term oral, mental, and somatic difficulties of varying character, caused by dental amalgam. 2) Problems treated mainly by replacement of dental material in fillings. 3) Powerful effects on life, mostly negative. 4) The reception by health professionals was generally good, but with elements of encounters where they felt treated with nonchalance and lack of respect. In conclusion, people who attributed their health difficulties to dental materials had a complex range of problems and the perception was that amalgam/mercury was the cause of the troubles. The reception from health professionals was perceived as generally good, although with occasional negative experiences.},

Abstract = {The idea that bad things happen and can drive you crazy is not controversial to the public, including people diagnosed 'schizophrenic' and their relatives. Studies spanning 60 years show that while the public understands that many factors influence our mental health, they place far more emphasis on adverse life events than on biology or genetics. This belief has survived concerted efforts by biological psychiatry and drug companies to persuade us we are wrong. There has been insufficient research into the causal beliefs of staff. The public has an equally strong preference for psychosocial solutions over medical interventions for 'schizophrenia'. A 2006 review found that 'the public's beliefs about psychological interventions are predominantly favorable, while very negative views prevail about pharmacological treatments. Surprisingly, they also found that the particular liking of psychotherapy is more developed for schizophrenia than for depression. Even in the United States the public values talk to family/friends, therapist and self-help group as much as prescription medication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Humans are essentially social animals. To navigate in social environments efficiently, people have to think about themselves and others frequently and to understand themselves and others correctly. The processing of social information about oneself and others, referred to as social cognition, provides a basis for appropriate social behaviors and an avenue to achieve social goals. An important feature of social cognition is context dependence—that is, what and how social information is processed relies heavily on whom an individual interacts with and in which social context such interactions occur. Based on cross-cultural comparisons, psychological findings have formulated several variations of standard social cognitive processes in different cultural contexts, such as causal attribution, self-construals, and affect valuation. Cross-cultural variation in social cognition may reflect, to a certain degree, the difference in cognitive styles between different cultures. This chapter reviews previous psychological findings of cross-cultural variations in social cognition and recent brain imaging findings of cross-cultural variations in the neural substrates underlying social cognition. This literature review outlines what aspects of social cognition vary across cultures and to what degree the underlying neural mechanisms are shaped by sociocultural contexts. This chapter will also discuss the implications, of transcultural imaging findings for mental health and raise future questions regarding the cultural diversity of social cognitive processes and their underlying neural mechanisms.

Abstract = {Background: The lay public across different cultures hold highly variable beliefs regarding the cause of different psychiatric disorders. In developing countries, a vast majority of people attributed psychiatric symptoms to supernatural phenomena, drug use, stressful life events, heredity or personality deficiencies and accordingly sought treatment from various avenues. Methods: One hundred twenty consecutive consenting patients accompanied by a reliable informant/family member fulfilling the ICD-10 criteria of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders, mood disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, somatization and dissociative disorders were included in the study. Sociodemographic and clinical proforma of all the eligible subjects was filled in. Perceived causes of illness and help seeking pattern were explored from the informant by administering proper instrument. Results: Respondents identified a mean of 2.78 (± 0.87 SD) causes of psychiatric disorders in their relatives and explored a mean of 2.8 (± 1.51 SD) help seeking options before reaching tertiary care center. The majority (96.8%) of the relatives of patients’ with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders believed in supernatural causation whereas, majority of the relatives of subjects with depressive disorder (34.6%), OCD and other anxiety disorders (80%), somatization or dissociative disorders (61.5%) attributed their relatives’ symptom to excessive worrying/thinking. Majority of the subjects across all four diagnostic categories sought non-professional medical help. Preference for religious remedies (54.8% of subjects with schizophrenia and 100% of subjects with OCD-anxiety disorders) and alternative medicine (80% of the subjects with OCD-anxiety disorders) were also noticed. Across all four diagnostic categories belief in causes other than bodily pathology predicted help seeking from various quarters except for professional medical help whereas symptom attribution to bodily pathology predicted professional help seeking in OCD-anxiety disorder group. In the schizophrenia group, people who believed in psychological causation were more likely to be from higher income group; whereas those who sought professional medical help were more likely to be educated. Conclusion: A wide variety of indigenous beliefs exist in Indo-Pak subcontinent which is in conflict with biomedical models of these psychiatric disorders. Such beliefs result in non-professional medical help seeking which could be detrimental to the health of patients suffering from these psychiatric disorders.

This study compared illness perceptions about depression and the help-seeking behaviour of white British (n = 70) and North Indian women (n = 70) living in the UK. Previous studies have used interviews to elicit illness perceptions but have been time-consuming. The shorter Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) was used instead. A cross-sectional survey design was used. Participants were asked to evaluate problems of a vignette character using the BIPQ. Compared with the British group, Indian participants believed treatment would be less beneficial; felt they had less of an understanding of the character's difficulties and that the character's difficulties had less of an effect on her emotionally. Significantly fewer of the Indian sample suggested the character should go to her general practitioner (GP). Consistent with previous findings, Indian women reported themselves t)},

Abstract = {Background: Depression in primary care is common, yet this costly and disabling condition remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Persisting gaps in the primary care of depression are due in part to patients' reluctance to bring depressive symptoms to the attention of their primary care clinician and, when depression is diagnosed, to accept initial treatment for the condition. Both targeted and tailored communication strategies offer promise for fomenting discussion and reducing barriers to appropriate initial treatment of depression.; Methods/design: The Activating Messages to Enhance Primary Care Practice (AMEP2) Study is a stratified randomized controlled trial comparing two computerized multimedia patient interventions -- one targeted (to patient gender and income level) and one tailored (to level of depressive symptoms, visit agenda, treatment preferences, depression causal attributions, communication self-efficacy and stigma)-- and an attention control. AMEP2 consists of two linked sub-studies, one focusing on patients with significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] scores ≥ 5), the other on patients with few or no depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 5). The first sub-study examined effectiveness of the interventions; key outcomes included delivery of components of initial depression care (antidepressant prescription or mental health referral). The second sub-study tracked potential hazards (clinical distraction and overtreatment). A telephone interview screening procedure assessed patients for eligibility and oversampled patients with significant depressive symptoms. Sampled, consenting patients used computers to answer survey questions, be randomized, and view assigned interventions just before scheduled primary care office visits. Patient surveys were also collected immediately post-visit and 12 weeks later. Physicians completed brief reporting forms after each patient's index visit. Additional data were obtained from medical record abstraction and visit audio recordings. Of 6,191 patients assessed, 867 were randomized and included in analysis, with 559 in the first sub-study and 308 in the second.; Discussion: Based on formative research, we developed two novel multimedia programs for encouraging patients to discuss depressive symptoms with their primary care clinicians. Our computer-based enrollment and randomization procedures ensured that randomization was fully concealed and data missingness minimized. Analyses will focus on the interventions' potential benefits among depressed persons, and the potential hazards among the non-depressed.; Trial Registration: ClinicialTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01144104.},

Abstract = {Background: Previous studies have shown that attitudes towards depression may be influenced by country-specific social and cultural factors. A survey was carried out to collect beliefs on and attitudes toward depression in Italy, which has an established community-based mental health system. Methods: A telephone survey was carried out in a probabilistic sample aged ≥15 years. A 20-item questionnaire was administered to explore knowledge of depression, stigma, causal beliefs, treatment preference, and help-seeking attitudes. Results: Of the 1001 participants, 98% were aware of depression, and 62% had experienced it, either directly or indirectly. A widespread belief (75%) was that people suffering from depression should avoid talking about their problem. A minority of the sample viewed depression as a condition that should be managed without recourse to external help or a 'socially dangerous' illness. Among perceived causes of depression, most respondents mentioned life stressors or physical strains. Psychologists were often indicated as an adequate source of professional help. Half of the sample believed that depression should be pharmacologically treated, but drugs were often seen as addictive. Referring to a primary care physician (PCP) was considered embarrassing; furthermore, many people thought that PCPs are too busy to treat patients suffering from depression. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that depression is seen as a reaction to significant life events that should be overcome with the support of significant others or the help of health professionals (mainly psychologists). However, there are still barriers to the disclosure of depressive symptoms to PCPs, and concerns about the addictive effect of antidepressants. In the presence of a gap between people’s beliefs and what health professionals consider appropriate for the treatment of depression, a 'shared decision making' approach to treatment selection should be adopted taking into account the patients’ preference for psychological interventions to ensure active compliance with effective treatments.

We excluded patients with mental retardation or neurological diseases. For family members, we excluded participants with a history of mental disorders or cognitive impairments. We collected basic socio-demographic data for both patients and relatives. We asked relatives to respond by "yes/no/I am not certain" to a three-part questionnaire including 27 items dealing with causal explanations, symptoms and optimal cures for schizophrenia.; Results: The mean age of the relatives was 49.8 (±13.7) years; 54.9% were men; 49.4% were parents, 8.8% spouses, 39.6% brothers or sisters; 25.3% had not attended school, 24.2% had attended primary school, 37.4% junior high school or high school and 13.2% had a university degree; 63.7% lived in an urban area; 33% had low economic status and 41.8% reported having another family member with mental disorder.

Among the cited etiologies of schizophrenia, religious causes were found in 76.9% of cases, they first cited God's will or fate and secondly God's punishment. Magical explanations such as witchcraft and possession by "djinns" were found in 47.3% of cases. The biological causes were cited by 59.3% of participants. The majority of participants (95.6%) proved the need for drugs and 81.3% the utility of psychotherapies. However, 30.8% believed in non-medical practices such as reading Holy Koran verses, charity and exorcism. Significant correlations were found between relatives' low level of education, low economic status, living in a rural area and supernatural beliefs, traditional practices, stigma and the use of the term 'madness'. Significant correlations were also found between family history of mental disorders and beliefs on family and hereditary causes.; Conclusion: In this study, opinions and attitudes regarding schizophrenia were related to education level, economic status and geographic origin.

Abstract = {Background: Depressive and pain symptoms often occur concurrently in patients with psychiatric disorders or somatic diseases, but the contribution of pre-existing dysfunctional cognitive schemata to pain perception remains unclear. Objective: To investigate the relationship between depression-related attribution styles and perceived pain intensity (PPI) after controllable versus uncontrollable electrical skin stimulation in healthy male individuals. Methods: Causal attributions for negative events were measured using the attribution style questionnaire (ASQ) on the dimensions internal versus external (INT), global versus specific (GLO) and stable versus unstable (STA) in 50 men (20 to 31 years of age). Additionally, symptoms of anxiety and depression (measured using the Depression Scale) as well as baseline helplessness were assessed. Participants were randomly assigned to receive self-administered (controllable) or experimenter-administered (uncontrollable) painful skin stimuli. PPI was assessed after stress exposure using a visual analogue scale (0 to 100). Relationships between PPI and depression-related cognitions were calculated using correlation and multiple regression analyses. Results: Correlation analyses revealed a moderate correlation between PPI and ASQ-1NT scores (r=0.46). Following uncontrollable stress exposure, significantly higher PPI ratings (P=0.001) and a higher correlation between PPI and ASQ-INT (r=0.70) were observed. Multiple regression analysis showed an independent influence of stressor controllability (β=0.39; P=0.003) and ASQ-INT (β=0.36; P=0.006) on PPI. Discussion: These findings highlight the interaction of specific depression-related cognitions and stress controllability on pain intensity perception. Conclusions: The results of the present study may facilitate understanding of the cognitive aspects of pain intensity perception and improve psychological pain therapies focusing on attributions and controllability.

Abstract = {Mental health service providers and researchers usually explain psychological/behavioral problems in terms of risk and protective factors. Although such an approach may seem empirical, and thus accurate, the manner in which patients interpret these factors is often overlooked. The result is that practitioners and researchers draw conclusions and make possible causal attributions that do not take into account the perspective of those who are studied or in care. Storylines, however, are a promising strategy to understanding mental health problems that is sensitive to the experiences and situations of people, and can bring into view more relevant details of patients’ lives. This paper provides a theoretically grounded justification for the use of storylines in both mental health practice and research. Storylines are defined, while suggestions are provided for how this framework might be put into practice. A discussion is offered on how storylines might improve the design and implementation of health interventions by requiring these services to become more attuned to the lived experience of patients and the meanings they attach to common risk factors.

Abstract = {Background: Depression and weight change are linked, but there is a paucity of studies on their association during clinical treatment. The present study investigated how risk factors for a weight gain of at least 10% (major weight gain) and mental health modify their mutual association during a 6-year prospective follow-up of depressed outpatients. Method: The study sample consisted of 121 depressed treatment-seeking outpatients with a mean age of 44.9 years. A 6-year follow-up started in January 1996. At baseline and on follow-up after 2 and 6years, psychiatric diagnoses were obtained using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-I), while cluster C personality disorders (PD) were assessed on 6-month follow-up (SCID-II). Depression was also assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and general psychopathology with the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) at baseline and at the end of the 6-year follow-up. Weight changes were based on measurements at baseline and at the end of the follow-up. Logistic regression was used to study the factors associated with major weight gain (≥ 10%). Results: Altogether, 16% of the study sample experienced major weight gain during the 6-year follow-up. Adverse childhood/adolescent experiences as a self-perceived cause of depression (OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.06–13.1, p = 0.040), higher scores in the HAM-D (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02–1.22, p = 0.019) and the SCL-90 subscale of anxiety (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.11–4.42, p = 0.023) at baseline, and cluster C PD at 6months (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.11–8.97, p = 0.031) were separately associated with major weight gain after adjusting for age, gender, and baseline body mass index (BMI). Conclusion: The severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and linking adverse childhood with depression at the beginning of treatment, as well as cluster C PD at 6months, were predictors of major weight gain.

Abstract = {Objective: Guided by Weiner’s attribution theory (1985), the aim of this study is to describe the reasons given by people with psychiatric disabilities to explain job loss. Methods: Using a sample of 126 people with psychiatric disabilities participating in a prospective study design, the authors evaluated the causal attributions pattern to explain job loss. During a 9-month follow-up phone interview, clients of supported employment programs were asked to explain the reasons why they had lost their jobs. The reasons provided were categorized according to type of job loss (voluntarily vs. involuntarily), locus of control (external vs. internal) and controllability (controllable vs. uncontrollable). Results: The results show that 73% of participants had voluntarily ended their jobs. For the majority of participants, the reasons given to explain job loss were related to external and uncontrollable factors. Moreover, men used more external (34.1% vs. 23%) and uncontrollable (68.2% vs. 40%) reasons than women. Severity of symptoms and level of education also affected the attributional pattern. However, self-esteem, psychiatric diagnosis and work centrality did not correlate significantly to the attributional pattern. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: The results demonstrated that reasons given to explain job loss among people with psychiatric disabilities are mostly external. A more systematic evaluation of environmental factors should be put in place to favor longer job tenure for people with psychiatric disabilities.

Abstract = {Although somatization is common across cultures, its meanings may differ as culture shapes emotional experience. Thus, instead of treating somatization as a form of psychopathology, it is more useful to conceptualize it as an idiom of distress, and how complaints of somatic symptoms are related to social relationships, patterns of emotional expression and symptom attribution in a cultural context. This study seeks to explore whether ambivalence over emotional expression and causal attribution would shed light on the meanings of somatization among Asian adolescents. Three hundred secondary school adolescents in Singapore participated in this study. The main results show that emotional ambivalence, biomedical and Traditional Chinese Medicinal causal beliefs, and magical attribution contributed to additional variance in somatic symptoms over and above the variance explained by emotional distress. These findings are discussed from both psychological and cultural perspectives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Biological conceptualisations of depression are increasingly prevalent. The current study aimed to investigate the current prevalence of causal beliefs about depression in the Australian public, the factors associated with these beliefs, and changes over time. Method: A nationally representative sample of Australian adults was surveyed as part of the 2011 National Mental Health Literacy and Stigma Survey. Beliefs about the causes of depression were assessed based on responses to vignettes depicting a person with either depression (n = 893) or depression with suicidal thoughts (n = 903). Socio-demographic characteristics, personal and professional experience with depression, and correct recognition of depression were investigated as predictors of causal beliefs about depression using binary logistic regression. Comparisons were made between the Australian public's current causal beliefs and data obtained in national surveys conducted in 1995 and 2003/4. Results: Over 80% of the Australian public attributed depression to day to day problems, death of a close friend or relative, a recent traumatic event, childhood problems, and a chemical imbalance in the brain. People who correctly labelled the disorder in the vignettes were more likely to attribute depression to psychosocial reasons and less likely to attribute it to an allergic reaction, a virus, or an infection. Belief in psychosocial and genetic causes has increased over time, whereas belief in infection, allergy and weakness of character has decreased. Limitations: Comparisons between the 1995, 2003/4 and 2011 surveys were limited by the differences in the survey methodology at each time point, and by low response rates to the 2003/4 and 2011 surveys. The survey design prevented insight into the reasoning underlying individuals' responses, and lacked sufficient power to explore the beliefs of Australians from cultural minorities. Conclusions: The majority of the Australian public believe that both psychosocial and biological factors cause depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study contrasts the medicalized conceptualization of mental illness with psychologizing mental illness and examines what the consequences are of adhering to one model versus the other for help seeking and stigma. Methods: The survey 'Stigma in a Global Context–Belgian Mental Health Study' (2009) conducted face-to-face interviews among a representative sample of the general Belgian population using the vignette technique to depict schizophrenia (N = 381). Causal attributions, labeling processes, and the disease view are addressed. Help seeking refers to open-ended help-seeking suggestions (general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist, family, friends, and self-care options). Stigma refers to social exclusion after treatment. The data are analyzed by means of logistic and linear regression models in SPSS Statistics 19. Results: People who adhere to the biopsychosocial (versus psychosocial) model are more likely to recommend general medical care and people who apply the disease view are more likely to recommend specialized medical care. Regarding informal help, those who prefer the biopsychosocial model are less likely to recommend consulting friends than those who adhere to the psychosocial model. Respondents who apply a medical compared to a nonmedical label are less inclined to recommend self-care. As concerns treatment stigma, respondents who apply a medical instead of a non-medical label are more likely to socially exclude someone who has been in psychiatric treatment. Conclusions: Medicalizing mental illness involves a package deal: biopsychosocial causal attributions and applying the disease view facilitate medical treatment recommendations, while labeling seems to trigger stigmatizing attitudes.

Abstract = {Purpose: It has been assumed that biogenetic causal models may improve public attitudes toward people with mental illnesses. The present study examines whether biogenetic attributions are positively associated with acceptance of people suffering from these disorders. Methods: Population surveys were conducted in two large German cities. Respondents were presented with a vignette depicting a young female suffering from either anorexia nervosa (N = 680) or bulimia nervosa (N = 667), followed by a fully structured interview including questions on causal attributions, emotional reactions and desire for social distance. Results: Attribution to hereditary factors showed hardly any relationship with attitudes toward people with symptoms of eating disorders. Respondents who endorsed brain disease as a cause tended more to hold those afflicted responsible for their condition, they also expressed more negative emotions and a stronger preference for social distance. Conclusions: Our results do not support the notion that promulgating biogenetic causal models of eating disorders helps decrease the stigma surrounding these illnesses; it may even entail the risk of increasing it.

Abstract = {A Many-Facet Rasch analysis was carried out with the intent of identifying a latent trait dimension characterized by mental disorders causal beliefs variables. The present research consists of two studies. In Study 1, the responses of 443 Italian university students to a 40-item scale were analyzed by means of Rasch models. In Study 2, the responses of two new groups of subjects, of 300 and 135 people respectively, were examined to further validate the mental disorders causal beliefs dimension obtained in Study 1. Specific bias/interactions between the MDCB dimension and other variables, such as gender and university faculties, were detected. Correlation analyses between the MDCB dimension and attribution theory and social desirability variables were also carried out. The results showed that a 30-item Mental Disorder Causal Beliefs (MDCB) latent dimension exists, characterized by contents representative of biological-genetic and psychosocial causes. Males and females did not differ on their causal beliefs, whereas Psychology students presented more psycho-social etiology beliefs. The MDCB dimension was correlated neither to a general locus of control scale nor to the social desirability measure, whereas it was significantly correlated to the psychotherapeutic attribution measure. The results evidenced a well devised measure which can be potentially useful in the research and clinical practice for the assessment of people’s etiology beliefs about mental illness, focusing on the development of personalized interventions to reduce or modify eventual negative attitudes and misconceptions.

Abstract = {Background: Public understanding about mental illnesses and attitudes towards people with mental illness (PWMI) play a paramount role in the prevention and treatment of mental illness and the rehabilitation of PWMI. The aim of this study was to measure public stigma against PWMI and the factors associated with stigma in the Gilgel Gibe Field Research Center (GGFRC) in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: This community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2012 among 845 randomly selected respondents by using the Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI) scale, an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data was entered with EPI-DATA and then exported to STATA for analysis. Simple descriptive and linear regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of stigma against PWMI. Results: Of the total of 845 respondents, 68.17% were from rural districts. The mean stigma score was 2.62 on a 5-point score. The majority of the respondents (75.27%) believed that mental illness can be cured. Stress, poverty, and rumination were the most often perceived causes of mental illness. Rural residents had significantly higher stigma scores (std. β = 0.61, P < 0.001). A statistically significant inverse relationship was found between the level of education and degree of stigma (std. β = −0.14, P < 0.01), while higher income was significantly associated with more stigma (std. β = 0.07, P < 0.05). Respondents with higher scores for perceived supernatural causes (std. β = −0.09, P < 0.01) and perceived psychosocial and biological causes (std. β = −0.14, P < 0.001) had significantly lower stigma levels. Conclusions: The study found a more undermining but less avoidant attitude towards PWMI. Rural residents showed higher levels of stigma. Stigma against PWMI was lower in people with an explanatory concept about the causes of mental illness and a higher level of education. Information, education, and communication about the causes, signs, and nature of mental illnesses would help to reduce stigma. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Although nonadherence to antipsychotic medication poses a threat to outcome of medical treatment, the processes preceding the intake behavior have not been investigated sufficiently. This study tests a process model of medication adherence derived from the Health Belief Model which is based on cost-benefit considerations. The model includes an extensive set of potential predictors for medication attitudes and uses these attitudes as a predictor for medication adherence. We conducted an online study of 84 participants with a self-reported psychotic disorder and performed a path analysis. More insight into the need for treatment, a higher attribution of the symptoms to a mental disorder, experience of less negative side effects, presence of biological causal beliefs, and less endorsement of psychological causal beliefs were significant predictors of more positive attitudes towards medication. The results largely supported the postulated process model. Mental health professionals should consider attitudes towards medication and the identified predictors when they address adherence problems with the patient in a shared and informed decision process.},

Abstract = {Background: There is an ongoing debate whether biological illness explanations improve tolerance towards persons with mental illness or not. Several theoretical models have been proposed to predict the relationship between causal beliefs and social acceptance. This study uses path models to compare different theoretical predictions regarding attitudes towards persons with schizophrenia, depression and alcohol dependence. Method: In a representative population survey in Germany (n = 3642), we elicited agreement with belief in biogenetic causes, current stress and childhood adversities as causes of either disorder as described in an unlabelled case vignette. We further elicited potentially mediating attitudes related to different theories about the consequences of biogenetic causal beliefs (attribution theory: onset responsibility, offset responsibility; genetic essentialism: differentness, dangerousness; genetic optimism: treatability) and social acceptance. For each vignette condition, we calculated a multiple mediator path model containing all variables. Results: Biogenetic beliefs were associated with lower social acceptance in schizophrenia and depression, and with higher acceptance in alcohol dependence. In schizophrenia and depression, perceived differentness and dangerousness mediated the largest indirect effects, the consequences of biogenetic causal explanations thus being in accordance with the predictions of genetic essentialism. Psychosocial causal beliefs had differential effects: belief in current stress as a cause was associated with higher acceptance in schizophrenia, while belief in childhood adversities resulted in lower acceptance of a person with depression. Conclusions: Biological causal explanations seem beneficial in alcohol dependence, but harmful in schizophrenia and depression. The negative correlates of believing in childhood adversities as a cause of depression merit further exploration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A core competency of counselors is to embrace client diversity and practice in a culturally appropriate manner. It is important to recognize clients' unique cultural contexts and the resulting 'lens' in which they view the world. This shared 'lens' of perception includes how people define illness, including mental health disorders and the perceived causes, as well as the accepted modalities of treatments. This is true with individuals from various religious cultures. Religion can be a potent web of influence and can create shared meanings that shape worldviews. This is true of Pentecostals who espouse a specific worldview that lends itself to a unique cultural lens of understanding mental health disorders. Their worldview is complex, and embraces the natural realm while highly valuing the spiritual realm. They believe that the Holy Spirit is an active integral part of their lives. As such, they believe that divine healing from illness is attainable if God wills it so. These beliefs in the supernatural, as well as ways they are lived out, are important to consider when discussing views regarding their beliefs regarding causes and treatments of mental health disorders. They also highly value the role of the clergy and often turn to them for help with mental health problems. The goal of this study was to explore the Apostolic Pentecostal clergy's beliefs regarding mental health disorders within the context of their unique spiritual worldview. Seven Apostolic Pentecostal clergy were interviewed via a semi-structured telephone interview. The results found that Apostolic Pentecostal clergy viewed biological and psychosocial determinants as causes of mental health disorders.They endorsed professional counseling and medication with concurrent pastoral care to address the whole person. Treatment was viewed in the context of healing. They believed that God could heal any problem instantly, or in a gradual healing process that incorporates the clergy and counselors working together with the help of the Holy Spirit. The clergy saw their role as providing spiritual care while supporting parishioners as they received concurrent mental health care. Clergy embraced collaboration with counselors, with a preference for counselors who believed in God. Clergy reported that negating the importance of the spiritual realm or going against their faith-based practices would create problems for them, as well as their parishioners. Clergy indicated that it was important for counselors to know that Apostolic Pentecostals operate within a strong faith-based worldview. In addition, they wanted counselors to know that they embrace education and outside help in addition to the working of the Holy Spirit and pastoral care in treating mental health disorders. However, their parishioners may have difficulty asking for help based on past teaching that asserted that if one had God's Spirit, they would not need outside help. The results indicate that the Apostolic Pentecostal clergy held shared beliefs regarding causes and treatments of mental health disorders, as well as those they trusted to address these issues. In addition, the results display significant differences from past research with Pentecostals. Implications for counseling and future research are discussed.

Abstract = {The study explores lay conceptualizations of mental illness among the Akans of Ghana as influenced by their cultural worldview. Akan, the largest ethnic group in Ghana, is noted for the use of supernatural attributions for various health-related issues. The supernatural attributions are based on Akan ontological belief that the universe is unitary such that there is no clear distinction between physical and spiritual occurrences. This worldview guides Akans in how they deal with a wide range of issues including their mental health. Clinicians and other mental health professionals who rely solely on biomedical approaches to mental health fail to meet the demands of Akan mental health help-seekers because such approaches do not recognize the cultural factors that inform lay understandings on mental illness. Limited studies have been conducted on how Akan supernatural attributions influence conceptualizations of mental illness. Using a grounded theory method of research, 14 individual interviews and 7 focus group interviews were conducted to explore beliefs and knowledge about mental illness in two indigenous Akan communities in Ghana. Participants were of diverse age, sex, education, and occupational background. Analysis revealed that cultural factors influence lay conceptions, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. Local labels for mental illness as well as beliefs about etiology, development, and cure of mental illness were identified. It was found that the Akan unitary worldview aids in the endorsement of heterogeneous multi-tier causal attributions of mental illness that embrace supernatural and non-supernatural causal explanations. Although supernatural causality theories of mental illness existed, participants related a complex causal explanation that involved other non-supernatural causal attributions. Results further revealed that Akan cultural beliefs influence community response to mental illness, encouraging pluralistic help-seeking behaviors that satisfy the Akan cultural value for holistic treatment and care. The implications of the findings for clinical training, culturally-sensitive mental health practice, and mental health education and advocacy have been discussed.

Abstract = {Background: The impact of staff and service user gender on responses of staff in intellectual disability (ID) services is poorly understood. The present study set out to assess the role of gender in influencing staff emotions, attributions and behavioural intentions in response to aggression displayed by adults with ID. Method: A new scale measuring staff behavioural intentions was developed. A two × two (staff gender × service user gender) between subjects design was used to compare the responses of day and residential support staff to physical aggression by a hypothetical service user. In response to a vignette depicting a service user with ID assaulting a member of staff, 160 respondents completed measures of affective responses, causal attributions and behavioural intentions while imagining themselves as the target of the service user’s assault. Results: Female participants reported feeling more fear/anxiety, more depression/anger and less confident/relaxed than male participants. The longer staff had worked with people with ID, the more likely they were to favour safety-focused behaviours. More confident female participants were less likely to favour safety-focused behaviours, but confidence had no effect on male participants’ endorsement of these behaviours. Increased confidence in both was associated with lower agreement of safety-focused behaviours in relation to the female vignette, regardless of participant gender. The more control women believed the service user had over their behaviour, the more likely they were to choose safety-focused behaviours. Punitive behaviours were favoured more in response to the male rather than the female service user. Punitive behaviours were also favoured more by more junior staff and by participants who expected feeling more depressed/angry in response to the vignettes. Conclusions: Both staff and service user gender influenced staff responses to aggression, yet the latter played a smaller role than expected. The role of gender in staff–service user interactions should be the focus of further research and should be considered in service delivery.

Abstract = {Background: Gay men are at higher risk of suffering from a variety of psychiatric disorders, yet the mental health literacy of this population has remained largely unknown. Methods: In 2007 and 2011, surveys were conducted among gay men in Geneva, Switzerland, recruited by probability-based time-space sampling. Based on a case vignette of a man with major depression, respondents were asked a series of questions about labelling, perceived risk, and help-seeking beliefs. Men meeting caseness for major depression were asked open questions about perceived causes and additional help-seeking/self-help. Results: Among the 762 respondents, 14.7% met diagnostic criteria for major depression (MDD) in the past 12 months. The vignette was labelled depression by 44.1% of the entire sample, and 61.9% of the men with MDD. Discrimination (33.2%), acceptance or rejection by others (21.4%), and loneliness (24.9%) were the most common reasons given for greater susceptibility among gay men, yet men with MDD reported problems with love/relationship (32.5%) and work (28.9%) as the most common perceived causes of recent depression, and problems with love/relationship (21.9%), accepting one's homosexuality (21.1%), and family (20.2%) at initial outset. The highest proportions of gay men rated non-medical options such as a close friend (91.6%), relaxation exercises or meditation (84.4%), and physical activity (83.5%) as being helpful for the depression vignette. Limitations: No probes used for open questions, and findings generalizable only to gay men in the sampling scheme. Conclusions: There are many commonalities in labelling, perceived causes, and help-seeking with general populations, but also numerous specificities in mental health literacy and experience among gay men.

Abstract = {Fewer than half of Asian Americans prescribed psychotropic medication actually adhere to their medications. Poor psychotropic medication adherence among Asian Americans might be influenced by cultural beliefs about medication, mental illness, and stigma surrounding mental disorders, but the data are limited. Studies in Asian populations, whose belief systems are shared by many Asian American groups, may help broaden our understanding of medication adherence in Asian Americans. The purpose of this article is to synthesize existing research on interventions that might contribute to improved adherence to psychotropic medication among psychiatric patients of Asian descent. Searches of PubMed and PsycINFO for relevant articles published between 1960 and October 2010 yielded 1,520 potentially relevant studies. Nine intervention studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Most successful interventions used variations on psychoeducation that included both patients and family caregivers. Even in the absence of significant changes to adherence, patients often showed clinical improvement. Improvements in knowledge and attitude among patients and family caregivers coincided with clinical improvement. Findings highlight the effects of caregiver and patient causal beliefs on adherence outcome. Implications for adherence to psychotropic medication interventions among Asian Americans are discussed.

Abstract = {Research has identified numerous mechanisms through which perceived social isolation and lack of social support negatively impact health. Little research attention has been dedicated to factors that influence the development of social networks, which have the potential to decrease perceptions of social isolation and provide social support. There is mixed evidence concerning the availability of supportive social networks for Latinos in the US. This study explores trauma-exposed Latin immigrants’ experiences of social isolation in the US and its perceived causes. Twenty-eight Latina immigrant women participated in an interview about traumatic experiences. Informal help seeking and the availability of friendships in the US were also queried. Frequent comparisons between experiences in their home countries and in the US shaped the emerging themes of social isolation and lack of social support. Women reported feeling lonely, isolated, closedin, and less free in the US due to family separation and various obstacles to developing and maintaining relationships. Socioeconomic, environmental, and psychosocial barriers were offered as explanations for their limited social networks in the US. Understanding experiences of social isolation as well as barriers to forging social networks can help inform the development of social support interventions that can contribute to improved health among Latinos.

Abstract = {The present study applied the common sense model (i.e., cause, controllability, timeline, consequences, and illness coherence) to understand public attitudes toward mental illness and help-seeking intention and to examine the mediating role of perceived controllability between causal attributions with public attitudes and help seeking. Based on a randomized household sample of 941 Chinese community adults in Hong Kong, results of the structural equation modeling demonstrated that people who endorsed cultural lay beliefs tended to perceive the course of mental illness as less controllable, whereas those with psychosocial attributions see its course as more controllable. The more people perceived the course of mental illness as less controllable, more chronic, and incomprehensible, the lower was their acceptance and the greater was mental illness stigma. Furthermore, those who perceived mental illness with dire consequences were more likely to feel greater stigma and social distance. Conversely, when people were more accepting, they were more likely to seek help for psychological services and felt a shorter social distance. The common sense model provides a multidimensional framework in understanding public’s mental illness perceptions and stigma. Not only should biopsychosocial determinants of mental illness be advocated to the public, cultural myths toward mental illness must be debunked.

Abstract = {Background: There is a large burden of psychological distress in low and middle-income countries, and culturally relevant interventions must be developed to address it. This requires an understanding of how distress is experienced. We conducted a qualitative grounded theory study to understand how mothers experience and manage distress in Dhanusha, a low-resource setting in rural Nepal. We also explored how distressed mothers interact with their families and the wider community. Methods: Participants were identified during a cluster-randomised controlled trial in which mothers were screened for psychological distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with distressed mothers (GHQ-12 score ≥ 5) and one with a traditional healer (dhami), as well as 12 focus group discussions with community members. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods and a model was developed to explain psychological distress in this setting. Results: We found that distress was termed tension by participants and mainly described in terms of physical symptoms. Key perceived causes of distress were poor health, lack of sons, and fertility problems. Tension developed in a context of limited autonomy for women and perceived duty towards the family. Distressed mothers discussed several strategies to alleviate tension, including seeking treatment for perceived physical health problems and tension from doctors or dhamis, having repeated pregnancies until a son was delivered, manipulating social circumstances in the household, and deciding to accept their fate. Their ability to implement these strategies depended on whether they were able to negotiate with their in-laws or husbands for resources. Conclusions: Vulnerability, as a consequence of gender and social disadvantage, manifests as psychological distress among mothers in Dhanusha. Screening tools incorporating physical symptoms of tension should be envisaged, along with interventions to address gender inequity, support marital relationships, and improve access to perinatal healthcare.

Abstract = {Many anti-stigma campaigns emphasize biogenetic causes to convey that schizophrenia is an 'illness like others'. A growing body of studies shows that although biogenetic explanations reduce blame, they tend to reinforce prognostic pessimism and harsher treatment of people with schizophrenia. In contrast, psychosocial explanations attenuate prognostic pessimism and perceived otherness, but seem less suitable to reduce blame. We hypothesized that a vulnerability-stress model that combines biogenetic and psychosocial explanations would yield clearer stigma-reducing effects than the mono-causal models. In an online-experiment, 416 participants from the general population randomly received either a vulnerability-stress, biogenetic, psychosocial or control-intervention, which consisted of information text and video presentation of a case-example. Causal beliefs, stereotypes and desired social distance were assessed by self-report. Baseline causal beliefs were weakly associated with stereotypes. The vulnerability-stress intervention did not reduce stigma more effectively than the biogenetic or psychosocial intervention and was less effective in reducing perceived blame than the biogenetic intervention. Compared to the control-intervention, no intervention showed significant stigma-reducing effects, but the psychosocial and vulnerability-stress conditions both increased blame. We found no evidence for vulnerability-stress explanations as a mean to reduce stigma. We propose further research to identify more effective ways to tackle stigma.

Abstract = {Objective: Paramedic fatigue is associated with burnout, attrition, sick leave, work disability, physical and mental health complaints and impaired performance. However, no studies have addressed how fatigue is understood by paramedics. The present study addresses this shortcoming by exploring factors paramedics recognise as contributors to fatigue.; Methods: Forty-nine (12F; 38 years ± 9.7 years) Australian paramedics completed a survey on perceived causes of performance impairing fatigue. A total of 107 responses were systematically coded following principles common to qualitative data analysis: data immersion, coding, categorisation and theme generation.; Results: Six themes emerged: working time, sleep, workload, health and well-being, work-life balance and environment. Consistent with a scientific understanding of fatigue, prior sleep and wake, time of day and task-related factors were often identified as contributing to fatigue. In other cases, paramedics' attributions deviated from a scientific understanding of direct causes of fatigue.; Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that paramedics have a broad understanding of fatigue. It is critical to take this into account when discussing fatigue with paramedics, particularly in the case of fatigue education or wellness programmes. These data highlight areas for intervention and education to minimise the experience of paramedic fatigue and the negative health and safety outcomes for paramedics and patients as a result.

Abstract = {Background: Understanding of mental illness in sub-Saharan Africa has remained under-researched in spite of the high and increasing neuropsychiatric burden of disease in the region. Aims: This study investigated the causal beliefs that the Igbo people of south-eastern Nigeria hold about schizophrenia, with a view to establishing the extent to which the population makes psychosocial, biological and supernatural attributions. Method: Multi-stage sampling was used to select participants (N = 200) to which questionnaires were administered. Results: Mean comparison of the three causal models revealed a significant endorsement of supernatural causation. Logistic regressions revealed significant contributions of old age and female gender to supernatural attribution; old age, high education and Catholic religious denomination to psychosocial attributions; and high education to biological attributions. Conclusions: It is hoped that the findings would enlighten, augment literature and enhance mental health care service delivery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated differences in mental health knowledge and beliefs between participants from the Iraqi and Sudanese refugee communities, and Australian-born individuals, in Sydney, Australia. Methods: Ninety-seven participants were given vignettes of characters describing symptoms of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress. They were required to identify psychological symptoms as disorders, rate beliefs about the causes of and helpful treatments for these disorders, and rate attitude statements regarding the two characters. Results: Australian participants recognized the presented symptoms as specific mental disorders significantly more than Iraqi and Sudanese participants did, and reported causal and treatment beliefs which were more congruent with expert beliefs as per the western medical model of mental disorder. The Sudanese group endorsed supernatural and religious causal beliefs regarding depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms most often; but both Sudanese and Iraqi participants strongly supported options from the supernatural and religious treatment items. However, evidence for pluralistic belief systems was also found. Conclusions: Although sampling was non-random, suggesting caution in the interpretation of results, it appears that the mental health literacy of lay Australians may be more aligned with the western medical model of mental disorder than that of Iraqi and Sudanese refugee communities. Mental health literacy support needs of Iraqi and Sudanese refugee communities resettled in western countries such as Australia might include education about specific symptoms and causes of mental disorder and the effectiveness of psychiatric treatments. These findings provide useful directions for the promotion of optimal service utilization among such communities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Genetic essentialism suggests that beliefs in genetic causes of mental illness will inflate a desire for social distance from affected individuals, regardless of specific disorder. However, genetic contingency theory predicts that genetic attributions will lead to an increased desire for social distance only from persons with disorders who are perceived as dangerous. Purpose: To assess the interactive effect of diagnosis and attribution on social distance and actual helping decisions across disorders. Methods: Undergraduate students (n = 149) were randomly assigned to read one of the six vignettes depicting a person affected by one of the three disorders (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression) with either a genetic or environmental causal attribution for disorder. Participants completed measures of perceived dangerousness, social distance, empathic concern, familiarity with mental illness, and actual helping decisions. Results: When provided with genetic attributions, participants’ desire for social distance was greater for targets with schizophrenia relative to targets with depression or bipolar disorder. This effect was mediated by perceived dangerousness. The indirect effect of diagnosis on helping decisions, through social distance, was significant within the genetic attribution condition. Conclusion: Consistent with genetic contingency theory, genetic attributions for schizophrenia, but not affective disorders, lead to greater desire for social distance via greater perceived dangerousness. Further, results suggest that genetic attributions decrease the likelihood of helping people with schizophrenia, but have no effect on the likelihood of helping people with affective disorders. These effects are partially accounted for by desired social distance from people with schizophrenia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Sexual dysfunction, common in general medical practice, is under-recognized and inadequately managed resulting in significant morbidity and reduction in quality of life. We examined the nature, prevalence, clinical features and explanatory models of illness among men with sexual dysfunction in a general healthcare setting.; Methods: We recruited 270 consecutive men attending a general health clinic. Participants were evaluated using a structured interview. The International Index of Erectile Function-5, the Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation-5, Short Explanatory Model Interview and the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule were used to assess sexual dysfunction, explanatory models and psychiatric morbidity.; Results: Premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction were reported by 43.0% and 47.8% of men, respectively. The most common perceived causes were loss of semen due to masturbation and nocturnal emission. Popular treatments were herbal remedies and resources used were traditional healers. The factors associated with erectile dysfunction were diabetes mellitus, financial stress, past history of psychiatric treatment and common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety; those associated with premature ejaculation were common mental disorders, older age and financial debt. Sexual dysfunctions and concerns were under-diagnosed by physicians when compared to the research interview.; Conclusion: There is a need to recognize sexual problems and effectively manage them in general medical settings. The need for sex education in schools and through the mass media, to remove sexual misconceptions, cannot be under-emphasized. (Copyright 2014, NMJI.)},

Abstract = {Background: Association between education and desire for social distance from people with mental illness is unclear. Aims: (1) Is there an association between education and social distance from people with a depression or schizophrenia? (2) Can this association be explained by beliefs about causes of and emotional reactions to the mental disorders? (3) Are there differences between the two mental disorders? Methods: Analyses are based on a telephone survey in two large German cities (Hamburg and Munich, N = 2,014, response rate 51%). Vignettes with typical signs and symptoms suggestive of depression and schizophrenia were presented. Respondents were asked about beliefs about causes of the mental disorders, their emotional reactions and their desire for social distance. Results: Lower education is significantly associated with a stronger tendency for social distance in the case of depression but not in case of schizophrenia, when age and gender are controlled. In case of depression, the association decreases when beliefs about possible causes are additionally controlled. In terms of schizophrenia, associations between education and social distance become stronger when emotional reactions are introduced. Conclusions: Our results underline that campaigns aimed at reducing stigma and social distance should consider specific emotional reactions and information needs of people with low education regarding different mental disorders.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the associations between beliefs about the causes of depression, schizophrenia, social phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and stigmatising attitudes towards people with these disorders. Methods: In 2011, telephone interviews were carried out with 6019 Australians aged 15 or over. Participants were presented with a case vignette describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia, chronic schizophrenia, social phobia or PTSD. Participants were asked about their beliefs about the causes of these disorders and about their personally held stigmatising attitudes, stigmatising attitudes perceived in others and the desire for social distance from the person described in the vignette. Results: Belief in a weak or nervous personality as the cause of mental disorders was most consistently associated with personal stigma, perceived stigma and desire for social distance across vignettes. Belief in biogenetic causes was associated with a decreased belief in mental disorders as due to weakness rather than sickness, but was not linked to either a decreased or increased belief in dangerousness and unpredictability or desire for social distance. Belief in physical causes was associated with an increased belief in mental disorders as due to weakness rather than sickness. Belief in psychosocial causes had no consistent associations with stigma. Conclusions: Explaining mental disorders as due to personality characteristics is a more important factor in stigma than either biogenetic or psychosocial explanations.

Abstract = {Understanding adolescents' perceptions of peers with depression is vital in order to tackle peer exclusion and lessen stigmatization. To examine adolescents' perceptions of a hypothetical peer with depression, we test an attributional model: that stigma towards persons with mental disorders is influenced by attributions about the causes of their disorders and inferences of personal responsibility. Participants were 401 adolescents from 4th year/10th grade with an age range of 14.75–17.08 years (M = 15.90 years; S.D. = 0.403 years). Structural Equation Modeling was employed to assess the relationships among causal attributions (personal control), perceived responsibility, and emotional reactions, in predicting social acceptance/exclusion of a peer with depression. Results indicated that (a) if the peer with depression is perceived as having little control over the cause of depression, responsibility is not inferred, participants feel sympathy and pity, and are likely to socially accept the peer (b) gender of vignette character and participant influence these responses. This study builds on our theoretical understanding of why adolescents with depression may face social exclusion from peers by applying a well‐established theory in social psychology. Findings should be incorporated into the design of interventions aimed at reducing peer exclusion and stigmatization of adolescents with depression.

Abstract = {The learned helplessness model and its various revisions suggest that causal attributions influence responses to events. This study examined relationships among the 3-factor symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represented in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and the individual dimensions of dispositional attributional style and trauma-specific attributions (i.e., internal–external, stable–unstable, global–specific). Relationships among attributions and clusters of PTSD symptoms represented by the 4-factor dysphoria model were also examined. Trauma-specific attributions were most predictive of PTSD symptoms, with higher associations for avoidance and numbing symptoms compared to arousal symptoms in the three-factor model and higher associations for dysphoria symptoms compared to arousal and avoidance symptoms in the four-factor dysphoria model. Results suggest that cognitive vulnerabilities could underlie the comorbidity between PTSD and depression and might represent a high-impact target for treatment.

Abstract = {Objective: It is unclear whether different biogenetic causal beliefs affect stigmatization of mentally-ill patients differently. It has been argued that in particular believing in a 'chemical imbalance' as a cause of mental disorder might be associated with more tolerant attitudes.; Method: In a representative population survey in Germany (n=3642), using unlabelled case vignettes of persons with depression, schizophrenia, or alcohol dependence, we elicited agreement with three different biogenetic explanations of the illness: 'Chemical imbalance of the brain', 'brain disease' and 'heredity'. We further investigated emotional reactions as well as the desire for social distance. For each vignette condition we calculated linear regressions with each biogenetic explanation as independent and emotional reactions as well as social distance as dependent variable controlling for socio-demographic variables.; Limitations: Our cross-sectional study does not allow statements regarding causality and the explanatory power of our statistical models was low.; Results: 'Chemical imbalance of the brain' and 'brain disease' were both associated with a stronger desire for social distance in schizophrenia and depression, and with more social acceptance in alcohol dependence, whereas 'heredity' was not significantly associated with social distance in any of the investigated illnesses. All three biogenetic causal beliefs were associated with more fear in all three illnesses.; Conclusion: Our study corroborates findings that biogenetic explanations have different effects in different disorders, and seem to be harmful in depression and schizophrenia. A particular de-stigmatizing potential of the causal belief 'chemical imbalance' could not be found. Implications for useful anti-stigma messages are discussed. (Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Background: Public beliefs about the causes of mental health problems are related to desire for distance and pessimism about recovery, and are therefore frequently studied. The beliefs of people receiving treatment are researched less often.; Method: An online survey on causal beliefs about depression and experiences with antidepressants was completed by 1829 New Zealand adults prescribed anti-depressants in the preceding five years, 97.4% of whom proceeded to take antidepressants.; Results: The most frequently endorsed of 17 causal beliefs were family stress, relationship problems, loss of loved one, financial problems, isolation, and abuse or neglect in childhood. Factor analysis produced three factors: 'bio-genetic', 'adulthood stress' and 'childhood adversity'. The most strongly endorsed explanations for increases in antidepressant prescribing invoked improved identification, reduced stigma and drug company marketing. The least strongly endorsed was 'Anti-depressants are the best treatment'. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported efficacy of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs, negatively associated with childhood adversity beliefs and unrelated to adulthood stress beliefs. The belief that 'People cannot׳ get better by themselves even if they try' was positively associated with bio-genetic beliefs.; Limitations: The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bio-genetic explanations, since 83% reported that the medication reduced their depression.; Conclusions: Clinicians׳ should consider exploring patients׳ causal beliefs. The public, even when taking antidepressants, continues to hold a multi-factorial causal model of depression with a primary emphasis on psycho-social causes. A three factor model of those beliefs may lead to more sophisticated understandings of relationships with stigma variables. (Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.)},

Abstract = {We explored beliefs about mental disorder categories that influence potential interactions with category members. Specifically, we investigated beliefs related to how membership in a mental disorder category is obtained (communicability and causal origin) as well as beliefs related to the underlying reality of disorder categories (essentialism and controllability). In Experiment 1, participants’ interaction-willingness decisions were predicted by their beliefs that a mental disorder category was (1) communicable, (2) psychologically caused, (3) environmentally caused, and (4) possessed all-or-none membership. With fictitious mental disorders, people were less willing to interact with people described as having a communicable mental disorder than with those described as possessing any of the other factors of interest, highlighting the independent influence of these contagion beliefs (Experiment 2). We further explored beliefs about the communicability of mental disorders in Experiment 3 by asking participants to generate descriptions of how mental disorders are transferred between people. Our findings suggest the importance of understanding contagion beliefs in discovering why people distance themselves from people diagnosed with mental disorders. More generally, our findings help in understanding how our basic category knowledge is used to guide interactions with category members, illustrating how knowledge is translated into action.

Abstract = {Objective: This study assessed participants’ experienced discrimination and their causal attributions, particularly to mental illness or race-ethnicity. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 202 service users with severe mental illnesses were interviewed to assess their reported experiences of discrimination. The Major Experiences of Discrimination Scale assessed major experiences of discrimination and their recency and frequency across 12 life domains and perceived reasons (attributions). The Everyday Experiences of Discrimination Scale assessed ten types of everyday discrimination and attributions for these experiences. Results: Most participants (88%) reported discrimination in at least one life domain, and 94% reported ever experiencing everyday discrimination. The most common areas of major discrimination were mental health care (44%), neighbors (42%), police (33%), employment (31%), and general medical care (31%). The most common attributions for major discrimination were mental illness (57%), race-ethnicity (24%), education or income (20%), or appearance (19%). Almost half (47%) attributed experiences of major discrimination to two or more causes. No differences were found between racial-ethnic groups in overall experienced discrimination or in main attributions to mental illness. However, compared with the mixed and white groups, participants in the black group were most likely to endorse race-ethnicity as a main attribution (p < .001). Conclusions: Mental illness– related discrimination was found to be a common issue across racial-ethnic groups, and discrimination based on race-ethnicity was prevalent for the mixed and black groups. There is a need for antidiscrimination strategies that combine efforts to reduce the experience of discrimination attributed to mental illness and to race-ethnicity for racial-ethnic minority groups.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Andres Barkil-Oteo et al. (see record [rid]2015-57504-008[/rid]). Education about mental health issues across the world was mostly confined to anthropology and transcultural psychiatry programmes in which the object of study was, for the most part, variation in causal attributions, the presentation of states of distress, and traditional healing practices. The focus on medical education is appropriate and necessary, one might also ask if global mental health is a field for medical doctors, exclusively. A public health orientation to education broadens global mental health so that the specialty, collectively, is more able to address complex challenges from an intersectoral perspective rather than focusing only on responses to biomedically defined disorders.

Abstract = {This study examined influences of causal attributions of schizophrenia and perceived and internalized mental illness stigma on perceived working alliance with, and informational support received from doctors practicing Western psychiatry in the Taiwanese social-cultural context. This cross-sectional quantitative study used a non-probability, purposive sampling technique to recruit 212 Taiwanese diagnosed with schizophrenia from Taiwanese Alliance of the Mentally Ill, 4 community mental health rehabilitation centres and 2 psychiatric hospitals between July 2012 and March 2013. Linear regression models were used for analysis. The results showed that environmental attributions were positively associated with both perceived working alliance and perceived informational support, while supernatural attributions were negatively associated with perceived working alliance and perceived informational support. Perceived stigma had a negative association with perceived working alliance. The discrimination domain of internalized stigma specifically had a positive association with perceived working alliance, while the withdraw domain had a negative association with perceived informational support. Findings inform the importance of culturally sensitive practices in developing an effective working relationship. Western psychiatric care providers need to explore consumers’ casual attributions of mental illness and understand the impact of stigma so that providers may successfully engage consumers in care and provide tailored illness education and information.

Abstract = {Background: Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a promising candidate susceptibility gene for psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. Several previous studies reported that mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced L100P mutation in Disc1 showed some schizophrenia-related behavioral phenotypes. This line originally carried several thousands of ENU-induced point mutations in the C57BL/6 J strain and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the DBA/2 J inbred strain.Methods: To investigate the effect of Disc1 L100P, background mutations and SNPs on phenotypic characterization, we performed behavioral analyses to better understand phenotypes of Disc1 L100P mice and comprehensive genetic analyses using whole-exome resequencing and SNP panels to map ENU-induced mutations and strain-specific SNPs, respectively.Results: We found no differences in spontaneous or methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity, sociability or social novelty preference among Disc1 L100P/L100P, L100P/+ mutants and wild-type littermates. Whole-exome resequencing of the original G1 mouse identified 117 ENU-induced variants, including Disc1 L100P per se. Two females and three males from the congenic L100P strain after backcrossing to C57BL/6 J were deposited to RIKEN BioResource Center in 2008. We genotyped them with DBA/2 J × C57BL/6 J SNPs and found a number of the checked SNPs still remained.Conclusion: These results suggest that causal attribution of the discrepancy in behavioral phenotypes to the Disc1 L100P mutant mouse line existing among different research groups needs to be cautiously investigated in further study by taking into account the effect(s) of other ENU-induced mutations and/or SNPs from DBA/2 J.

Abstract = {This study investigated the Australian public's beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia and whether these beliefs have changed over a 16-year period. Data came from the 2011 Australian National Survey of Mental Health Literacy and Stigma which involved telephone interviews with 1995 Australians aged 15 or over. The survey interview used the same questions as those of the 2003/4 and 1995 national mental health literacy surveys, in which participants were presented with a case vignette describing either early or chronic schizophrenia. Questions were asked about recognition of, exposure to and causal beliefs about these disorders, including those relating to psychosocial, biogenetic and personality factors. Results showed that most Australians believe in multifactorial causes of schizophrenia and that, between 1995 and 2011, belief in problems from childhood and inherited or genetic causes of early schizophrenia increased while belief in weakness of character decreased. Overall, the findings are consistent with evidence that mental health literacy in Australia has improved over a 16-year period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background. The objectives of the study were to explore the knowledge and attitudes of Pakistani university students toward mental illnesses. People with mental illnesses are challenged not only by their symptoms but also by the prejudices associated with their illness. Acknowledging the stigma of mental illness should be the first essential step toward devising an appropriate treatment plan. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the University of Punjab, Lahore, CMH Lahore Medical and Dental College, Lahore, and University of Sargodha, Sub-campus Lahore, from February to May 2014. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographics, general knowledge of psychiatric illnesses, and Community Attitudes towards Mental Illnesses (CAMI) Scale. The questionnaire was distributed to 650 participants enrolled in different disciplines (Social Sciences, Medicine and Formal Sciences). Results. Response rate was 81% (527/650 respondents). Mean age was 20.98 years. Most of the students (331, 62.8%) had an urban background and studied Social Sciences (238, 45.2%). Four hundred and eighteen respondents (79.3%) considered religion very important and most respondents considered psychiatrists (334, 63.4%) and spiritual leaders (72, 13.7%) to be best able to treat mental illnesses. One hundred and sixty nine respondents (32.1%) considered black magic to be a cause of mental illness. Only 215 (41%) respondents had ever read an article on mental illnesses. Multiple regression analysis revealed study discipline, exposure, perceived causes of mental illnesses and superstitions to be significantly associated with attitudes towards mental illnesses (p < .05). Conclusion. Although low awareness and exposure were found in this sample of Pakistani university students, their attitude towards mental illnesses was generally positive. Most respondents gave supernatural explanations for mental illnesses but only a few believed that spiritual leaders can play a role in treatment.},

Abstract = {Encounters with Western psychiatric treatment and acculturation may influence causal beliefs of psychiatric illness endorsed by Chinese immigrant relatives, thus affecting help-seeking. We examined causal beliefs held by forty-six Chinese immigrant relatives and found that greater acculturation was associated with an increased number of causal beliefs. Further, as Western psychiatric treatment and acculturation increased, causal models expanded to incorporate biological/physical causes. However, frequency of Chinese immigrant relatives' endorsing spiritual beliefs did not appear to change with acculturation. Clinicians might thus account for spiritual beliefs in treatment even after acculturation increases and biological causal models proliferate.},

Abstract = {Background: This study aims to examine the public’s attitudes and predictors of social distance towards women afflicted by eating disorders (anorexia nervosa [AN] and bulimia nervosa [BN]) under specific consideration of the respondents’ sex. Eating disorders are still often seen as a women’s health issue, and those afflicted remain stigmatized in Western societies. The concept of social distance is a frequently used indicator in awareness campaigns. Sex-specific results could add important information to destigmatization programs. Methods: Data originate from a German telephone survey which was conducted in 2011. Vignettes with signs and symptoms either suggestive of AN or BN were presented to the respondents randomly, who subsequently answered questions regarding beliefs about causes, contact to persons afflicted as well as desire for social distance. Stratified multiple linear regression analyses according to disorder under study were performed to examine associations between different predictors and desire for social distance. Results: There were significant sex differences in desire for social distance, causal attributions, and emotional reactions towards women with eating disorders. E.g., with respect to AN, women exhibited a significantly greater desire for social distance than men (p<.001), and more frequently believed that AN could be caused by sexual abuse during childhood. Regarding predictors of social distance, there was a significant positive association between age and desire for social distance equally among men and women. However, distinct sex differences came into effect concerning other predictors depending on the eating disorder under study. In BN, attribution of brain disease emerged as significant predictor of social distance among men. This is not true for women, where the attribution of weak will significantly predicted the desire for social distance. Conclusion: Sex-dependent differences in attitudes and predictors of social distance towards females afflicted should be met with tailored measures in anti-stigma campaigns, addressing women and men on different levels.

Abstract = {This study compares brain activation during causal attribution to three different loci, the self, another person and the situation; and further explores correlations with clinical scales (i.e. depression, anxiety and autism) in a typical population. While they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging, 20 participants read short sentences about another person ('someone') who engaged in behaviors with the participant or made comments about the participant. The participants then attributed these behaviors to three attribution loci: themselves, the other person or the situation. The results revealed common activation across the three attribution loci in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), left posterior superior temporal sulcus, precuneus and right temporal pole (TP). Comparisons between the attribution loci revealed very little differences, except for increased activation of the right TP while making attributions to the situation compared with the self. In addition, when making attributions to the situation or other persons for negative events, there were reliable correlations between low activity in the left TPJ and high levels of anxiety and problematic social interaction in autism. The results indicate that attributions to different loci are based on the same underlying brain process, which might be atypical among persons with anxiety or autism symptoms.

Abstract = {Culture and religion play a significant role in the development and maintenance of mental health stigma. They influence beliefs about the causes of mental illness and also impact willingness to seek treatment. In the United States, little is known about the psychological adjustment of South Asians, particularly Indian immigrants and first generation Indian American Christians. In this study, I investigated the effect of acculturation, ethnic identity, and religious commitment on stigma, etiological beliefs about common childhood and adolescent psychological disorders (attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and autism), and help-seeking attitudes in the Indian Orthodox population. Forty-six Indian immigrants and 64 first generation Indian Americans completed electronic or paper questionnaires assessing their level of acculturation, ethnic identity, and religious commitment. Participants also completed measures on stigma, help-seeking attitudes, and causal beliefs (biological, psychosocial, and spiritual). The results showed that religious commitment was negatively associated with stigma and positively associated with help-seeking attitudes. Participants who rated high on acculturation endorsed biological underpinning for ADHD, autism, depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse. Previous knowledge of mental illness was linked to fewer ratings of spiritual causes for ADHD, autism and depression, but religious commitment was associated with increased ratings of spiritual causes for alcohol abuse.

Abstract = {Underutilization of mental health services in the U.S. is compounded among racial/ethnic minorities, especially Chinese Americans. Culturally based illness beliefs influence help-seeking behavior and may provide insights into strategies for increasing utilization rates among vulnerable populations. This is the first large descriptive study of depressed Chinese American immigrant patients’ illness beliefs using a standardized instrument. 190 depressed Chinese immigrants seeking primary care at South Cove Community Health Center completed the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue, which probes different dimensions of illness beliefs: chief complaint, labeling of illness, stigma perception, causal attributions, and help-seeking patterns. Responses were sorted into categories by independent raters and results compared to an earlier study at the same site and using the same instrument. Contrary to prior findings that depressed Chinese individuals tend to present with primarily somatic symptoms, subjects were more likely to report chief complaints and illness labels related to depressed mood than physical symptoms. Nearly half reported they would conceal the name of their problem from others. Mean stigma levels were significantly higher than in the previous study. Most subjects identified psychological stress as the most likely cause of their problem. Chinese immigrants’ illness beliefs were notable for psychological explanations regarding their symptoms, possibly reflecting increased acceptance of Western biomedical frameworks, in accordance with recent research. However, reported stigma regarding these symptoms also increased. As Asian American immigrant populations increasingly accept psychological models of depression, stigma may become an increasingly important target for addressing disparities in mental health service utilization.

Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate differences in the beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia between Aymara and non-Aymara patients with schizophrenia and their primary caregivers. Ethnic background plays an important role in the formation of beliefs regarding the causes of schizophrenia, and there have been no prior studies on such beliefs among the Aymara, an indigenous community with a population of about 2 million people living in the Andes. We focused on three systems of beliefs distinguished in the literature: biological, psychosocial and magical–religious. Methods: The sample comprised 253 patients (n = 117 Aymara, and n = 136 non-Aymara) of public mental health centers in Chile (33.6%), Peru (33.6%) and Bolivia (32.8%) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and each patient’s primary caregiver. We administered to patients and caregivers a questionnaire with scales assessing the perceived causes of schizophrenia. Linear regression models were fitted to compare differences in the levels of causal beliefs between Aymara and non-Aymara patients and caregivers, and to identify socio-demographic and clinical predictors of different types of beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia. Results: Adjusted for socio-demographic and clinical covariates, levels of psychosocial beliefs were significantly higher for Aymara caregivers (0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.05, 0.62) than non-Aymara caregivers. Conclusions: Contrary to expectations, beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia among Aymara are not more magical–religious than those of their non-Aymara counterparts. It may be necessary for mental health staff members to evaluate beliefs about the disorder, especially in ethnic minorities, before applying a standard model of treatment.

Abstract = {Causal attributions are a key factor in explanatory models of illness; however, little research on causal attributions of mental illness has been conducted in developing nations in the Caribbean, including Jamaica. Explanatory models of mental illness may be important in understanding illness experience and be a crucial factor in mental health service seeking and utilization. We explored causal attributions of mental illness in Jamaica by conducting 20 focus groups, including 16 community samples, 2 patient samples, and 2 samples of caregivers of patients, with a total of 159 participants. The 5 most commonly endorsed causal attributions of mental illness are discussed: (a) drug-related causes, including ganja (marijuana); (b) biological causes, such as chemical imbalance, familial transmission, and 'blood'; (c) psychological causes, including stress and thinking too much; (d) social causes, such as relationship problems and job loss; and (e) spiritual or religious causes, including Obeah.

Abstract = {Background: The beliefs of people receiving treatment about the causes of their own mental health problems are researched less often than the causal beliefs of the public, but have important implications for relationships with prescribers, treatment choices and recovery. Method: An online survey on a range of beliefs about depression, and experiences with antidepressants, was completed by 1829 New Zealand adults prescribed anti-depressants in the preceding five years, 97.4% of whom proceeded to take antidepressants. Results: Six of 17 beliefs about the causes of their own depression were endorsed by more than half the sample: chemical imbalance, family stress, work stress, heredity, relationship problems and distressing events in childhood. There were some marked differences in content, structure and level of conviction of beliefs about one's own depression and the sample's previously published beliefs about depression in general. There were also significant differences between the beliefs of demographic groupings. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported effectiveness of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs. The quality of the relationship with the prescribing doctor was positively related to a belief in chemical imbalance as a cause and negatively related to a belief in unemployment as a cause. Limitations: The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bio-genetic explanations, since 83% reported that the medication reduced their depression. Conclusions: People experiencing depression hold complex, multifactorial and idiosyncratic sets of beliefs about the causes of their own depression, apparently based at least in part on their own life experiences and circumstances. Exploring those beliefs may enhance the doctor–patient relationship and selection of appropriate treatment modality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Given the vast literature into public beliefs and attitudes towards schizophrenia and depression, there is paucity of research on attitudes towards bipolar disorder despite its similar prevalence to schizophrenia. This study explored public beliefs and attitudes towards bipolar disorder and examined the relationship between these different components of stigma. Method: Using an online questionnaire distributed via email, social networking sites and public institutions, 753 members of the UK population were presented with a vignette depicting someone who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder. Causal beliefs, beliefs about prognosis, emotional reactions, stereotypes, and social distance were assessed in response to the vignette. Preacher and Hayes procedure for estimating direct and indirect effects of multiple mediators was used to examine the relationship between these components of stigma. Results: Bipolar disorder was primarily associated with positive beliefs and attitudes and elicited a relatively low desire for social distance. Fear partially mediated the relationship between stereotypes and social distance. Biomedical causal beliefs reduced desire for social distance by increasing compassion, whereas fate causal beliefs increased it through eliciting fear. Psychosocial causal beliefs had mixed effects. Limitations: The measurement of stigma using vignettes and self-report questionnaires has implications for ecological validity and participants may have been reluctant to reveal the true extent of their negative attitudes. Conclusions: Dissemination of these findings to people with bipolar disorder has implications for the reduction of internalised stigma in this population. Anti-stigma campaigns should attend to causal beliefs, stereotypes and emotional reactions as these all play a vital role in discriminatory behaviour towards people with bipolar disorder.

Abstract = {The Virginia Tech and Columbine High shootings are 2 of the deadliest school massacres in the United States. The present study investigates in a nationally representative sample how White Americans’ causal attributions of these shooting moderate their attitudes toward the shooter’s race. White Americans shown a vignette based on the Virginia Tech shooting were more likely to espouse negative beliefs about Korean American men and distance themselves from this group the more they believed that the shooter’s race caused the shooting. Among those who were shown a vignette based on the Columbine High shooting, believing that mental illness caused the shooting was associated with weaker negative beliefs about White American men. White Americans in a third condition who were given the Virginia Tech vignette and prompted to subtype the shooter according to his race were less likely to possess negative beliefs about Korean American men the more they believed that mental illness caused the shooting. There was no evidence for the ultimate attribution error. Theoretical accounts based on the stereotype and in-group-out-group bias literature are presented. The current findings have important implications for media depictions of minority group behavior and intergroup relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Using the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide as a guiding framework, we investigated older adults' causal attributions for suicidal behavior. We hypothesized that older adults who attributed their suicidal behavior to thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness would be more likely to use more immediately lethal means and to re-attempt suicide during the 12-month follow-up. Design: Prospective cohort study in western Sweden. Participants: A total of 101 older adults who presented to medical emergency rooms for suicide attempts. Measurements: Participants were asked why they attempted suicide. Results: Attributions included: a desire to escape (N = 29), reduced functioning and autonomy (N = 24), psychological problems, including depression (N = 24), somatic problems and physical pain (N = 16), perceived burdensomeness (N = 13), social problems that reflected either thwarted belongingness or family conflict (N = 13), and lack of meaning in life (N = 8); 41 participants provided more than one reason. No specific reason was given by 28 participants, 15 of whom reported not understanding or remembering why they attempted suicide and 13 reported simply wanting to die (or go to sleep and not wake up). As hypothesized, patients who attributed the attempt to thwarted belongingness were more likely to use more immediately lethal means for their index attempt and were more likely to re-attempt during follow-up. This was not the case for those reporting burdensomeness. Conclusion: People who attribute suicide attempts to thwarted belongingness use more lethal methods and have a poorer prognosis. Replications across diverse cultural settings are needed to determine whether attributing suicide attempts to thwarted belongingness may warrant increased monitoring.

Abstract = {Gay men are at higher risk of suicidality. This paper describes the causes of suicide attempts as perceived by the men themselves and analyzes their impact on severity and recidivism. Mental health surveys conducted among gay men in Geneva, Switzerland, from two probability-based time-space samples in 2007 and 2011, were merged to yield a combined sample N = 762. Suicide ideation, plans, and attempts were assessed, and respondents who had ever attempted suicide answered open questions about perceived causes which were coded and categorized for analysis within the framework of cultural epidemiology. In all, 16.7% of the respondents reported a suicide attempt in their lifetime (59.5% of them with multiple attempts). At their latest attempt, over two thirds asserted intent to die, and half required medical assistance. There was a wide variety of perceived causes, with most individuals reporting multiple causes and many of the most common causes cited at both the first and most recent subsequent attempts. Social/inter-personal problems constitute the most prominent category. Problems with love/relationship and accepting one’s homosexuality figure consistently among the top three causes. Whereas the former tend to be associated with weaker intent to die, the latter are associated with the strongest intent to die and reported at multiple attempts. Problems with family are among the most common perceived causes at first attempt but not at the most recent subsequent attempt. Nevertheless, they tend to be related to the strongest intent to die and the greatest medical severity of all the perceived causes. Ten percent of men attempting suicide cited depression as a cause. Although it tended to be associated with weaker intent to die, depression was most likely to be reported at multiple attempts. Respondent-driven assessment yielded both common and idiosyncratic causes of suicide and their distinct effects. Some of these perceived causes are not prominent in the current literature, yet they have important implications for understanding risk and preventing suicide among gay men.

Abstract = {Background: This study explores relationships between Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and quality and frequency of involvement with family and friends. Methods: Data are from a nationally representative sample of African American and Black Caribbean adults (n = 5191), the National Survey of American Life. SAD was assessed using the DSM-IV World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: Findings indicated that among both populations, close supportive ties with family members and friends are protective against meeting criteria for SAD. Negative interactions with family (e.g., conflicts), however, are a risk factor for SAD among both African Americans and Black Caribbeans. For African Americans, an interaction indicates that the relationship between negative interaction and social anxiety is much stronger among African Americans who are not emotionally close to their families. For Caribbean Blacks, an interaction suggests that the odds of meeting criteria for SAD were higher among Black Caribbeans who had high negative interaction with family as well as low levels of friendship closeness. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow for causal attributions for findings. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that SAD may impact black ethnic subgroups differently, which has important implications for understanding the nature, etiology, and treatment of this disorder.

Abstract = {Aims: Previous population-based studies did not support the view that biological and genetic causal models help increase social acceptance of people with mental illness. However, practically all these studies used un-labelled vignettes depicting symptoms of the disorders of interest. Thus, in these studies the public's reactions to pathological behaviour had been assessed rather than reactions to psychiatric disorders that had explicitly been labelled as such. The question arises as to whether results would have been similar if respondents had been confronted with vignettes with explicit mention of the respective diagnosis. Methods: Analyses are based on data of a telephone survey in two German metropolises conducted in 2011. Case-vignettes with typical symptoms suggestive of depression or schizophrenia were presented to the respondents. After presentation of the vignette respondents were informed about the diagnosis. Results: We found a statistically significant association of the endorsement of brain disease as a cause with greater desire for social distance from persons with schizophrenia. In major depression, this relation was absent. With both disorders, there was no statistically significant association between the endorsement of hereditary factors as a cause and social distance. Conclusions: Irrespective of whether unlabelled or labelled vignettes are employed, the ascription to biological or genetic causes seems not to be associated with a reduction of the public's desire for social distance from people with schizophrenia or depression. Our results corroborate the notion that promulgating biological and genetic causal models may not help decrease the stigma surrounding these illnesses.

Abstract = {Purpose: Common mental disorders (CMDs) are major causes of sickness absence and disability. Prevention requires knowledge of how individuals perceive causal mechanisms, and in this study we sought to examine work-related factors as causal attribution of CMDs. Methods: A trial sample of n = 1,193, recruited because they struggled with work participation due to CMDs, answered an open-ended questionnaire item about what they believed were the most important causes of their CMDs. The population included participants at risk of sickness absence, and participants with reduced work participation due to sickness absence, disability or unemployment. We used thematic content analysis and categorized responses from 487 participants who reported work-related factors as causal attributions of their CMDs. Gender differences in work-related causal attributions were also examined. Results: The participants attributed their CMDs to the following work-related factors; work stress, leadership, reduced work participation, job dissatisfaction, work conflict, social work environment, job insecurity and change, workplace bullying, and physical strain. Women tended to attribute CMDs to social factors at work. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest several work-related risk factors for CMDs. Both factors at the workplace, and reduced work participation, were perceived by study participants as contributing causes of CMDs. Thus, there is a need to promote work participation whilst at the same time targeting aversive workplace factors. Further, our findings indicate that work-related factors may affect women and men differently. This illustrates that the association between work participation and CMDs is complex, and needs to be explored further. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Many families worldwide have at least one member with a behavioral or mental disorder, and yet the majority of the public fails to correctly recognize symptoms of mental illness. Previous research has found that Mental Health Literacy (MHL)—the knowledge and positive beliefs about mental disorders—tends to be higher in European and North American cultures, compared to Asian and African cultures. Nonetheless quantitative research examining the variables that explain this cultural difference remains limited. The purpose of our study was fourfold: (a) to validate measures of MHL cross-culturally, (b) to examine the MHL model quantitatively, (c) to investigate cultural differences in the MHL model, and (d) to examine collectivism as a predictor of MHL. We validated measures of MHL in European American and Indian samples. The results lend strong quantitative support to the MHL model. Recognition of symptoms of mental illness was a central variable: greater recognition predicted greater endorsement of social causes of mental illness and endorsement of professional help-seeking as well as lesser endorsement of lay help-seeking. The MHL model also showed an overwhelming cultural difference; namely, lay help-seeking beliefs played a central role in the Indian sample, and a negligible role in the European American sample. Further, collectivism was positively associated with causal beliefs of mental illness in the European American sample, and with lay help-seeking beliefs in the Indian sample. These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding cultural differences in beliefs about mental illness, particularly in relation to help-seeking beliefs.

Abstract = {Beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia are thought to impact treatment outcomes. We investigated 3 theoretically opposing belief systems (biological, psychosocial, magical–religious) in relation to the severity of positive and negative symptoms and to attitudes towards medications. We recruited 253 patients with schizophrenia and their primary caregivers from public mental health clinics in Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. We assessed patients’ and caregivers’ beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia, which were used as predictors of symptom severity and medication attitudes in linear regression analyses. Patients’ scores on biological, psychosocial, and magical–religious beliefs were positively correlated with one another, indicating that these domains were not, as anticipated, 'opposing'. Patients with higher levels of biological and psychosocial beliefs had significantly lower levels of positive and negative symptoms; in contrast, higher levels of magical–religious beliefs were associated with increased positive symptoms and less favorable attitudes towards medications. Patients’ belief systems are significant predictors of symptom severity and medication attitudes. Research is needed on the extent to which psychotherapeutic treatments for schizophrenia should bolster patients’ beliefs in the biological and psychosocial domains and weaken beliefs in the magical–religious domain; this research should also attend to the ethical considerations involved in intervening on belief systems cross-culturally.

Abstract = {Purpose: We aimed to investigate mental health help-seeking intentions and preferences of rural Chinese adults and determine predictors of the intentions. Methods: A total of 2052 representative rural residents aged 18–60 completed a cross-sectional survey by face-to-face interviews. The survey included seven questions asking about respondents’ help-seeking intentions and preferences, and a series of internationally validated instruments to assess self-perceived health status, depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, mental health literacy, and attitudes towards mental illness. Results: Nearly 80% of respondents were willing to seek psychological help if needed, and 72.4% preferred to get help from medical organizations, yet only 12% knew of any hospitals or clinics providing such help. A multivariate analysis of help-seeking intention revealed that being female, having lower education, higher social health, higher mental health knowledge, and physical causal attribution for depression were positive predictors of help-seeking intention. Conclusion: A huge gap exists between the relatively higher intention for help-seeking and significantly lower knowledge of helpful resources. Predictors of help-seeking intention for mental problems in the current study are consistent with previous studies. Interventions to increase help-seeking for mental problems by Chinese rural adults may be best served by focusing on increasing public awareness of help sources, as well as improving residents’ mental health literacy and social health, with special focus on males and those more educated.

Abstract = {Much debate exists surrounding the applicability of genetic information in the courtroom, making the psychological processes underlying how people consider this information important to explore. This article addresses how people think about different kinds of causal explanations in legal decision-making contexts. Three studies involving a total of 600 Mechanical Turk and university participants found that genetic, versus environmental, explanations of criminal behavior lead people to view the applicability of various defense claims differently, perceive the perpetrator's mental state differently, and draw different causal attributions. Moreover, mediation and path analyses highlight the double-edged nature of genetic attributions-they simultaneously reduce people's perception of the perpetrator's sense of control while increasing people's tendencies to attribute the cause to internal factors and to expect the perpetrator to reoffend. These countervailing relations, in turn, predict sentencing in opposite directions, although no overall differences in sentencing or ultimate verdicts were found.

Abstract = {School nurses often are the first (and most sustained) point of contact for children with medical issues and, as such, they are well poised to provide early intervention for children with chronic abdominal pain. Therefore, the current study sought to assess school nurses’ perspectives and practices related to chronic abdominal pain. A study invitation and link to a web-based questionnaire were sent to members of the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) with published e-mail addresses. A total of 1,550 school nurses (∼11% response rate) participated in the study. Approximately 1/3 of the sample reported >90 annual student visits for abdominal pain. Fifty-seven percent perceived the most common cause for childhood chronic abdominal pain as related to psychosocial issues. Although psychosocial issues were the most commonly perceived cause of pain, 66% of nurses reported collaborating with mental health professionals <10% of the time. Half of the nurses sampled were not confident in their understanding of chronic abdominal pain in children, and 27% perceived nursing education available on the topic to be nonexistent or poor. School nurses frequently see children with abdominal pain, primarily believe psychosocial/behavioral issues to account for it (although rarely collaborate with mental health professionals), and know little about biological contributors to and classification of the condition. These findings indicate a need for an evidence-based curriculum for school nurse training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Mental disorders are among the leading causes of disability in the United States. In 2011, over 10 million adults felt that even though they needed treatment for mental health problems, they received insufficient or no mental health care and reported unmet need. This article assesses associations between sociodemographic characteristics and perceived causes of unmet needs for mental health care. Method: A sample of 2,564 adults with unmet mental health need was obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Outcome variables were 5 main reasons for unmet need: cost, stigma, minimization, low perceived treatment effectiveness, and structural barriers. Each cause of unmet need was regressed on sociodemographic, health, and service use characteristics. Women had higher odds of cost-related reasons for unmet need than men. Odds of stigma and structural barriers were greater among Blacks than Whites, and among rural than metropolitan residents. Compared with the uninsured, insured persons were less likely to report cost barriers. However, insured persons had higher odds of stigma and minimization of mental disorders. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Insurance alone is unlikely to resolve the problem of unmet need. Understanding the social epidemiology of perceived unmet need will help identify populations at risk of not receiving mental health care or insufficient care. Focusing on specific programs and services that are designed to address the causes of perceived unmet need in particular populations is important. Future research should explore how intersecting social statuses affect the likelihood of perceived unmet need. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Previous research has highlighted the critical role of parents’ perceptions of their family member with intellectual disability (ID) in family well-being and adjustment. The Kansas Inventory of Parental Perceptions (KIPP; Behr et al. 1992) was specifically designed to assess parents’ perceptions of their children with disability. The KIPP is composed of four scales: Positive Contributions, Social Comparisons, Causal Attributions and Perceived Control. The goal of this study was to adapt a shortened form of the KIPP to the Spanish population. The study participants comprised 861 families with a family member with ID. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify the underlying dimensions of the four scales of the KIPP. The results showed the internal consistency of the subscale scores to be good, and the correlations with Family Quality of Life measures provided evidence of the concurrent criterion validity of the KIPP scores. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study explored (a) CVS-related health experiences, (b) impact on relationships, employment, education, and leisure time as well as (c) responses to CVS-related treatments. Background: Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a chronic gastrointestinal tract disorder affecting 3% to 14% of patients experiencing unexplained nausea and vomiting who were referred to health centers in the United States. Patients experience frequent cycles of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain placing them at risk for life-threatening health complications. These incapacitating episodes impact social, emotional, and physical health, however minimal research has focused on descriptions of illness perception, life impact, and response to treatment. Methods: Purposive sampling was used in this phenomenological study to recruit 16 adults, 21 years or older with a diagnosis of CVS for more than one year. Data were collected electronically via Survey MonkeyRTM. Type-written data was analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison techniques. Demographic data, also collected electronically, was described using Excel. Results: All 16 participants were Caucasian. Eleven were female and five were male. Participants ranged in age from 22 to 59 years at the time of the study. Six participants were classified as having pediatric-onset CVS and 10 were classified as having adult-onset CVS. Seven global themes emerged from the data: (a) perceived causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome, (b) triggers for CVS episodes, (c) onset of illness and symptoms of CVS, (d) understanding the chronic course of CVS, (e) impact on day-to-day life, (f) lack of health care provider knowledge, and (g) responses to CVS-related treatments. Participants discussed limited understanding of illness etiology. However, they revealed understanding CVS as a chronic and cyclic illness. Emphasis was placed on triggers for CVS, life impact, lack of health care provider knowledge leading to diagnostic delay, avoidance of care, and inappropriate treatment. Prophylactic, abortive, and self-management was discussed. Discussions of emotional impact highlight the need for multidisciplinary care to insure that physical as well as mental health issues are considered and addressed. Findings present the need for increased CVS awareness and education to improve health care, access, and quality of care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The study of mental illness attributions, or beliefs about the causes of mental illness, is well-documented and ongoing in the academic literature. Attributions have traditionally been dichotomized along four dimensions based on their locus, controllability, specificity, and stability and have been associated with a wide variety of thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and actions related to mental illness. However, more recent studies have introduced a new cross-cultural model incorporating lay beliefs about the specific biological, emotional, social, and spiritual causes of mental health problems. The present research outlines the design and initial validation of a comprehensive, international measure of causal beliefs using this new model, the Mental Illness Attribution Questionnaire (MIAQ). The four-stage research project included item formulation, piloting, identification of factor structure, qualitative rating tasks, and initial validation with a sample of 680 international students representing 94 nations. Factors captured causes related to supernatural forces, social/stress, lifestyle, physical health, substance use, heredity/biology, and personal weakness. This structure was tested for model fit using confirmatory factor analysis across three vignette conditions -- one each describing a man with schizophrenia, depression, or alcoholism -- with further examination yielding strong test-retest reliability and promising convergent, discriminant, and cultural validity data. Taken together, these results provide tentative support for the reliability and validity of the MIAQ as a comprehensive measure of seven categories of mental illness attribution. The measure was validated using existing standards for international scale development and has strong potential for understanding attribution and stigmatizing behavior across cultures.

Abstract = {Objective: Previous studies have found biological conceptualizations of psychopathology to be associated with stigmatizing attitudes and prognostic pessimism. This research investigated how biological and psychosocial explanations for a child’s ADHD symptoms differ in affecting laypeople’s stigmatizing attitudes and prognostic beliefs. Method: Three experiments were conducted online with U.S. adults, using vignettes that described a child with ADHD and attributed his symptoms to either biological or psychosocial causes. Dependent measures gauged social distance and expectations about the child’s prognosis. Results: Across all three studies, the biological explanation yielded more doubt about treatability but less social distance—a result that diverges from previous research with other disorders. Differences in the amount of blame ascribed to the child mediated the social distance effect. Conclusion: The effects of biological explanations on laypeople’s views of ADHD seem to be a 'double-edged sword,' reducing social rejection but exacerbating perceptions of the disorder as relatively untreatable.

Abstract = {Marital attributions—that is, causal inferences and explanations spouses make about their partners’ behavior—have been implicated as predictors of relationship functioning. Extending previous work, we examined marital attributions as a moderator of the link between marital conflict and depressive symptoms 1 year later. Participants were 284 couples who reported on marital attributions and depressive symptoms. Couples also engaged in a videotaped marital conflict interaction, which was later coded for specific conflict behaviors. The results showed that husbands’ and wives’ marital attributions about their partner moderated relations between marital conflict behavior and later depressive symptoms, controlling for global marital sentiments. For husbands, positive behavior and affect during marital conflict predicted a decrease in depressive symptoms, but only for husbands’ who made low levels of responsibility and causal attributions about their wives. Wives’ causal attributions about their partner also moderated relations between positive behavior and affect during marital conflict and husbands’ later depressive symptoms. Reflecting an unexpected finding, negative behavior and affect during marital conflict predicted increases in wives’ depressive symptoms, but only for wives who made low levels of responsibility attributions about their partner. The findings suggest that, for husbands, low levels of negative marital attributions for spouses may be protective, strengthening the positive effect of constructive conflict behaviors for their mental health, whereas for wives low levels of responsibility attributions about their spouse may be a risk factor, exacerbating the negative effect of negative marital conflict behaviors on their later depressive symptoms.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the role of provider communication about psychosocial causes of abdominal pain and recommendations for psychosocial intervention during a gastroenterology clinic visit in predicting families' causal beliefs and perceptions of treatment acceptability.; Method: Participants were 57 children with a diagnosed or suspected abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) presenting for an outpatient gastroenterology follow-up visit and their accompanying parent. Children and parents completed questionnaires assessing child anxiety and abdominal pain severity, recall of provider communication about causes of abdominal pain and recommendations for intervention, their own causal beliefs about pain, and perceived acceptability of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and standard medical treatment (SMT) after reading descriptions of each treatment. Providers completed a questionnaire assessing their perceptions and communication about the causes of the child's abdominal pain and perceived acceptability of CBT.; Results: Provider communication about psychosocial causes and interventions was reported infrequently by parents, children, and providers. Parents rated psychosocial causes for abdominal pain as less likely than physical causes, and children and parents rated CBT as less acceptable than SMT. Parents' recall of provider communication about psychosocial causes was associated with their own causal beliefs about pain and their perceived acceptability of CBT. Children's and parents' recall of provider recommendations for psychosocial intervention was associated with their perceived acceptability of CBT.; Conclusion: Results highlight the importance of provider communication about psychosocial contributors to abdominal pain and psychosocial interventions for children with FGIDs. Medical and mental health providers can partner to deliver care to children with FGIDs using a biopsychosocial approach.},

Abstract = {Trajectories of illness and recovery are ongoing and incomplete processes cocreated by individuals, their informal support networks, formal care-givers and treatment contexts, and broader social systems. This analysis presents two case histories of care-seeking for, and recovery from, mental illness and psychosocial problems in the context of protracted internal displacement. These case histories present individuals with experiences of schizophrenia and depression drawn from a sample of adult long-term internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Georgia, a country in the South Caucasus. Dimensions of care-seeking were compiled into a matrix for analysis. Interviews were open coded, and codes were linked with matrix dimensions to construct each case history. Findings illustrated that individuals moved cyclically among self-care, household support, lay care, and formal services domains to understand and manage their problems. Living with mental illness and within displacement are experiences that intersect at various points, including in the recognition and perceived causes of illness, stressors such as discrimination and isolation, the affordability and availability of services, and the capacity of social networks to provide informal care. Interventions are needed to support informal care-givers and build lay referral networks, as well as to identify intervention points within care-seeking processes. Interventions that target the mental health needs of displaced persons have the potential to contribute to the development of an innovative community mental health care system in Georgia.

Abstract = {Mental illness (MI) affects one in four people in their lifetime and a failure to seek help for MI can have grave consequences. To decrease stigma and increase help seeking, prior campaigns have promoted the biological origins of MI. Even though some research supports the efficacy of this approach, other research does not. We propose cultural differences as a partial explanation for these inconsistent results. The current study assessed ethnic differences in the relationship between perceived causes of MI, shame associated with MI and perceived family support for help seeking. White and South Asian American (SAA) undergraduate students completed an online survey (n = 177). Results indicated that SAAs were significantly more likely than whites to perceive character deficits as the cause of MI. Further, among those who had sought help for MI, ethnic differences emerged in perceptions of MI based on perceived cause. SAAs who believed that MI had biological origins perceived more shame and less family support for seeking help compared to SAAs who believed MI was due to character deficits. The converse was true for whites—those who believed that MI had biological origins perceived less shame and more family support for help seeking compared to whites who believed MI was due to character deficits. The results of the current study illuminate the role that culture plays in perceptions of MI. Further, these results have implications for interventions targeting South Asian populations and for mental health outreach in general. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study examined experiences and explanations of depression amongst Xhosa-speaking pregnant women, mothers, and health workers in an urban township in Cape Town, South Africa. The study was conducted as part of formative research for a randomised controlled trial to develop and evaluate a task-sharing counselling intervention for maternal depression in this setting. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 12 depressed and 9 nondepressed pregnant women and mothers of young babies, and 13 health care providers. We employed an in-depth framework analysis approach to explore the idioms, descriptions, and perceived causes of depression particular to these women, and compared these with the ICD-10 and DSM-5 criteria for major depression. We found that symptoms of major depression are similar in this township to those described in international criteria (withdrawal, sadness, and poor concentration), but that local descriptions of these symptoms vary. In addition, all the symptoms described by participants were directly related to stressors occurring in the women’s lives. These stressors included poverty, unemployment, lack of support from partners, abuse, and death of loved ones, and were exacerbated by unwanted or unplanned pregnancies and the discovery of HIV positive status at antenatal appointments. The study calls attention to the need for specifically designed counselling interventions for perinatal depression that are responsive to the lived experiences of these women and grounded in the broader context of poor socioeconomic conditions and living environments in South Africa, all of which have a direct impact on mental health.

Abstract = {Many individuals suffering from psychological disorders do not receive professional help, partly due to the highly stigmatizing nature of mental illness. The current research examined whether the informational model of mental illness, specifically perceived causal attributions and treatability, impacts stigma and willingness to seek professional help. The results indicate that biological attributions, regardless of the presence or absence of treatability information, can reduce stereotypes about the mentally ill, lower help-seeking stigma, and increase willingness to seek a psychiatrist, compared to psychosocial attributions. The decrease in help-seeking stigma accounts for the effect of attributions on willingness to seek help. Furthermore, an individual’s mental health history interacts with the type of informational model to impact the likelihood of managing symptoms on one’s own without professional help.

Abstract = {This study aimed to examine the associations between beliefs about the causes of depression and schizophrenia and stigmatizing attitudes towards people with these disorders. In 2013, a web-based survey was carried out with 1,000 Japanese adults. Participants were presented with a case vignette describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia, or chronic schizophrenia and asked about their beliefs about the causes of these disorders and also about their personally-held stigmatizing attitudes, stigmatizing attitudes perceived in others, and the desire for social distance from the person described in the vignette. The results suggested that perceived stigma was significantly associated with several biogenetic, psychosocial, and personality explanations for both depression and schizophrenia. When respondents believed that psychosocial factors caused depression, they were less likely to perceive them as weak rather than sick. Believing that depression and schizophrenia were caused by personality characteristics was associated with stronger personal beliefs about the ill person’s dangerousness and unpredictability. Future research could aim to examine the influence of personality-based causes of mental illnesses in greater detail. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Rapid growth and development in recent decades has seen mental health and mental illness emerge as priority health concerns for the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). As a result, mental health services in the region are being redefined and expanded. However, there is a paucity of local research to guide ongoing service development. Local research is important because service users' experience of mental illness and mental health services are linked to their sociocultural context. In order for service development to be most effective, there is a need for increased understanding of the people who use these services.This article aims to review and synthesize mental health research from the Gulf Cooperation Council. It also seeks to identify gaps in the literature and suggest directions for future research. A scoping framework was used to conduct this review. To identify studies, database searches were undertaken, regional journals were hand-searched, and reference lists of included articles were examined. Empirical studies undertaken in the Gulf Cooperation Council that reported mental health service users' experience of mental illness were included. Framework analysis was used to synthesize results. Fifty-five studies met inclusion criteria and the following themes were identified: service preferences, illness (symptomology, perceived cause, impact), and recovery (traditional healing, family support, religion). Gaps included contradictory findings related to the supportive role of the Arabic extended family and religion, under-representation of women in study samples, and limited attention on illness management outside of the hospital setting.From this review, it is clear that the sociocultural context in the region is linked to service users' experience of mental illness. Future research that aims to fill the identified gaps and develop and test culturally appropriate interventions will aid practice and policy development in the region.},

Abstract = {Evidence on mental illness stigma abounds yet little is known about public perceptions of intellectual disability. This study examined causal beliefs about intellectual disability and schizophrenia and how these relate to awareness of the condition and social distance. UK lay people aged 16 + (N = 1752), in response to vignettes depicting intellectual disability and schizophrenia, noted their interpretation of the difficulties, and rated their agreement with 22 causal and four social distance items. They were most likely to endorse environmental causes for intellectual disability, and biomedical factors, trauma and early disadvantage for schizophrenia. Accurate identification of both vignettes was associated with stronger endorsement of biomedical causes, alongside weaker endorsement of adversity, environmental and supernatural causes. Biomedical causal beliefs and social distance were negatively correlated for intellectual disability, but not for schizophrenia. Causal beliefs mediated the relationship between identification of the condition and social distance for both conditions. While all four types of causal beliefs acted as mediators for intellectual disability, for schizophrenia only supernatural causal beliefs did. Educating the public and promoting certain causal beliefs may be of benefit in tackling intellectual disability stigma, but for schizophrenia, other than tackling supernatural attributions, may be of little benefit in reducing stigma.

Abstract = {Aims: We investigate reasons for persistent medication refusal in schizophrenia spectrum disorders and test whether factors that speak for a rational decision, such as negative experiences with medication or low symptom distress predict medication refusal, even after taking differences in insight into account. Method: We included 45 participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, of which 20 had refused antipsychotic medication for at least three months and assessed reasons for taking or not taking medication, labeling condition as mental disorder ('insight'), experiences with the previous treatments, symptoms and symptom distress, positive and negative consequences and experiences of psychosis, causal beliefs, therapeutic relationships with previous clinicians and attitudes towards medication. Results: Groups did not differ in symptom severity but medication refusers reported significantly less insight, less satisfaction with their most-recent psychiatrist and with previous medication, and more negative beliefs about harmful effects of medication. They also felt less informed about medication. After controlling for insight, the perceived helpfulness of the previous treating psychiatrist (OR = 0.30, z = 5.58, p = 0.018) and of previous medication (OR = 0.27, z = 6.87, p = 0.009) and feeling insufficiently informed about medication (OR = 0.53, z = 3.85, p = 0.050) significantly predicted medication discontinuation. Conclusions: Building rapport with patients with a different view of the nature of their condition and encouraging informed decisions on medication are likely to improve medication adherence. However, the findings also suggest that refusing medication after a phase of initial adherence is also the consequence of negative experiences with medication and could result from weighing the pros against the cons.

Abstract = {Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has primarily pediatric onset and well-documented unique impacts on family functioning. Limited research has assessed the understanding that parents of children with OCD have of the etiology of the condition, and there are no data regarding potential applications of genetic counseling for this population. We recruited 13 parents of 13 children diagnosed with OCD from the OCD Registry at British Columbia Children’s Hospital, and conducted qualitative semi-structured telephone interviews to explore participants’ experiences with their child’s OCD, causal attributions of OCD, and perceptions of two genetic counseling vignettes. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using elements of grounded theory qualitative methodology. Analysis revealed key components and contextual elements of the process through which parents adapt to their child’s OCD. This adaptation process involved conceptualizing the meaning of OCD, navigating its impact on family dynamics, and developing effective illness management strategies. Adaptation took place against a backdrop of stigmatization and was shaped by participants’ family history of mental illness and their child’s specific manifestations of OCD. Parents perceived genetic counseling, as described in the vignettes, as being empowering, alleviating guilt and blame, and positively impacting treatment orientation. These data provide insight into the process of parental adaptation to pediatric OCD, and suggest that genetic counseling services for families affected by OCD may help facilitate adaptation to this illness.

Abstract = {In this longitudinal study, attributional and social processes involved in symptoms of mental health problems (depressive symptoms and aggressive behavior) were identified by investigating anxious and angry rejection sensitivity (RS), causal attributions of self-blame and peer-blame, and responses to rejection threat of withdrawal and retribution. Young adolescents (N = 713, grades 5–7) completed questionnaires three times in their regular classrooms over 14 months. Participants who reported more self-blame for rejection were more likely to withdraw in response to rejection threat, and withdrawal and anxious RS were associated with increased depressive symptoms at T3 relative to T1. In contrast, adolescents higher in the angry form of RS and who reported more peer-blame for rejection were more likely to seek retribution, which in turn was associated with more overt/relational aggressive behavior at T3 relative to T1. Depressive symptom level measured at T1 also was associated with later RS and coping with withdrawal, and aggressive behavior at T1 was associated with later retribution. Sex of the participants did not moderate any longitudinal associations, and only one prospective path, from T1 depressive symptoms to T2 RS anxious, was moderated by age.

Abstract = {Clergy have historically provided ‘healing’ through various spiritual and medical modalities and even in modern, developed welfare economies they may still be an important help-seeking resource. Partnerships between religion and psychiatry are regularly advocated, but there is scant research on clergy explanatory models of illness. This paper aimed to explore their relationship with psychiatry and to examine how clergy in various faith groups conceptualised mental health problems. In this qualitative study using in-depth interviews, these issues were explored with 32 practising clergy in the UK from a range of different Christian, Muslim and Jewish faith organisations and ethnic backgrounds. This paper presents findings related to clergy explanatory models of mental illness and, in particular, how the social factors involved in causation are tinged with spiritual influences and implications, and how the meanings of mental distress assume a social and moral significance in distinctive localised matters.

Abstract = {Objectives: Rapid advances in genetic research and increased use of genetic testing have increased the emphasis on genetic causes of epilepsy in patient encounters. Research in other disorders suggests that genetic causal attributions can influence patients’ psychological responses and coping strategies, but little is known about how epilepsy patients and their relatives will respond to genetic attributions of epilepsy. We investigated the possibility that among members of families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy, depression, the most frequent psychiatric comorbidity in the epilepsies, might be related to the perception that epilepsy has a genetic cause. Methods: A self-administered survey was completed by 417 individuals in 104 families averaging 4 individuals with epilepsy per family. Current depression was measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire. Genetic causal attribution was assessed by three questions addressing the following: perceived likelihood of having an epilepsy-related mutation, perceived role of genetics in causing epilepsy in the family, and (in individuals with epilepsy) perceived influence of genetics in causing the individual’s epilepsy. Relatives without epilepsy were asked about their perceived chance of developing epilepsy in the future, compared with the average person. Results: Prevalence of current depression was 14.8% in 182 individuals with epilepsy, 6.5% in 184 biologic relatives without epilepsy, and 3.9% in 51 individuals married into the families. Among individuals with epilepsy, depression was unrelated to genetic attribution. Among biologic relatives without epilepsy, however, prevalence of depression increased with increasing perceived chance of having an epilepsy-related mutation (p = 0.02). This association was not mediated by perceived future epilepsy risk among relatives without epilepsy. Significance: Depression is associated with perceived likelihood of carrying an epilepsy-related mutation among individuals without epilepsy in families containing multiple affected individuals. This association should be considered when addressing mental health issues in such families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Mental health literacy is the beliefs and knowledge about mental health issues and their remedies. Attitudes and beliefs of lay individuals about mental illness are shaped by personal knowledge about mental illness, knowing and interacting with someone living with mental illness, and cultural stereotypes. Mental health issues are increasing and are alarming in almost every part of the world, and hence compiling this review provides an opportunity to understand the different views regarding mental disorders and problems as well as to fill the gap in the published literature by focusing only on the belief system and perception of mental health problems among general population. Method: The methodology involved a systematic review and the meta-synthesis method, which includes synthesizing published qualitative studies on mental health perception and beliefs. Sample: Fifteen relevant published qualitative and mixed-method studies, regarding the concept of mental health, were identified for meta-synthesis. Analysis: All the themes of the selected studies were further analyzed to give a broader picture of mental health problems and their perceived causes and management. Only qualitative studies, not older than 2010, focusing on beliefs about, attitudes toward, and perceptions of mental health problems, causes, and treatments were included in this review. Results: The findings are divided into four major categories, namely, 1) symptoms of mental health issues, 2) description of mental health issues, 3) perceived causes, and 4) preferred treatment and help-seeking behavior. Each category contains themes and subthemes based on published studies. Conclusion: The findings reveal multiple causes of, descriptions of, and treatment options for mental health problems, thereby providing insight into different help-seeking behaviors. Clarity is offered by highlighting cultural differences and similarities in mental health beliefs and perceptions about the causes of mental health problems. The implications of the studies and recommendations based on current findings are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Even though our knowledge of the cause of disease and disability has grown, stigma still exists. Weiner, Perry, and Magnusson’s seminal study on attributions of stigma has been cited over 500 times since its publication in 1988. The current research sought to replicate and expand this literature in 2 studies. We used the 10 stigmata from the original study and we added 6 more (representing common psychological and physical stigmata). In the first study, we examined the classification of stigmata using cluster analysis. We found that instead of dichotomizing stigmata into either psychological or physical, attributions of controllability and stability together resulted in 4 distinct clusters. Although these were mostly consistent with past literature, the fourth cluster included both psychological and physical stigmata and was rated as moderately controllable and moderately stable. In the second study, we examined how information about responsibility shifts causal attributions, emotional responses, and helping behaviors. Information that an individual was responsible for their stigma led to greater attributions of controllability, less positive emotions, and less help compared with information that an individual was not responsible. More interestingly, the no-information control condition was similar to the responsibility information condition for stigmata that fell into the controllable clusters, whereas the control condition was similar to the not responsible information condition for stigmata that fell into the uncontrollable clusters. While parsimony is valued, the psychological/physical dichotomy is not nuanced enough to fully capture the variation in stigmata, which, in turn, has implications for future research on stigma reduction.

Seventy-one participants drawn from three mosques in Harare responded to self-administered questionnaires, which assessed their knowledge on causes, signs and symptoms as well as the treatment of mental illness. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Respondents defined mental illness within the social, spiritual and medical realms. The main perceived causes of mental illness were evil spirits (66%) and stress (62%). Treatment methods included medication (68%), prayer (66%) and Quranic verse recitations (64%). Both modern medicine and religious methods emerged as important in managing mental illness which suggests the need for a multi-sectoral approach.

Abstract = {Background: In order to facilitate case identification of incident (untreated and recent onset) cases of psychosis and controls in three sites in India, Nigeria and Trinidad, we sought to understand how psychoses (or madness) were conceptualized locally. The evidence we gathered also contributes to a long history of research on concepts of madness in diverse settings. Methods: We conducted focus group discussions and individual interviews to collect information about how informants in each site make sense of and respond to madness. A coding framework was developed and analyses of transcripts from the FGDs and interviews were conducted. Results: Analyses suggest the following: a) disturbed behaviors are the primary sign of madness; b) madness is attributed to a wide range of causes; and, c) responses to madness are dictated by cultural and pragmatic factors. These findings are congruent with similar research that has been conducted over the past 50 years. Conclusions: The INTREPID research suggests that concepts about madness share similar features across diverse settings: a) terms for madness are often derived from a common understanding that involves disruptions in mental processes and capacities; b) madness is recognized mostly by disruptive behaviours or marked declines in functioning; c) causal attributions are varied; and, d) help-seeking is a complex process.

Abstract = {Human behavior is frequently described both in abstract, general terms and in concrete, specific terms. We asked whether these two ways of framing equivalent behaviors shift the inferences people make about the biological and psychological bases of those behaviors. In five experiments, we manipulated whether behaviors are presented concretely (i.e. with reference to a specific person, instantiated in the particular context of that person's life) or abstractly (i.e. with reference to a category of people or behaviors across generalized contexts). People judged concretely framed behaviors to be less biologically based and, on some dimensions, more psychologically based than the same behaviors framed in the abstract. These findings held true for both mental disorders (Experiments 1 and 2) and everyday behaviors (Experiments 4 and 5), and yielded downstream consequences for the perceived efficacy of disorder treatments (Experiment 3). Implications for science educators, students of science, and members of the lay public are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, we summarize the findings of time-trend studies that largely meet these methodological requirements. They are mostly from Western industrialized countries and provide a fairly consistent picture of time trends of mental health related attitudes. However, since attitude research in other cultures and less developed countries has mostly started later and is still developing, the evolution of stigma in many parts of the world remains unknown. We will look at how causal beliefs regarding mental illness have changed and how the image of psychiatry and psychiatric treatment has evolved. Then we will evaluate how the public stigma and the perceived stigma of mental illness have changed over the last 30 years and whether there are indications for changes in structural stigma.

Abstract = {The causal beliefs which adults have regarding their mental health difficulties have been linked to help-seeking behaviour, treatment preferences, and the outcome of therapy; yet, the topic remains a relatively unexplored one in the adolescent literature. This exploratory study aims to explore the causal beliefs regarding depression among a sample of clinically referred adolescents. Seventy seven adolescents, aged between 11 and 17, all diagnosed with moderate to severe depression, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule, at the beginning of their participation in a randomised controlled trial. Data were analysed qualitatively using framework analysis. The study identified three themes related to causal beliefs: (1) bewilderment about why they were depressed; (2) depression as a result of rejection, victimisation, and stress; and (3) something inside is to blame. Although some adolescents struggled to identify the causes of their depression, many identified stressful life experiences as the cause of their current depression. They also tended to emphasise their own negative ways of interpreting those events, and some believed that their depression was caused by something inside them. Adolescents’ causal beliefs are likely to have implications for the way they seek help and engage in treatment, making it important to understand how adolescents understand their difficulties.

Abstract = {Mental illness continues to be stigmatized by those in the general population, including diagnoses such as schizophrenia. These individuals tend to be seen as dangerous, unreliable, and are perceived to have a poor prognosis, which is correlated with a desire for social distance (Griffiths et al., 2006; Angermeyer & Matschinger, 2003; Angermeyer et al., 2003). Research literature has shown that the most effective stigma-reduction strategy to date is direct contact between individuals from the general population and those from the stigmatized group (Corrigan et al., 2012). Although effective, it is not always feasible due to a variety of constraints such as ability or willingness of individuals to engage in contact. Therefore, this study proposed an alternative option: the hallucination simulation video. Participants were assigned to one of three groups: simulated experience, written description, or a control condition. Each group was provided with a different intervention, and then all participants were asked to complete measures designed to gauge their attitudes on a variety of variables. There were no significant differences found between groups regarding levels of empathy, desire for social distance, causal attributions of the illness, or perceived dangerousness. Although the written description group endorsed higher levels of emotional discomfort, this did not seem to affect other attitudes such as empathy or desire for social distance. Potential explanations and implications are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Rationale: Undocumented Mexican immigrants (UMIs) and their families make up a considerable proportion of the United States (U.S.) population at-risk for psychological distress. Yet, research to inform the mental health of UMIs is scant and existing studies often lack scientific rigor. This study used the Socio-Ecologic Framework and the Minority Stress Model, as well as context-sensitive methodology and Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) to identify the prevalence of psychological distress, mental health disorders, and relevant Cultural and Contextual Concepts of Distress, among UMIs living in high-risk neighborhoods near the California-Mexico border region. Design: This study was a multi-stage project that included formative research, pilot testing, and a cross-sectional study that used Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) as a sampling and data analysis methodology. Data for the RDS study was obtained from clinical interviews with 248 UMI adults of Mexican origin residing in North San Diego County. Primary mental health outcome measures included the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-53), and the Bradford Symptom Inventory (aBSI). An adapted version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) 5th Edition Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) was used for the assessment of Cultural and Contextual Concepts of Distress. Results: Overall, 41% of UMIs met criteria for clinically significant psychological distress, with significant differences found for sex, age, and marital status. Additionally, 22% of UMIs met criteria for one or more mental health disorder based on DSM diagnosis, with the most prevalent disorders being Major Depressive Disorder (MDD: 14%) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD: 7%). Pertaining to Cultural Concepts of Distress, 24% of UMIs reported a lifetime prevalence of Nervios and 12% reported a lifetime prevalence of Ataque de Nervios, with the most common causal attributions for Nervios and Ataque de Nervios being family conflict (20%). Moreover, 82% of UMIs reported experiencing significant distress as a result of their undocumented status, which was found to be associated with significant migration-related loss, clinically significant psychological and somatic symptoms, and a negative effect on identity and self-esteem. Conclusions: UMIs are a population at risk of psychological distress given the multiple contextual stressors that these immigrants face. Debates on programs and policies pertaining to UMIs are complex and multifaceted, and divisiveness on immigration and welfare reform in the U.S. is long-standing. Tenacious grassroots efforts, both, in Mexico and in the U.S., are necessary to influence policy aimed to allocate funding to increase access to culturally and contextually responsive interventions aimed to address the complex mental health needs of this vulnerable population. It is the responsibility of both Mexico and the U.S. to work collaboratively in the development of programs and policies to prevent the negative consequences of inadequate access and to protect the human rights of Mexican immigrants looking for more promising futures.

Abstract = {How is the human brain shaped by our sociocultural experiences? What neural correlates underlie the extraordinary cultural diversity of human behavior? How do our genes interact with sociocultural experiences to moderate human brain functional organization and behavior? The Sociocultural Brain provides a new perspective on human brain functional organization, highlighting the role of human sociocultural experience and its interaction with genes in shaping the human brain and behavior. Drawing on cutting edge research from the burgeoning field of cultural neuroscience, it reveals the cross-cultural differences in human brain activity that underlie a multitude of cognitive and affective processes, including visual perception/attention, memory, causal attribution, inference of others' mental states, self-reflection, and empathy. In addition, it presents studies that integrate brain imaging and cultural priming to explore the causal relationship between culture and brain functional organization. The book ends with a discussion of the implications of cultural neuroscience findings for understanding the nature of the human brain and culture, as well as the implications for education, cross-cultural communication and conflict, and the clinical treatment of mental disorders.

Abstract = {Background: Major depression is highly prevalent and disabling mental health condition. Antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are two of the most effective and widely used treatments for depression. Some research suggests that various causal attributions for depression may differentially effect treatment specific credibility and outcome expectancy. Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of biological and cognitive behavioral explanations on treatment credibility, outcome expectancy, and intentions to initiate antidepressant medication and CBT among a sample of participants meeting criteria for a current major depressive episode. Methods: The sample (N = 157) was recruited using Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd sourcing marketplace. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three active conditions describing their symptoms as being caused by biological, cognitive behavioral, multi-causal (combination of biological and cognitive behavioral), or a no-information control group. Next, participants read descriptions of antidepressant medication and CBT treatments. Following each description, participants completed measures of treatment credibility, outcome expectancy, and intention to initiate the treatment. Three separate 2 (antidepressant medication vs. CBT) x 4 (biological, cognitive behavioral, multi-causal, or no-information control) mixed model ANOVAs and a series of planned contrasts were used to examine group differences. Results: Treatment credibility was significantly greater in the CBT condition compared to the antidepressant medication condition, p = .007, across all explanatory conditions. However, there were no other significant main-effects of treatment condition or explanatory condition on treatment credibility, expectancy, of willingness to initiate treatment. Similarly, the interaction of treatment and explanatory conditions did not significantly predict treatment credibility, expectancy, or intention to initiate treatment, all p's > .05. Planned contrasts showed no significant differences in causal explanatory condition treatment credibility, expectancy, or willingness to initiate treatment for antidepressant medication or CBT, all p's > .05. Conclusion: Causal explanations had no impact on treatment credibility, outcome expectancy, or willingness to initiate either treatment for depression. Overall, participants reported very low willingness to initiate treatment for their depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of causal attributions on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) literacy outcomes. Adult participants (N = 644) resided in the United States and completed an online questionnaire through Amazon Mechanical Turk. The vignette study design was 3 (trauma type: military combat versus accident versus rape) x 2 (vignette character gender: male versus female) x 2 (participant gender: male versus female). It was hypothesized that PTSD literacy outcomes would be greatest for the military condition, followed by accident, followed by rape. Female participants were expected to have greater PTSD literacy than males. All participants were expected to recommend female vignette characters seek psychological help more than male characters. It was also hypothesized that blame would differ among trauma types and that anger and pity would mediate the relationships between blame and PTSD literacy attitudinal outcomes. The hypotheses were partially supported. Overall, the results reflected high levels of PTSD literacy in this sample. Personal mental health experience predicted greater PTSD literacy. Participants randomized to the military condition recognized that the vignettes depicted a mental health problem and PTSD with greater frequency than those in the other conditions. Participants in the rape condition recommended the vignette characters seek psychological help more than those in the other conditions. Compared to male participants, females indicated that the vignettes depicted more serious problems in functioning. There was a lack of findings for vignette character gender. No differences in character blame were found; thus, attribution theory was not supported as the explanatory mechanism for differences in PTSD literacy across conditions. However, anger and pity fully mediated the relationships between blame and willingness to help the character and blame and avoidance of the character regardless of condition; attribution theory was supported in this regard. Also, pity fully mediated the relationships between blame and degree of problem and blame and helpfulness of treatment. Future research should examine how other attributional biases may account for PTSD literacy differences among trauma types. Findings can be used to help training programs target populations low in PTSD literacy and highlight the effects of emotional reactions to PTSD on helping behaviors.

Abstract = {A significant number of youth experience mental health disorders for which they suffer negative consequences. Although there are evidence-based therapies available to help children and their families, most youth do not receive treatment. Parental problem recognition is likely a primary barrier in this process. This study begins to address why parents may have difficulty recognizing mental health problems by extending existing models and integrating evidence about parental perceptions. Specifically, the study aimed to investigate the relationship between parental attributions and parents' problem determination, and to examine the influence that parental characteristics have on this judgment process. Participants included 164 parents of youth ages 6-11 years. Purposive sampling was used to recruit mothers and fathers from both lower and higher SES communities. Parents completed self-report measures of parental characteristics, including: parental psychopathology, parenting stress, parental tolerance, and parental self-efficacy. Parents read ten brief child behavior vignettes and completed a version of the Written Analogue Questionnaire to rate the cause of each behavior (assuming it was their own child in the vignette) along four dimensions. Parents also rated the extent to which the behavior was seen as a problem. Results indicated that parents' causal attributions were highly associated with parents' problem ratings, and the attributions of stability and controllability were particularly robust predictors of problem determination. Hypotheses regarding parental characteristics as moderators of the relationship between attributions and problem determination were not supported. Findings are discussed in light of clinical and public health implications; results suggest that recognizing the influence of parental beliefs and attributions may help to increase the efficacy of outreach efforts for early intervention and help seeking for parental concerns.

Abstract = {Objective: Implicit theories of personality are a class of beliefs about the fixedness or malleability of human personality traits (Chiu, Hong, & Dweck, 1997). This study examined how Americans' endorsement of an implicit theory of personality influenced their beliefs about mental illness and mental health treatment preferences. Method : One hundred and twenty (120) American residents completed an online survey in which they completed a measure of their implicit theory of personality, read a vignette about a neutral target stimulus evidencing symptoms of mental illness, then completed measures of stigmatization of mental illness, causal beliefs about mental illness, mental health treatment preferences, prognosis beliefs about mental illness, and genetic determinism beliefs about mental illness. Results: Eighty-nine (89%) of participants could be categorized as either endorsing an entity or incremental theory of personality. Participants who endorsed an entity theory of personality were less optimistic about the prognosis of the target stimulus' mental illness and were more likely to endorse the belief that the target stimulus' mental illness was caused by heredity. Conclusions: Americans have fundamental beliefs regarding the fixedness or malleability of personality and can be relatively easily categorized as falling into one of two 'camps' regarding these beliefs. Implicit theories of personality influence beliefs about mental illness and mental health treatment in that the degree to which a person believes personality is fixed appears to carry over to the extent to which they believe mental illness is fixed. Implications for clinical work and psychoeducation about mental illness and mental health treatment are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Patients' causal beliefs about their mental disorders are important for treatment because they affect illness-related behaviours. However, there are few studies exploring patients' causal beliefs about their mental disorder. Objectives: (a) To qualitatively explore patients' causal beliefs of their mental disorder, (b) to explore frequencies of patients stating causal beliefs, and (c) to investigate differences of causal beliefs according to patients' primary diagnoses. Method: Inpatients in psychosomatic rehabilitation were asked an open-ended question about their three most important causal beliefs about their mental illness. Answers were obtained from 678 patients, with primary diagnoses of depression (N = 341), adjustment disorder (N = 75), reaction to severe stress (N = 57) and anxiety disorders (N = 40). Two researchers developed a category system inductively and categorised the reported causal beliefs. Qualitative analysis has been supplemented by logistic regression analyses. Results: The causal beliefs were organized into twelve content-related categories. Causal beliefs referring to 'problems at work' (47%) and 'problems in social environment' (46%) were most frequently mentioned by patients with mental disorders. 35% of patients indicate causal beliefs related to 'self/internal states'. Patients with depression and patients with anxiety disorders stated similar causal beliefs, whereas patients with reactions to severe stress and adjustment disorders stated different causal beliefs in comparison to patients with depression. Limitations: There was no opportunity for further exploration, because we analysed written documents. Conclusions: These results add a detailed insight to mentally ill patients' causal beliefs to illness perception literature. Additionally, evidence about differences in frequencies of causal beliefs between different illness groups complement previous findings. For future research it is important to clarify the relation between patients' causal beliefs and the chosen treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A pilot study and two intensive studies were conducted to document the local vocabularies used by Burundians to describe mental health problems and their understandings about the causes. The pilot study—in which 14 different large groups of community members awaiting appointments at a village health clinic were engaged in open-ended discussions of the local terminology and causal beliefs about mental health problems—suggested three key syndromes: akabonge (a set of depression-like symptoms), guhahamuka (a set of trauma-related symptoms), and ibisigo (a set of psychosis-like symptoms). In Study 1 (N = 542), individual interviews or surveys presented participants with the names of these syndromes and asked what they considered to be the symptoms and causes of them. Study 2 (N = 143) cross-validated these terms with a different sample (also in individual interviews/surveys), by presenting the symptom clusters and asking what each would be called and about their causes. Findings of both studies validated this set of terms and yielded a rich body of data about causal beliefs. The influence of education level and gender on familiarity with these terms was also assessed.

Abstract = {In Uganda, depression is a growing concern, yet mental health professionals are in short supply, and help is often sought from traditional healers. To develop an integrated system of care, we must understand sociocultural aspects of depression including beliefs about help seeking and treatment. In a mixed methods study, we used semi-structured interviews and self-report measures to assess depressed patients (N = 30) seeking treatment in traditional healing (n = 15) and psychiatry clinics (n = 15) near Kampala, Uganda. We assessed demographics, symptoms, treatment characteristics, and explanatory models (EMs) of depression (e.g., labeling the problem, cause, impact on life, best type of treatment). We predicted differences across treatment settings. To further explore EMs, we assessed differences in EMs of patients and their providers by interviewing patient–provider dyads (n = 8 dyads). Patients in both settings were similar in demographics, symptoms, perceived cause, seriousness, and impact of depression. However, patients at traditional clinics were more likely to desire herbal remedies, while those in psychiatry clinics were more likely to desire modern medication. Patient–provider dyads also had different treatment beliefs, with patients desiring financial assistance, social support, and medication, and providers more likely to suggest counseling or advice. The study highlights the need to understand diverse beliefs and treatment trajectories in a multicultural context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Findings suggest that the way an individual understands their experiences has important consequences on subsequent health behaviour. One aspect of an individual’s understanding is what they believe has caused their experiences. This has been associated with treatment outcome and attitudes towards mental health problems. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the impact of causal beliefs on treatment outcome and stigma in people experiencing psychosis. Three main databases were searched and 21 articles that investigated various aspects of treatment outcome, and stigma in relation to causal beliefs was included in the review. Overall, there were a small number of replicated findings which limits the interpretation of results. There is an indication that causal explanations are associated with various treatment outcomes, including attitudes towards treatment and satisfaction with therapeutic relationships as well as internalized stigma. Spiritual beliefs appeared to be adopted as a coping mechanism and a way to reduce stigma but did not appear to be associated with treatment outcome. Individuals with psychosis do appear to develop causal beliefs that may be associated with engagement with services and treatment, as well as impacting on their attitudes towards themselves and others with mental illness. This may have important implications for clinical practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Causal attributions of mental health problems play a crucial role in shaping and differentiating illness experience in different sociocultural and ethnic groups. The aims of this study were (a) to analyze older Somali refugees’ causal attributions of mental health problems; (b) to examine the associations between demographic and diagnostic characteristics, proxy indicators of acculturation, and causal attributions; and (c) to analyze the connections between causal attributions and the manifestation of somatic-affective and cognitive depressive symptoms. A sample of 128 Somali refugees aged 50–80 years living in Finland were asked to list the top three causes of mental health problems. Depressive symptoms were analyzed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The results showed that the most commonly endorsed causal attributions of mental health problems were jinn, jealousy related to polygamous relationships, and various life problems. We identified five attribution categories: (a) somatic, (b) interpersonal, (c) psychological, (d) life experiences, and (e) religious causes. The most common causal attribution categories were life experiences and interpersonal causes of mental health problems. Men tended to attribute mental health problems to somatic and psychological causes, and women to interpersonal and religious causes. Age and proxy indicators of acculturation were not associated with causal attributions. Participants with a psychiatric diagnosis and/or treatment history reported more somatic and psychological attributions than other participants. Finally, those who attributed mental health problems to life experiences (e.g., war) reported marginally fewer cognitive depressive symptoms (e.g., guilt) than those who did not. The results are discussed in relation to biomedical models of mental health, service use, immigration experiences, and culturally relevant patterns of symptom manifestation.

Abstract = {Objectives: To establish the prevalence and correlates of continuum beliefs for five mental illnesses in a multiethnic population and to explore its association with stigma.; Design: A community-based, cross-sectional study.; Setting: A national study in a multiethnic Asian country.; Participants: A comprehensive study of 3006 Singapore residents (Singapore citizens and permanent residents) aged 18-65 years who were living in Singapore at the time of the survey.; Outcome Measures: Parameters assessed included belief in a continuum of symptom experience, stigma dimensions and causal beliefs in mental illness. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression (MLR).; Results: About half of the population indicated agreement with a continuum of symptoms for depression (57.9%) and dementia (46.8%), whereas only about one in three respondents agreed with it for alcohol abuse (35.6%), schizophrenia (32.7%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (36.8%). MLR analyses revealed that students (β=0.28; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.50; p=0.018) and those who were unemployed (β=0.60; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.95; p=0.001) (vs employed) as well as those who had previous contact with people with mental illness (β = 0.31; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.45; p<0.001) and believed stress, family arguments, difficulties at work or financial difficulties to be a cause for mental illness (β=0.43; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.73; p=0.005) were associated with a higher belief in a continuum of symptom experience. Continuum beliefs were related to lower desire for social distance in alcohol abuse, OCD and schizophrenia; however, they were associated with higher scores on 'weak-not-sick' stigma dimension in dementia and schizophrenia.; Conclusions: Perceiving that a person with a mental illness is similar to themselves may reduce social distancing by the public. Thus, the approach may lend itself well to public education aimed at reducing stigma. (© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Abstract = {We examine whether reporting on violent and terrorist acts committed in July 2016 by persons who, among other characteristics, were suspected to have mental health issues did impact on mental illness stigma, and whether any changes added to changes observed after the Germanwings plane crash in 2015. Three identical online surveys (in 2014, 2015 and 2016) were conducted among persons > 15 years old from an established market research panel in Germany (N = 2195). Participants answered questions about a woman ('Anne') with either depression or schizophrenia as described in an unlabeled vignette. In the 2016 survey (< 4 weeks after the attacks), we also elicited perceived causes of the violent incidents. Compared to 2014, the predicted probability to rate Anne as dangerous increased from 7% to 11%. Perceived unpredictability increased from 17% to 23%. Other stigma measures did not change significantly. No significant changes were visible between 2015 and 2016. Mental illness ranked third among the most important perceived causes for the attacks in 2016, after ‘religious beliefs’ and ‘being manipulated by others’. Overall, the observed attitude changes were small. We discuss how the context of the attacks may have prevented further attitude change regarding persons with mental illness.

Abstract = {In addition to mental health literacy, several potentially conflicting emotions and attitudes among the public are hypothesized to guide their recommendations for specific mental health treatments. It is unclear whether evidence-based treatment strategies are guided by pro-social or stigmatizing attitudes and emotions. In a representative population survey in Germany (n = 3642), we asked respondents to what extent they would recommend psychotropic medication, psychotherapy and relaxation techniques for a person with mental illness described in an unlabelled vignette. For each treatment recommendation, we used multinomial logistic regression analyses to obtain predicted probabilities. Predictors comprised illness recognition, vignette condition, causal beliefs (current stress, childhood adversities, biogenetic), emotions (fear, anger, pro-social reactions), social distance, age, gender and education. Fear predicted greater probability for recommending psychotropic drugs in all investigated illnesses (p < 0.001), whereas associations of fear with recommending psychotherapy were generally lower and no associations with the recommendation for relaxation techniques were found. Anger was related to fewer recommendations for psychotherapy in all illnesses (p < 0.01). Pro-social reactions were predominantly related to the recommendation of relaxation techniques for a person with schizophrenia or major depression (p < 0.001). Higher desire for social distance predicted fewer recommendations for relaxation techniques in all three vignette conditions (p < 0.05). Our study corroborates findings that treatment recommendations are not necessarily linked to pro-social reactions or mental health literacy. The recommendation for a treatment modality like psychotropic medication or psychotherapy can be linked to underlying fear, possibly reflecting a public desire for protection against people with mental illness.

Abstract = {Objectives: Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) is known to challenge children's optimal development. This study sought to associate participants’ beliefs about IPV held during childhood with their adjustment as adults, and to compare their beliefs from childhood to their beliefs in early adulthood. Method: A nationally representative sample of 703 Swedish young adults reported on their past and present beliefs about the causes of their parents’ IPV. Standardized measures assessed their mental health (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress symptoms) and the quality of their relationships as adults. Results: The most common explanations for IPV were that the perpetrator suffered from physical or mental illness, had relationship problems, or was distressed. Participants were less likely to blame themselves for IPV or to believe that the perpetrator was cruel when they were adults, compared to their reports of themselves as children. Women were more likely to attribute mental or physical illness as the cause of the perpetrator's IPV. Childhood beliefs that the perpetrator was debilitated (from mental illness or substance abuse) and cruel (took pleasure in violence and/or despised the child) were associated with greater mental health problems and poorer relationship quality in adulthood. Conclusion: Evaluation of children's harmful beliefs about IPV could be useful in adapting intervention services aimed at ameliorating negative personal causal attributions.

Abstract = {The stigma associated with mental illness has several negative consequences for consumers (e.g., discrimination in employment and accommodation, reduced help-seeking, increased social isolation) and impacts their quality of life. Consumers’ beliefs around the causes of mental illness are thought to influence stigma and self-stigma. This study aims to investigate the types of causal beliefs consumers endorse about their own mental illness, mental illness in general, and consumers’ beliefs about causes endorsed by the public. Moreover, this study explores the impact that these beliefs have on factors that influence stigma and self-stigma. A thematic framework guided the analysis of semi-structured interviews with 23 consumers who self-identified as having mental illness. Consumers endorsed multiple causes simultaneously and causes differed between their own mental illness, thinking about mental illness in general, and the causal beliefs perceived to be held by the public. The majority of consumers thought that mental illness in general was caused by a combination of biogenetic, psychological, and environmental factors. Consumers endorsed fewer causal beliefs when considering their own mental illness, with all consumers stating that environmental factors contributed to their illness. Consumers thought that the public had a narrower range of causal beliefs and tended to think the public believed personal weakness/choice caused mental illness. Findings extend previous research and show that consumers’ causal beliefs may have an impact on several factors (e.g., control and management of illness, self-blame, feelings of responsibility, perceptions towards self) which are thought to influence treatment, recovery, and stigma.

Abstract = {Background: Previous evidence suggests that how an individual conceptualises the cause of a health problem can impact on subsequent perceptions and behaviour. Aims: This study explored the beliefs about the causes of psychosis in a group of mental health professionals. The study also sought to examine the relationship between causal beliefs and the perceived helpfulness of different treatments. Methods: A total of 219 clinicians completed a questionnaire about the provision of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and antipsychotic medication for their clients who were experiencing psychosis and their opinions about the helpfulness of these treatments. Causal beliefs were also assessed. Results and conclusions: Clients were twice as likely to be offered medication compared to CBT. Clinicians held a multifactorial model of aetiology, but were more likely to endorse psychosocial causes than biological factors. Clinicians with psychosocial beliefs were more likely to rate CBT as effective, whereas those with biological models were more likely to endorse the helpfulness of medication. Clinicians adopt a multi-causal approach when conceptualising the aetiology of psychosis and these beliefs were related to opinions about the helpfulness of treatment. Beliefs about the aetiology of their client’s experiences could blind clinicians to the benefits of offering different approaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Rape is a serious and growing problem of society in India. The elimination of violence against women remains one of the serious challenges especially in India as the prevalence of rape has exceed to a point where even children of five years of age are being tortured and raped. Furthermore, in most of the cases victims are tremendously facing taunts and torture instead of getting proper justice. In this male dominating society it is very important to identify the basic attitudes of men towards rape and the pattern of attitudes of them may lead us to access to the causes as well as prevention of rape. This body of work highlights the importance of studying attitudes held by the general public as findings suggest that societal views can have a significant negative impact on the mental health of victims. The aim of the study is to assess the variation of attitude among different age groups towards rape, perceived causes of rape and rationalisation of rape of male persons of society. It is also aimed to understand social desirability level and personality dimensions of participants can effectively influence their attitude across different age groups. A sample of male persons (n = 200) consisting of 4 groups classified according to their age in 15-25 years, 26-35 years, 36-45 years and 46-55 years were selected for the study. The variables attitude towards rape, perceived causes of rape and rationalisation of rape were assessed using Attitude Towards Rape Scale, Perceived Causes of Rape Scale and Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale respectively. To assess social desirability and personality dimension Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability Scale and Neo Five Factor Inventory were used respectively. From the result findings it may be observed that people of different age groups vary significantly in their attitude towards rape and social desirability level and openness dimension of personality also influence some aspects of attitude towards rape across different age groups of male persons.

Abstract = {Background: Few studies have been performed to explore mental health literacy and stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness and their relationships with causal beliefs about mental illness among Chinese people in Taiwan. Aims: Using a comparative approach, this study attempted to compare the mental health literacy and stigmatising attitudes of Taiwanese Chinese with those found among Australian and Japanese participants in other studies and to explore how mental health literacy and stigmatising attitudes relate to different perceptions of causes of mental illness. Methods: A convenience sample of 287 participants completed a battery of standardised questionnaires. Results: A much lower percentage of Taiwanese people than Australians could correctly identify depression and schizophrenia. The Taiwanese respondents rated psychiatrists and clinical psychologists as more helpful than social workers and general practitioners (GPs) and expressed more uncertainty about the usefulness of certain medications when compared to the Australian and Japanese samples. Interestingly, Taiwanese Chinese hold similarly high levels of stigma towards schizophrenia, but lower levels of stigma towards depression when compared to the Japanese respondents. Taiwanese respondents who have higher levels of mental health literacy about schizophrenia were less willing to interact with people with schizophrenia than those with lower levels of mental health literacy. Conclusion: This study underlines the need for public education programmes to improve knowledge of various mental illnesses and to reduce stigmatising attitudes among Taiwanese Chinese. The aforementioned socially and culturally driven beliefs must be taken into consideration so that culturally relevant education programmes can be developed.

Abstract = {Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a highly stigmatised condition, with treatment often involving multidisciplinary care. As such, understanding and comparing the attitudes of emerging mental health and medical professionals towards AN, within the content of sex-based differences, is pertinent to facilitate the development of targeted stigma interventions.; Aims: Examine the volitional stigmatisation of AN in emerging medical and mental health professionals.; Method: Participants (N = 126) were medical (n = 41) and psychology students (n = 85) who completed a range of attitudinal outcome measures (e.g. Causal Attributions Scale, Eating Disorder Stigma Scale, Opinions Scale, Characteristics Scale and Affective Reaction Scale).; Results: Across both disciplines, men were found to exhibit significantly higher eating disorder (ED) stigma, considered AN to be a more trivial and weak illness, and attributed greater levels of blame and responsibility to AN sufferers. Men also had significantly lower biogenetic causal attributions. Compared with psychology students, medicine students exhibited slightly greater anticipation of negative reactions in response to AN, obtained higher selfish/vain scores and considered sociocultural factors to contribute "a lot" in the development and maintenance of AN.; Conclusions: Overall, results indicate interventions aimed at improving ED mental health literacy are needed, specifically targeting males and potentially medical students.},

Abstract = {Background: Posttraumatic stress (PTS) results in significant distress or functional impairment. Prevalence studies report higher rates of PTS in forcibly displaced children (FDC). Current evidence deriving mainly from cross-sectional studies is unable to make causal attributions. Given rising rates of forcible displacement reported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2014, there is increasing need to determine the best policies and practice for engaging mental health needs of FDC. Methods: This systematic review identifies (1) longitudinal risk and protective factors and correlates for PTS and (2) its natural history in FDC, contributing to research identifying vulnerable subgroups and malleable factors for PTS and understanding its natural history. No meta-analysis was conducted due to heterogeneity; results were analyzed through narrative synthesis. Results: Eleven longitudinal studies were identified. All but one were prospective cohort designs. They identified prevalence rates between 20% and 48.7% at baseline, 10% and 48.3% at 1 year (k = 7), 18% and 48% at 2–3 years (k = 2), 8% and 38% at 6 years (k = 2), and 35% at 12 years using nine measurement methods in seven independent samples. Evidence from multiple associations supported the following risk factors: exposure to traumatic stressors or other stress, older age, and prior psychopathology. Evidence predominantly supported the stability of PTS with some decline. Conclusion: While results should be interpreted with caution given small or unrepresentative samples, they suggest regular mental health screenings should be conducted for FDC, who are a vulnerable subgroup with variable onset and remission. Risk associations with prior psychopathology also suggest that screening upon arrival may be advisable for early intervention and prevention.

Abstract = {Background: Research suggests that 'mental illness etiological beliefs' and attitudes toward mentally ill people are significantly related; it has also been demonstrated that adult attachment style and empathic self-efficacy affect such attitudes. Moreover, community or regional culture has a significant impact on etiology beliefs and attitudes toward the mentally sick. Materials and methods: We carried out this study in Italy and Israel among psychology students to compare two cultures in regards to causal beliefs of mental disorders and the roles that specific variables, such as secure attachment, empathic self-efficacy, and stress, play in etiological beliefs. The participants (N = 305) were students who belonged to two universities: Padua (N = 183) and Haifa (N = 122). The Many Facet Rasch Model (MFRM) was applied in a cross-cultural perspective to analyze the differential functioning of specific etiological beliefs in relation to the above mentioned variables; the effect of gender and religious beliefs was also entered in the MFRM. Results: The two cultures reacted differently to the biogenetic and psychosocial causal explanations of mental disorders: Israeli students endorsed the biogenetic causal beliefs model more frequently than the Italians. Among other findings, concerning the biogenetic model, the Italian students were predominantly males, who declared to be religious and reported lower levels of secure attachment than Israelis. On the other hand, the Israeli students who manifested a preference toward the biogenetic explanation were mostly females, who declared not to be religious and who manifested higher levels of secure attachment than the Italians. Conclusion: This article is expected to contribute to the improvement of the understanding of general public’s etiological beliefs of mental illness. Similarities and differences between the two cultures, Israel and Italy, have been highlighted on the basis of the MFRM analysis. The effect that interpersonal relations, such as attachment style, perceived empathy, and stress, have on etiological beliefs was also investigated.

Abstract = {Objective Therapists' and patients' concepts of illness often show severe discrepancies. This study explores the illness concepts of patients with schizophrenic disorders (n = 40). Methods Two German scales were used, the "Causal Belief Questionnaire" and the "Illness Concept Scale for Schizophrenic Patients". We compared our data with data published previously. A semi structured interview was performed in a convenience sample (n = 7). Results The domains "trust in medication" and "trust in the treating physician" yielded high scores, yet in comparison with data published 30 years ago, trust in medication is unaltered, while trust in psychiatrists is even slightly lower. Recent psychosocial factors scored high as a possible cause of mental illness. Several patients felt responsible for being mentally ill. No patient in the interview mentioned the neurotransmitter hypothesis of schizophrenia. Conclusion Illness concepts of patients with schizophrenic disorders are a complex phenomenon.

Abstract = {Objective: Therapists’ and patients’ concepts of illness often show severe discrepancies. This study explores the illness concepts of patients with schizophrenic disorders (n = 40). Methods: Two German scales were used, the 'Causal Belief Questionnaire' and the 'Illness Concept Scale for Schizophrenic Patients'. We compared our data with data published previously. A semi structured interview was performed in a convenience sample (n = 7). Results: The domains 'trust in medication' and 'trust in the treating physician' yielded high scores, yet in comparison with data published 30 years ago, trust in medication is unaltered, while trust in psychiatrists is even slightly lower. Recent psychosocial factors scored high as a possible cause of mental illness. Several patients felt responsible for being mentally ill. No patient in the interview mentioned the neurotransmitter hypothesis of schizophrenia. Conclusion: Illness concepts of patients with schizophrenic disorders are a complex phenome)},

Abstract = {Adequate emotional control is essential for mental health. Deficiencies in emotion regulation are evident in many psychiatric disorders, including depression. Patients with depression show, for instance, disrupted neural emotion regulation in cognitive regulation regions such as lateral and medial prefrontal cortices. Since depressed individuals tend to attribute positive events to external circumstances and negative events to themselves, modifying this non-self-serving attributional style may represent a promising regulation strategy. Spontaneous causal attributions are generally processed in medial brain structures, particularly the precuneus. However, so far no study has investigated neural correlates of instructed causal attributions (e.g. instructing a person to intentionally relate positive events to the self) and their potential to regulate emotions. The current study therefore aimed to examine how instructed causal attributions of positive and negative events affect the emotional experience of depressed individuals as well as its neural bases. For this purpose pictures of sad and happy faces were presented to 26 patients with a lifetime major depression (MDD) and 26 healthy controls (HC) during fMRI. Participants should respond naturally ("view") or imagine that the person on the picture was sad/happy because of them ("internal attribution") or because something else happened ("external attribution"). Trait attributional style and depressive symptoms were assessed with questionnaires to examine potential influential factors on emotion regulation ability. Results revealed that patients compared to controls show a non-self-serving trait attributional style (i.e. more external attributions of positive events and more internal attributions of negative events). Intriguingly, when instructed to apply specific causal attributions during the emotion regulation task, patients and controls were similarly able to regulate positive and negative emotions. Regulating emotions through instructed attributions (internal/external attribution>view) generally engaged the precuneus, which was correlated with patients' trait attributional style (i.e. more precuneus activation during external>view was linked to a general tendency to relate positive events to external sources). Up-regulating happiness through internal (compared to external) attributions recruited the parahippocampal gyrus only in controls. The down-regulation of sadness (external>internal attribution), in contrast, engaged the superior frontal gyrus only in patients. Superior frontal gyrus activation thereby correlated with depression severity, which implies a greater need of cognitive resources for a successful regulation in more severely depressed. Patients and controls did not differ in activation in brain regions related to cognitive emotion regulation or attribution. However, results point to a disturbed processing of positive emotions in depression. Interestingly, increased precuneus resting-state connectivity with emotion regulation brain regions (inferior parietal lobule, middle frontal gyrus) was linked to healthier attributions (i.e. external attributions of negative events) in patients and controls. Adequate neural communication between these regions therefore seem to facilitate an adaptive trait attributional style. Findings of this study emphasize that despite patients' dysfunctional trait attributional style, explicitly applying causal attributions effectively regulates emotions. Future research should examine the efficacy of instructed attributions in reducing negative affect and anhedonia in depressed patients, for instance by means of attribution trainings during psychotherapy.

Abstract = {This study aims to examine the association between cancer causal attributions, fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) and psychological well-being and the possible moderating effect of optimism among women with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer. Participants (N = 314) completed an online self-report assessment of causal attributions for their own breast cancer, FCR, psychological well-being and optimism. Simultaneous multiple regression analyses were conducted to explore the overall contribution of causal attributions to FCR and psychological well-being separately. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were also utilised to examine the potential moderating influence of dispositional optimism on the relationship between causal attributions and FCR and psychological well-being. Causal attributions of environmental exposures, family history and stress were significantly associated with higher FCR. The attribution of stress was also significantly associated with lower psychological well-being. Optimism did not moderate the relationship between causal attributions and FCR or well-being. The observed relationships between causal attributions for breast cancer and FCR and psychological well-being suggest that the inclusion of causal attributions in screening for FCR is potentially important. Health professionals may need to provide greater psychological support to women who attribute their cancer to non-modifiable causes and consequently continue to experience distress.

Abstract = {Besides health and social costs, mentally ill, often, are also victims of stigma and discrimination, among many communities in Africa. Cultural beliefs, stereotypes are some of the social constructions used to perpetuate mental illness stigma. The purpose of this study was to describe the nature of stigma communication associated with mental illness, beliefs and stereotypes underpinning mental illness stigma. Generally, the findings indicate nature of mental illness stigma communication is an intersection of stigma messages, cultural beliefs, and stereotypes associated with mental illness. Cultural beliefs associated with mental illness are inextricably intertwined with the perceived causes of mental illness (which include curses, witchcraft, cultural misdemeanor, and possession by spirits or demons). Symptoms of mental illness (mainly aggression and nudity) mark the mentally ill as different and expose them to labeling by the rest of the community. Generally, the mentally ill are stereotyped as aggressive, symbol of shame, and unpredictable. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study sought to explore parent-mediated pathways to mental health, behavioral, and academic service use by investigating the effect of parental causal attributions and perceptions of three forms of stigmatization on treatment preferences. Using a vignette method comparing externalizing behaviors, internalizing symptoms, and learning disability, attributions and stigmatization were found to differ based on presenting problem. Child public stigma and stigma regarding help-seeking both negatively predicted selection of professional treatment options, while parents' courtesy stigma positively predicted treatment agreement. Child stigma also moderated the relationship between internal attributions and professional treatment. Present findings have implications on improving access to care and encouraging service utilization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Although scientific research on the etiology of mental disorders has improved the knowledge of biogenetic and psychosocial aspects related to the onset of mental illness, stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors are still very prevalent and pose a significant social problem. Aim: The aim of this study was to deepen the knowledge of how attitudes toward people with mental illness are affected by specific personal beliefs and characteristics, such as culture and religion of the perceiver. More precisely, the main purpose is the definition of a structure of variables, namely perceived dangerousness, social closeness, and avoidance of the ill person, together with the beliefs about the best treatment to be undertaken and the sick person’ gender, capable of describing the complexity of the stigma construct in particular as far as schizophrenia is concerned. Method: The study involved 305 university students, 183 from the University of Padua, Italy, and 122 from the University of Haifa, Israel. For the analyses, a latent class analysis (LCA) approach was chosen to identify a latent categorical structure accounting for the covariance between the observed variables. Such a latent structure was expected to be moderated by cultural background (Italy versus Israel) and religious beliefs, whereas causal beliefs, recommended treatment, dangerousness, social closeness, and public avoidance were the manifest variables, namely the observed indicators of the latent variable. Results: Two sets of results were obtained. First, the relevance of the manifest variables as indicators of the hypothesized latent variable was highlighted. Second, a two-latent-class categorical dimension represented by prejudicial attitudes, causal beliefs, and treatments concerning schizophrenia was found. Specifically, the differential effects of the two cultures and the religious beliefs on the latent structure and their relations highlighted the relevance of the observed variables as indicators of the expected latent variable. Conclusion: The present study contributes to the improvement of the understanding of how attitudes toward people with mental illness are affected by specific personal beliefs and characteristics of the perceiver. The definition of a structure of variables capable of describing the complexity of the stigma construct in particular as far as schizophrenia is concerned was achieved from a cross-cultural perspective.

Abstract = {Background: As part of a larger epidemiological study of depression among rural Chinese women, we sought to understand their explanatory models of depression. We explored how participants describe depression, to what cause they attribute depression, and what sources of treatment they would recommend. Methods: Participants first were assessed with the Center for Epidemiological-Depression scale (CES-D), with a cut-point of 16 or greater indicative of depression. The Short Explanatory Model Interview (SEMI), a semistructured questionnaire, was our primary tool for exploring participants’ explanatory models relating to a vignette describing a rural Chinese woman with depression. Results: Among the 416 women who consented and completed the SEMI, 277(66.6%) reported that the woman in the vignette had something wrong with her health. Among these, only 8(2.9%) women provided a specific psychiatric name for the condition, while 150(54.2%) provided non-specific psychiatric disease names or affective symptoms, and 78(28.2%)of the sample provided physical disease names. Participants attributed causes largely to internal factors (41.5%) or external factors (36.8%). In terms of help-seeking, 101(36.4%) said the woman in the vignette should see a doctor, 70(25.3%) indicated that she should solve the problem herself, and 42(15.2%) recommended seeking support from family members and friends. We did not find any differences in recognition, causal attribution, and help-seeking suggestions between women with a CES-D ≥ 16 and those with CES-D < 16. Limitations: The use of a vignette to prompt discussion was not the same as talking about real-life personal situations. Conclusion: Our results point to potential challenges and opportunities that lay ahead as China develops mental health services in its vast rural areas among women who may be at risk for developing depression. We found that our participants often attributed their symptoms to internal or external social causes, and preferred not speaking with family members and friends. Our findings suggest that rural Chinese women may be reticent to recognize or describe categorical concepts such as 'depression' as a health problem, and they invite further consideration about how best to develop new health services in China's rural regions.

Abstract = {To assess the effectiveness of China's recent moves to increase community mental health literacy and decrease stigma, we developed the Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire (MHKQ) and the Mental Health Attitude Questionnaire (MHAQ). Preliminary versions were assessed in pilot studies and revised versions were included in an interviewer-administered community survey of a representative sample of 2425 adult residents of Ningxia Province and a re-test survey in 188 individuals. Internal consistency, factor structure and test-retest reliability were assessed for three measures: (a) the 25-item MHKQ (alpha = .71, 6 factors accounting for 51% of variance identified in exploratory factor analysis of one-half of the sample, and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] for total score of .40); (b) the 14-item attitudinal subscale of MHAQ (alpha = .69, 3 factors accounting for 42% of variance, ICC = .47); and (c) the 7-item causal attribution subscale of MHAQ (alpha = .60, 3 factors accounting for 60% of variance, ICC = .26). Confirmatory factor analysis assessed fitness of modified models of the measures using chi-squared, comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA): (a) for the MHKQ, RMSEA = .037 (90% CFI = .033, .040), CFI = .86, TLI = .84, χ² = 682.86 (df = 260); (b) for the attitudinal subscale of MHAQ, RMSEA = .045 (CI = .039, .052), CFI = .94, TLI = .92, χ² = 226.67 (df = 66); and (c) for the causal attribution subscale of MHAQ, RMSEA = .054 (.039, .069), CFI = .97, TLI = .94, χ² = 49.13 (df = 11). We conclude that the internal consistency and factor structure of the new measures are satisfactory, but further work is needed to improve the scales' stability and to assess the construct validity and responsiveness of the scales.

Abstract = {Little is known about the beliefs people with panic disorder (PD) have about their illness and how these beliefs might influence treatment outcome. This study explored demographic and clinical predictors of etiological beliefs about PD and the impact these beliefs have on treatment response. The sample included 251 outpatients with PD who participated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of treatments for PD. Regression analyses revealed that sex, duration of PD and family history of psychiatric illnesses predicted biological etiological beliefs, previous history of psychotherapy predicted environmental etiological beliefs, and age, impaired functioning, and measures of 'fear of fear' predicted multiple etiological beliefs about PD. Etiological beliefs predicted more severe symptoms at 12 weeks post-treatment, irrespective of the type of treatment received, but had no effect on attrition, treatment adherence or treatment-related adverse effects This study contributes to the sparse literature on etiological beliefs about PD. Results are preliminary and further research is needed to understand more fully the factors that shape etiological beliefs about PD, whether these beliefs change over the course of illness, and the impact etiological beliefs have on treatment outcome.

Abstract = {Background: Traditional healing methods are considered central to mental health care in low-income countries such as Ghana, because they are perceived to be more easily accessible, more affordable and generally ascribe similar causal beliefs to those of the patients. However, not much is known about the work of traditional healers largely because their methods are shrouded in mysticism and secrecy. There is a need to understand the ideology and beliefs of traditional healers surrounding mental disorders, including knowledge about their practices in mental health care. Aims: In this article, we discuss the causal beliefs and treatment methods of traditional medicine-men from Accra, Ghana. We also describe their diagnostic and treatment methods for mental disorders. Methods: Eight medicine-men, indigenous to the Greater Accra Region, were interviewed through individual semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed through thematic analysis. Results: The medicine-men’s beliefs about mental illness were dominated by supernatural ideas. Mental illness was also seen as a form of punishment or resulting from envy, and there was a strong reliance on spiritual direction from the gods for diagnosis and treatment. Conclusion: These themes are discussed with emphasis on their potential implications for patients, as well as for collaborative efforts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Introduction: The suicide rate in Guyana was five times higher than the world average in 2014 (WHO) which puts Guyana at the top of the list with 44.2 per 100,000 people, the highest suicide rate in the world. For every completed suicide, there are survivors who experience high levels of psychological, physical, and social distress, and report feelings of guilt, shame, social stigma, and search for meaning. Aim: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore how family members coped and understand the suicide of their loved one, and to determine what resources were available to help them during this transition. Method: Ten family members were recruited to participate in a focus group. The focus group lasted approximately 90 min and was recorded. The audio recordings were later transcribed. Results: Four overarching themes emerged from the data: (1) perceived causes of suicide, (2) perceived solutions, (3) barriers to helping persons who are suicidal, and (4) personal and community reactions to suicide. Implications for practice: Nurses in Guyana are uniquely positioned to take a leadership role in creating and implementing postvention programs for suicide survivors that are culturally and ethnically relevant. Opportunities to partner with schools of nursing in higher income countries are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Viewing mental illness as an ‘illness like any other’ and promoting biogenetic causes have been explored as a stigma‐reduction strategy. The relationship between causal beliefs and mental illness stigma has been researched extensively in the general public, but has gained less attention in more clinically‐relevant populations (i.e. people with mental illness and mental health professionals). A systematic review examining whether endorsing biogenetic causes decreases mental illness stigma in people with mental illness and mental health professionals was undertaken using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses guidelines. Multiple databases were searched, and studies that explored the relationship between biogenetic causal beliefs and mental illness stigma in people with mental illness or mental health professionals were considered. Studies were included if they focussed on depression, schizophrenia, or mental illness in general, were in English, and had adult participants. The search identified 11 journal articles reporting on 15 studies, which were included in this review. Of these, only two provided evidence that endorsing biogenetic causes was associated with less mental illness stigma in people with mental illness or mental health professionals. The majority of studies in the present review (n = 10) found that biogenetic causal beliefs were associated with increased stigma or negative attitudes towards mental illness. The present review highlights the lack of research exploring the impacts of endorsing biogenetic causes in people with mental illness and mental health professionals. Clinical implications associated with these results are discussed, and suggestions are made for further research that examines the relationship between causal beliefs and treatment variables.

Abstract = {Background: Mental illness affects every segment of population including young adults. The beliefs held by young patients regarding the causes of mental illness impact their treatment-seeking behaviour. It is pertinent to know the commonly held attributions around mental illness so as to effectively provide psychological care, especially in a resource constrained context such as Kenya. This helps in targeting services around issues such as stigma and extending youth-friendly services. Methods: Guided by the private theories interview (PTI-P) and attributional framework, individual semi-structured interviews were carried out with ten young adults of ages 18–25 years about their mental health condition for which they were undergoing treatment. Each interview took 30–45 min. We mapped four attributions (locus of control, stability, controllability and stigma) on PTI-P questions. Data was transcribed verbatim to produce transcripts coded using interpretive phenomenological analysis. These codes were then broken down into categories that could be used to understand various attributions. Results: We found PTI-P to be a useful tool and it elicited three key themes: (a) psychosocial triggers of distress (with themes of negative thoughts, emotions around mental health stigma and negative childhood experiences, parents’ separation or divorce, death of a loved one etc.), (b) biological conditions and psychopathologies limiting intervention, and (c) preferences and views on treatment. Mapping these themes on our attributional framework, PTI-P themes presented as causal attributions explaining stigma, locus of control dimensions and stability. External factors were mainly ascribed to be the cause of unstable and uncontrollable attributions including persistent negative emotions and thoughts further exacerbating psychological distress. Nine out of the ten participants expressed the need for more intense and supportive therapy. Conclusion: Our study has provided some experiential evidence in understanding how stigma, internal vs external locus of control, stability vs instability attributions play a role in shaping attitudes young people have towards their mental health. Our study points to psychosocial challenges such as stigma, poverty and lack of social support that continue to undermine mental well-being of Kenyan youth. These factors need to be considered when addressing mental health needs of young people in Kenya. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In recent years, with scientific advances and growing understanding of neurobiological processes, biomedical explanations of psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), have become more prominent in research and in clinical care. Patient perceptions of biomedical models of OCD have been understudied, particularly in how they relate to patients’ beliefs about prognosis and treatment expectancy. The current study measured self-identified OCD patients’ (N = 130) current beliefs about their own prognosis and treatment and how believable they found two explanatory models of OCD: 1) a biomedical model that attributes OCD to biological functioning in the brain and 2) an integrative biopsychopsychocial model. Correlational results indicated that patients who found the biomedical model to be highly believable expected that their OCD would be chronic and require long-term treatment. In contrast, ratings of believability in the model that integrated biological, psychological and social factors in explaining OCD were not associated with prognostic pessimism. Instead, we observed a trend in which stronger belief in the biopsychosocial model was associated with the belief that behavioral changes could improve symptoms of OCD. Notwithstanding limitations inherent in the correlational nature of this study, the current findings highlight the need to further investigate the clinical implications of OCD causal models (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: How we conceptualize mental health conditions is important as it impacts on a wide range of mediators of treatment outcome. We do not know how children intuitively conceptualize obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), nor do we know the relative impact of biomedical or cognitive behavioural conceptual explanations, yet both are being widely used in psychoeducation for children with OCD. Aims: This study identified children's naive concepts of OCD, and the comparative impact of biomedical versus cognitive behavioural psychoeducation on perceived prognosis. Method: A within- and between-subjects experimental design was used. After watching a video of a young person describing their OCD, 202 children completed a questionnaire examining their concepts of the condition. They repeated the questionnaire following a second equivalent video, this time preceded by either biomedical or cognitive behavioural psychoeducation. Results: Participants’ naive concepts of OCD reflected predominant models of OCD in healthcare. Even at the minimal dose of psychoeducation, participants’ conceptualizations of OCD changed. Prior exposure to OCD resulted in a stronger alignment with the biomedical model. Exposure to biomedical psychoeducation resulted in participants predicting a slower recovery with less chance of complete remission. Conclusion: Psychoeducation for childhood OCD is impactful. Despite its wide use by clinicians and mental health services, biomedical psychoeducation appears to have deleterious effects. Children's concepts of OCD merit attention but caution should be applied in how they are targeted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The Kalasha are a religious, ethnic, and linguistic minority community in Pakistan. They are indigenous people living in remote valleys of the Hindu Kush Mountains in northern Pakistan, neighboring Afghanistan. The Kalasha are pastoral, as well as agricultural people to some extent, although they are increasingly facing pressures from globalization and social change, which may be influencing youth and community development. Their traditional world view dichotomizes and emphasizes on the division of the pure ( Onjeshta ) and the impure ( Pragata ). There remains a scarcity of literature on mental health and resilience of indigenous communities in South Asia and Pakistan generally, and the polytheistic Kalasha community specifically. Thus, the current study was conducted with the aim to explore the cultural protective factors (resilience) of the Kalasha youth (adolescents and emerging adults) and to explore their perceived etiological understandings and preferred interventions for mental health support systems. The theoretical framework of Bronfenbrenner's (1, 2) ecological systems model was used. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was conducted, considering the advantage of its idiographic approach and the "double hermeneutic" analytic process. This methodology was consistent with the aim to understand and make sense of mental health and resilience from the Kalasha indigenous perspective. A total of 12 in-depth interviews were conducted with adolescents and emerging adults (5 males, 7 females), along with ethnographic observations. The analysis revealed 3 superordinate themes of mental health perceptions and interventions, each with more specific emergent themes: (1) Psychological Resilience/Cultural Protective Factors Buffering Against Mental Health Problems ( Intra-Communal Bonding & Sharing; Kalasha Festivals & Traditions; Purity Concept; Behavioral Practice of Happiness and Cognitive Patterns ); (2) Perceived Causes of Mental Health Issues ( Biological & Psychosocial; Supernatural & Spiritual ; Environmental ); and (3) Preferred Interventions [ Shamanic Treatment; Ta'awiz (Amulets); Communal Sharing & Problem Solving; Medical Treatment; Herbal Methods ]. The overall findings point to the need for developing culturally-sensitive and indigenous measures and therapeutic interventions. The findings highlighted the Kalasha cultural practices which may promote resilience. The findings also call for indigenous sources of knowledge to be considered when collaboratively designing public health programs.},

Abstract = {Background: Due to an increase in migration and globalization, cross-cultural encounters in health care are also becoming more frequent. As psychotherapy is grounded in a cultural context and must be congruent with the patient’s cultural beliefs of his or her illness in order to be effective, the consideration of cross-cultural differences in illness representations becomes increasingly important. Especially research on illness representations concerning mental disorders is scarce. Methods: The aim of the current study was to compare illness representations between Iranian (N = 87) and German (N = 90) patient samples as well as subclinical samples (Iranian N = 264, German N = 102) using a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Illness representations were measured using the Illness Perception Questionnaire Revised (IPQ-R). Initially, a factor analysis was conducted in order to ensure comparability of the IPQ-R between the Iranian and the German sample. Results: The factor analysis already revealed differences in item compositions of the IPQ-R subscales indicating differences of the conception of illness representations between the samples. Further, the Iranian samples showed a significantly higher amount of supernatural causal beliefs and emotional representation of the illness than the German samples. Surprisingly, the Iranian patient sample showed the highest amount of illness coherence. Conclusion: The current paper contributes to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural differences in illness representations regarding mental disorders. Nevertheless, further research is needed to confirm current findings and to further elaborate on the relationships found. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The article presents a study on the Grey Matter or Social Matters? Causal Attributions in the Era of Biological Psychiatry. An online survey was programmed and hosted on the LimeSurvey Software Version 2.0+ (Germany). The link to the survey was sent to members of European academic communities representing different fields for further distribution. After providing informed consent, participants read a brief text describing the clinical picture of xenomelia. This text was accompanied by a scattergram depicting the correlation mentioned above alongside the display of an inflated right hemisphere showing the location of the cortical area involved. Participants were asked to rate, on the basis of the described finding, the plausibility of each of two statements by placing a slider on a line between 0 (maximally implausible) and 100 (maximally plausible). In total, 769 participants from a European country, who were at least 18 years old, answered the survey. Together, the findings confirm that, in making causal inferences about brain-behavior correlations, 'the vector of causality is unidirectional: from brain to mind', even in academia. The inference of causality regarding the symptoms in conditions such as xenomelia has wide-ranging societal implications. Access to and nature of care will heavily depend on the emerging definitions of such conditions. Fortunately, those whose training prepares them to work in the medical or neuroscientific sector seem slightly less inclined to put grey matter before social matters. There is thus hope that the social and cultural components of xenomelia as well as other conditions in a similar situation will not be underestimated.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by P. Brugger et al. (see record [rid]2013-20861-001[/rid]). The paper by Brugger, Kurthen, Rashidi-Ranjbar and Leggenhager describes how individuals who are 'potential medical specialists' compare to those who are not in perceiving causal attributions in a rare condition, xenomelia. This work is timely given that since the first description in 1977, authors witnessed a raise in studies in 2009 and in 2014, but the general trend is of 3.8 papers per year. Compared to other rare conditions, such as Capgras syndrome or Alien Hand syndrome, the difference is striking. Between 1977 and 2018, 549 papers have been published on Capgras and 176 on Alien Hand. Hence, this paper is fundamental to understand this different attitude towards xenomelia, and what can be done to get out of the quicksand in which authors have ended up. Bruggeret al. paper should guide the development of future studies on xenomelia. We need to include biological, social and cultural components, but for the latter ones we need an operational definition of which components and why. This definition is still lacking, while neuroscientific studies benefit from a clear direction towards exploring more known body representation components. Secondly, we need to know more about the individuals with xenomelia perspective on this causality relationship, as 'patients' are the main actors in clinical settings and without their compliance any effort towards providing support or a treatment is ineffective.

Abstract = {Aims: To identify the common causal beliefs of mental illness in a multi-ethnic Southeast Asian community and describe the sociodemographic associations to said beliefs. The factor structure to the causal beliefs scale is explored. The causal beliefs relating to five different mental illnesses (alcohol abuse, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), dementia and schizophrenia) and desire for social distance are also investigated. Methods: Data from 3006 participants from a nationwide vignette-based study on mental health literacy were analysed using factor analysis and multiple logistic regression to address the aims. Participants answered questions related to sociodemographic information, causal beliefs of mental illness and their desire for social distance towards those with mental illness. Results: Physical causes, psychosocial causes and personality causes were endorsed by the sample. Sociodemographic differences including ethnic, gender and age differences in causal beliefs were found in the sample. Differences in causal beliefs were shown across different mental illness vignettes though psychosocial causes was the most highly attributed cause across vignettes (endorsed by 97.9% of respondents), followed by personality causes (83.5%) and last, physical causes (37%). Physical causes were more likely to be endorsed for OCD, depression and schizophrenia. Psychosocial causes were less often endorsed for OCD. Personality causes were less endorsed for dementia but more associated with depression. Conclusions: The factor structure of the causal beliefs scale is not entirely the same as that found in previous research. Further research on the causal beliefs endorsed by Southeast Asian communities should be conducted to investigate other potential causes such as biogenetic factors and spiritual/supernatural causes. Mental health awareness campaigns should address causes of mental illness as a topic. Lay beliefs in the different causes must be acknowledged and it would be beneficial for the public to be informed of the causes of some of the most common mental illnesses in order to encourage help-seeking and treatment compliance.

Individuals with experience of psychosis were recruited from mental health services for in-depth interviews. A thematic analysis was used to analyse transcripts and key themes were identified. Fifteen interviews were conducted. Individuals were engaged in the process of exploring explanations for their experiences and reported sophisticated models of causation. Participants described a change in their beliefs, with the cause of their experiences not immediately clear. Individuals generated their models via external (family, professionals) and internal (evaluative, positive affect) processes and reported differing levels of conviction in relation to their beliefs. Clinicians should take the opportunity to explore the causal beliefs of their service-users, as they are able to provide intelligent and thoughtful explanatory models. In particular, clinicians should be aware of the emotional impact of different aetiological models and their personal role in the development of a client’s beliefs.

Abstract = {Purpose: Research suggests that the way an individual understands a health difficulty can influence their subsequent behaviour. The aim of this study was to explore the psychometric properties of a new causal belief questionnaire for people who have experience of psychosis. We also planned to provide an overview of current causal beliefs within this group and to explore the relationship between these beliefs and the perceived helpfulness of treatment and the treatment accessed.; Methods: Three hundred and eleven service-users with experience of psychosis completed a questionnaire designed to explore how they understand the cause of their difficulties. Additional information was collected about different aspects of treatment.; Results: The results of the exploratory factor analysis indicated a two-factor solution comprising a psychosocial and biogenetic scale. Individuals in this study endorsed a variety of different causes, with an overall preference for psychosocial explanations. No relationships were established between beliefs and perceptions about the helpfulness of treatment. Individuals who had accessed cognitive behavioural therapy were more likely to endorse the psychosocial factor.; Conclusions: Individuals with psychosis consider a number of factors to be important in relation to the development of their experiences. These beliefs should be explored as part of the therapeutic process as this appears to be important to the individual and could potentially help inform treatment decisions.; Practitioner Points: The causal belief questionnaire captured two underlying constructs relating to psychosocial and biogenetic causes. Individuals within this group endorsed a range of factors; however, they prefer psychosocial causes overall. There was an indication that some aspects of an individual's beliefs were associated with the treatment they accessed. (© 2017 The British Psychological Society.)},

Abstract = {The present study explored perceived causes of, and preferred treatment approach for, mental illness among congregants of six Neo-prophetic churches in Accra and Kumasi through in-depth interviews. Using thematic analysis, five themes emerged from participants’ causal attributions of mental illness. These included lifestyles and environmental stressors, spiritual causes, interaction of multiple factors, trauma and biological causes. Additionally, participants discussed four main mechanisms through which stress leads to mental illness. These included persistent worrying over stressors, use of inappropriate coping strategies to cope with stress, refusal to talk about one's problems and individuals’ appraisal of stress and available coping resources. These beliefs directly determined congregants’ preferred treatment approach. Implications of the findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Guided by transactional stress theory, this research investigated the role of appraisals in noninvolved partners’ mental health and health-compromising behaviors after infidelity. Responses from 232 college students who were recently cheated on revealed that negative appraisals (partner blame, self-blame, and causal attribution) had indirect effects on health-compromising behaviors through mental health (depression, anxiety, and distress). Moderated mediation analyses revealed that gender altered the indirect effect of partner and self-blame on health-compromising behaviors through mental health. Men’s health-compromising behaviors did not differ based on their appraisals or mental health. However, women who reported negative appraisals and high levels of mental health consequences engaged in more health-compromising behaviors. These findings suggest that perceptions of a partner’s infidelity are important, and that those perceptions affect noninvolved partners’ mental health and physical health behaviors.

Abstract = {Introduction: There is a cultural variability around the perception of what causes the syndrome of schizophrenia. As far as the cause of schizophrenia by the general public concerned, people living in western countries focus mainly on biological and social risk factors such as genetic vulnerability, disease of the brain, infection or stressful social conditions or personal weakness, but the predominant views held by people living in non-western countries focus mainly on supernatural and religious factors. Awareness and beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses influence the preferred treatments. The aim of this study was to determine the perceptions regarding the etiology of schizophrenia and the associated factors by theology students. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Holy Trinity Theological College students from May to June 2016. Self-administered Short Explanatory Model Interview was used to assess the perception of what causes the syndrome of schizophrenia. Data entry was performed by Epi-info version 3.5.3 and the Statistical Program for Social Science (SPSS version 20) was used for data clearance, and analyses. Results: A total of 409 students were involved in the survey. The mean age of the participants was 33.3 years (standard deviation ± 8.3) and almost all 94.4% of them were males. The majority (81.7%) of the participant recognized schizophrenia as a mental illness. Only 16.9% of the participants attributed supernatural phenomenon as a cause of schizophrenia and most of them 76.5% (313) thought of psychosocial problems as the cause of schizophrenia. About 40.1% of the participant endorsed biological factors as a cause of schizophrenia. About two-thirds (68.2%) of the participant thought schizophrenia as severe but not fatal illness and about 22.2% of them thought both severe and fatal illness. As far as the course concerned majority (88.5%) of the participants thought schizophrenia as a chronic illness and about 11.5% thought acute illness. Regarding the treatment, almost all (99.8%) of reported schizophrenia is treatable. Moreover, concerning the consequences of the illness about 18.8% reported the death as a consequence and about 66.7, 34.7 and 7.8% reported madness, family disintegration and losing a job, respectively. Urban residency and holding other degree were significantly associated with biological factors as a cause of schizophrenia (p < 0.05). Whereas getting information from mass media and health professional, marital status (married) and urban residence were significantly associated with psychosocial factors as the cause of schizophrenia. Furthermore, rural residency was significantly associated with the supernatural phenomenon as the cause of schizophrenia. Conclusion: In the current study, the majority of the participant recognized schizophrenia as a mental illness and a treatable syndrome. A vast majority of the participant thought of psychosocial problems as the cause of schizophrenia about two-thirds of the participant thought schizophrenia as a severe but not fatal illness. As far as the course concerned majority (88.5%) of the participants thought schizophrenia as a chronic illness. Concerning the consequences of the illness, about 18.8% reported the death as a consequence and about 66.7, 34.7, and 7.8% reported madness, family disintegration and losing a job, respectively. Residency, marital status, and source of information were significantly associated with perceived causes of schizophrenia. Linking mental health service with spiritual care to address community mental health care needs and for early detection as well as referral linkage of mentally ill patients is warranted.

Abstract = {Background: Young adults that are not in education, training or employment represent a problem across European countries. While some are cases of temporary transitions or short-term inactivity, others represent a more vulnerable group at risk of early work disability. Early exclusion from the labor market represents long lives exposed to detrimental effects of unemployment on health and well-being, and constitutes an economic burden for society. There is need for more knowledge about young adults who are at risk of early work disability but have not yet reached the point of more permanent exclusion. This study aims to investigate social and health-related problems in a Norwegian sample of young adults at risk of early work disability, and their self-perceived causes of illness.; Methods: Baseline data from participants in the SEED-trial (N = 96), a randomized controlled trial comparing individual placement and support to traditional vocational rehabilitation in young adults at risk of early work disability, were analyzed. Background, health behaviors, adverse social experiences, disability level, physical and mental health, social support, coping, and self-perceived causal attributions of illness were measured. Gender differences were analyzed using chi-square and t-tests.; Results: Mean age was 24, and 68% were men. One third reported reading and writing difficulties, and 40% had less than high-school education. The majority had experienced bullying (66%) or violence (39%), and 53% reported hazardous alcohol use. Psychological distress was the most prevalent health problem (52%), and women generally had more physical and mental health problems than men. Self-perceived causal attributions of illness were mainly related to relational problems, followed by health behaviors, heredity/genetics, and external environmental factors.; Conclusions: The study provides a deeper insight into a vulnerable group with substantial challenges related to adverse social experiences, psychological distress, and alcohol use, who emphasized relational problems as the main causal factor for their illness. Findings suggest a need for broader focus on psychological and social factors in vocational rehabilitation efforts targeting young adults at risk of early work disability. Furthermore, gender-specific approaches may be warranted and should be followed up in future studies.; Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02375074 .

Abstract = {Suicide-attacks are possibly increasing in frequency all over the world. To date, these attacks are not considered as a manifestation of a particular mental illness. However, the process of radicalization of suicide-attackers has to interest the field of mental health. One plausible explanation for the radicalization of individuals is the use of biased cognitive schemes by the indoctrinator. Among these cognitive schemes could figure the causal attribution bias in which the subject cannot distinguish in front of two factors that operate simultaneously, the share of each factor in achieving a certain goal. Another cognitive bias would be the confirmation bias during which the subject would tend to adhere to ideas from his/her own thinking or the thinking of subjects who share some cultural values with him/her and refute any other ideas. Finally, the bias of polarization or splitting could also be incriminated. Through this bias, the subject would either be proud of being a member of a cultural group or ashamed when he/she feels that this group is being attacked and that he/she is unable to rescue it. Approaches to increase the awareness of individuals to the adverse effects of these biased cognitive schemes may theoretically reduce the risk of committing suicide-attacks. However, despite numerous attempts of "deradicalization" involving technological means of communication as well as social "reintegration" centers, all approaches aiming at raising awareness of cognitive biases need to be studied in a scientific manner before they become widespread.

Abstract = {Objective: This study qualitatively explored adolescents’ causal beliefs about depression. Method: Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with 38 Australian secondary students (25 females, 13 males) aged 15–17 years. Adolescents were asked an open-ended question about the causes of depression, followed by a series of prompts about common causes of illness. A deductive thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes within the data set. Results: Participants emphasised potentially mutable psychosocial causes of depression (e.g., exposure to stressors, lifestyle) over biogenetic factors (e.g., genetics, chemical imbalance). Stigmatising explanations of depression were rare, although a minority gave explanations broadly consistent with a ‘weak not sick’ stigmatising attitude. Conclusion: The findings suggest that adolescents perceived depression causation to be complex and multifactorial. Understanding the causal beliefs that are most salient amongst adolescents can inform messaging in relation to efforts to prevent depression at this time.

Abstract = {Increasing availability of antiretroviral treatment (ART) has led HIV to be considered a chronic disease, shifting attention to focus on quality of life including mental wellbeing. We investigated knowledge and causal attributions for mental disorders in HIV-positive children and adolescents in rural and urban Uganda. This qualitative study was nested in an epidemiological mental health study among HIV-positive children and adolescents aged 5–17 years in rural and urban Uganda. In-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers of HIV-positive children (5–11 years) and adolescents (12–17 years) in HIV care. Interviews were audio recorded with permission from participants and written consent and assent sought before study procedures. Thirty eight participants (19 caregivers, 19 children/adolescents) were interviewed. Age range of caregivers was 28–69 years; majority were female (17). Caregivers had little knowledge on mental disorders ;only 3 related the vignette to a mental problem and attributed it to: improper upbringing, violence, poverty and bereavement. Five adolescents identified vignettes as portraying mental disorders caused by: ill-health of parents, bereavement, child abuse, discrimination, HIV and poverty. Caregivers are not knowledgeable about behavioural and emotional challenges in HIV-positive children/adolescents. Mental health literacy programmes at HIV care clinics are essential to enhance treatment-seeking for mental health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Respondents (n = 507) were presented with depression and schizophrenia symptoms using unlabeled case vignettes. A factor analysis examined three factors for causal beliefs, and multiple linear regression analysis on the desire for social distance was conducted. The desire for social distance was higher when symptoms in both case-vignettes were attributed to childhood adversities and overall lower when respondents lived in northern regions of Ghana. Only, for vignettes depicting schizophrenia, mental illness attribution was associated with more desire for social distance.

Abstract = {The current study systematically explored and described religious/spiritual (r/s) struggles – distress, tension, and conflict about certain aspects of r/s belief, practice, or experience – in a Veteran sample. Participants were 178 United States Veterans (148 men, 30 women) receiving care at a VA hospital and affiliated outpatient clinics who reported a current r/s struggle. Veterans completed a psychiatric interview and self-report measures of demographics, military experience, and levels of religiousness. They completed self-report scales assessing levels of r/s struggle across different domains (i.e. divine, demonic, interpersonal, moral, doubt, ultimate meaning), provided open-ended descriptions of r/s struggles that were coded for these domains, and reported on a variety of characteristics related to their r/s struggle (e.g., duration, course, perceived cause, perceived impact on life, spiritual growth/decline resulting from the r/s struggle). Descriptive results from quantitative and qualitative data showed that Veterans perceived r/s struggles, particularly moral struggles, as salient and impactful. Veterans reported substantial positive effects and small negative effects of r/s struggles on their psychological and r/s functioning. Higher perceived negative effects were related to higher levels of r/s struggle domains. Statistical analyses comparing levels of r/s struggles and r/s struggle attributes across sample characteristics (e.g., demographics, psychiatric diagnosis, military experience) showed that, after controlling for religiousness, older age showed a positive association with positive perceived adaptation to r/s struggles, whereas the presence of a mental disorder and distressing military experiences showed associations with negative perceived adaptation. We discuss potential implications of these findings for research and clinical work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background. Common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs) are frequently experienced in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), where low-educational attainment, poverty, and gender-based violence are widely recognized risk factors. The goal of this dissertation research was to examine local understandings of perinatal mental health to inform the development of a mental health intervention that will be integrated into community-based maternal health services in Selingue, Mali. To achieve this goal, we had three research aims: first, to qualitatively identify local terms and ethnomedical models for mental health among perinatal women in Mali, West Africa; second, to develop a holistic understanding of local syndrome(s) for mental health among perinatal women; and third, to identify a feasible and acceptable intervention model for the integration of mental health into community-based maternal services for perinatal women in Selingue, Mali. Methods. First, we conducted freelist interviews among perinatal women, auxiliary midwives, and community health workers (CHWs), to identify local terms for mental health. In-depth interviews were carried out among perinatal women, auxiliary midwives, CHWs, and mental health specialists to gain a nuanced understanding of priority mental health problems, perceived causes, and if and how women seek care or manage their distress. To gain a holistic understanding of local syndrome(s) for perinatal mental health, we conducted pile sorts, asking participants to sort 36 terms, identified from the free lists, into groups based on which terms go together. We then performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a perinatal depression scale, adapted for the Malian context. Lastly, we performed a scoping literature review on current best practices for closing the maternal mental health treatment gap and used data from in-depth interviews to develop recommendations for a locally informed approach for integrated mental and maternal health care. Results. Perinatal women used idioms of distress to communicate difficulties (geleya), pain, stress, and suffering (tooro), worries (hamin), and a crying heart or sadness (dusukasi). Participants indicated that these idioms of distress operate along a progressive continuum of severity of distress that increases with time, both between and within idioms. Using multidimensional scaling to analyze the pile sorts data, we identified a single large cluster, indicating that there is one single category of included terms for perinatal mental distress. The EFA results were in agreement with the pile sorts findings, yielding one single underlying construct for perinatal mental distress. Results from the scoping literature review indicate that integrated mental health intervention models that rely on task-sharing, are successful and strong approaches to address barriers towards closing the mental health treatment gap. Our qualitative findings suggest that it is both locally feasible and acceptable to integrate mental health services into existing community health care systems. Conclusions. Qualitative and quantitative examination of perinatal mental health in Selingue, Mali, contributed to both the holistic understanding and measurement of perinatal depression. In the context of poverty and lack of care and treatment options for mental illness, interventions that integrate mental health into community-based maternal health services emerge as locally acceptable and feasible strategies to narrow the mental health treatment gap in Selingue, Mali.

Abstract = {The purpose of this mixed method study was to examine the relationship between a teacher's causal attribution of student behavior and their decision to write a student a discipline referral. This study included a review of data collected from Teachers' Attribution for Students' Behavior Measure (TASBM) from a purposeful sample of teachers from a large suburban school district in southeast Texas. A purposeful sample of teachers were interviewed in an attempt to provide a more in-depth understanding of teacher's perception of student's behaviors and the disciplinary process. Quantitative data were analyzed using simple linear regression, while an inductive coding process was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that there was not a significant mean difference between teacher's gender, race, or years of experience and the number of referrals written.

Abstract = {To date, stigma toward individuals with Mental Illness (MI) is a severe social problem as well as a heavy burden for affected people. Assessing the complex issue of mental illness involves complex evaluation procedures able to define structures of interactive variables, such as etiological beliefs, attitudes, prejudices, personal, and social problems, both toward mentally ill persons and in the mental disorders’ perceiver, while taking into account the role of different cultures. A key role is also played by treatments and their relations with causal beliefs and with other variables. Furthermore, and of fundamental importance in this context is the distinction of different mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and addiction, which should be studied separately to highlight the specificity of their relations with stigma.

Abstract = {Background: Suicide is a major global health concern. Bhutanese refugees resettled in the USA are disproportionately affected by suicide, yet little research has been conducted to identify factors contributing to this vulnerability. This study aims to investigate the issue of suicide of Bhutanese refugee communities via an in-depth qualitative, social-ecological approach. Methods: Focus groups were conducted with 83 Bhutanese refugees (adults and children), to explore the perceived causes, and risk and protective factors for suicide, at individual, family, community, and societal levels. Audio recordings were translated and transcribed, and inductive thematic analysis conducted. Results: Themes identified can be situated across all levels of the social-ecological model. Individual thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are only fully understood when considering past experiences, and stressors at other levels of an individual's social ecology. Shifting dynamics and conflict within the family are pervasive and challenging. Within the community, there is a high prevalence of suicide, yet major barriers to communicating with others about distress and suicidality. At the societal level, difficulties relating to acculturation, citizenship, employment and finances, language, and literacy are influential. Two themes cut across several levels of the ecosystem: loss; and isolation, exclusion, and loneliness. Conclusions: This study extends on existing research and highlights the necessity for future intervention models of suicide to move beyond an individual focus, and consider factors at all levels of refugees’ social-ecology. Simply focusing treatment at the individual level is not sufficient. Researchers and practitioners should strive for community-driven, culturally relevant, socio-ecological approaches for prevention and treatment.

Abstract = {Women of Turkish descent in Germany show higher rates of suicidal behavior compared to their host populations and men of Turkish descent.

Nine focus groups ( N = 61) were conducted to assess explanatory models including patterns of distress, perceived causes, course/consequences of and reactions towards a suicidal crisis, help-seeking behavior, and potential intervention and prevention strategies. All participants were of Turkish descent living in Berlin, Germany. The focus groups included two with professionals such as psychiatrists or psychotherapists, two with Community Mothers, three with women from the community (ages: 18 -34, 35 -49, 50+), and of three suicide attempters (ages: 18 -33, 38 -66). Data were analyzed using the methodology of thematic analysis. Results show that suicide-related behaviors, attitudes, and help-seeking behavior have gender and culture-specific characteristics. Two central themes were identified: the impact of family and community and the impact of German society. Participants stated that they believe that family and community pressures as well as discrimination and lack of acceptance cause social isolation. Fear of stigmatization and dishonoring themselves or their family, as well as shame and self-stigma decrease the likelihood of reaching out for help. Recommended strategies are community and family interventions, promotion of integration and social inclusion, awareness campaigns to destigmatize suicidality and the use of mental health services, empowerment of women, as well as the improvement of cultural sensitivity and competency of services.},

In this study with 301 unemployed persons with mental health problems, we assessed whether disease concepts are associated with secrecy. We found that genetic and neurobiological disease models are significantly associated with more secrecy. This might be due to a cognitive bias called genetic essentialism. Critical awareness of biogenetic disease models and programmes helping with disclosure decisions might be helpful. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Stigma poses an additional burden for people suffering from mental illness, one that often impairs their social participation and can prevent them from seeking adequate help. It is therefore crucial to understand how stigma develops in order to counteract it by setting up effective evidence-based anti-stigma interventions. The present study examines the effect of causal beliefs on stigmatizing behavioral intentions, namely people's desire to distance themselves from persons with mental illness. In addition, we draw cross-cultural comparisons between native Germans and Turkish immigrants to investigate the influence of culture on stigma and causal beliefs and to broaden knowledge on the biggest immigrant group in Germany and on immigrants in Western countries in general. Methods: n = 302 native Germans and n = 173 Turkish immigrants were presented either a depression or a schizophrenia vignette. Then, causal beliefs, emotional reaction and desire for social distance were assessed with questionnaires. Path analyses were carried out to investigate the influence of causal beliefs on the desire for social distance and their mediation by emotional reactions for Germans and Turkish immigrants, respectively. Results: We found an influence of causal beliefs on the desire for social distance. Emotional reactions partly mediated this relationship. Causal attribution patterns as well as the relationship between causal attributions and stigma varied across both subsamples and mental illnesses. In the German subsample, the ascription of unfavorable personal traits resulted in more stigma. In the Turkish immigrant subsample, supernatural causal beliefs increased stigma while attribution to current stress reduced stigma. Conclusion: Our study has implications for future anti-stigma interventions that intend to reduce stigmatization of mentally ill people. Targeting the ascription of unfavorable personal traits and supernatural causal attributions as well as promoting current stress as the cause for mental illness appears to be of particular importance. Also, the mediating influence of emotional responses to causal beliefs needs to be addressed. Furthermore, differential interventions across cultural groups and specific mental illnesses may be appropriate. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Introduction: Hispanics/Latinos utilize mental health care at a rate that is about half that of non-Hispanic Whites. Stigma and cultural and religious values play a significant role in mental health care utilization disparities. The purpose of this study was to explore beliefs about mental illness among Latino faith-based communities. Methods: A qualitative approach was used to explore perceptions of mental illness that were elicited during 'El Buen Consejo,' a mental health literacy intervention delivered within three faith-based settings. Results: Participants were socialized to believe that persons with mental illness were dangerous, out of control, and suffering from an incurable illness that resulted in rejection and ostracism. Most families would deny the existence of depression and mental illness, unless symptoms greatly interfered with daily functioning or were life-threatening. Religious coping such as prayer, and faith in God, were believed to be protective factors. Causal attributions for depression were both biomedical and religious, such as lack of faith, not praying, demons, and sinful behaviors of parents. Conclusion: Latinos rely upon churches as a major social, educational, and spiritual resource. The cultural values among Latinos can be a source of strength but also contribute to stigma. The faith-based community is an important target for mental health literacy and antistigma interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Introduction: Research on parental understanding of causation and help-seeking for ADHD comes from ethnic minorities in developed nations; research from Asia is scarce. Our purpose was to explore perceptions of Indian parents regarding causation and diagnosis of problematic childhood behaviors diagnosed as ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder, and to understand the process of decision making and help seeking using a qualitative study design. Method: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 52 parents (33 mothers and 19 fathers), focusing on initial emotional reactions and cognitive appraisals, decision making, parental causal explanations and perceptions regarding diagnosis and symptom labeling. Results: Mothers were decision makers for seeking professional help either singly or jointly in 76.1% of cases. Initial reactions ranged from those with negative valence (negative emotional reactions and cognitive appraisals) to ambi-valence (recognition of problems, but at the same time not accepting completely) and positive valence (sense of relief and hopefulness). Psycho-social explanations (63.46%) were more common than biological explanations (51.82%), with 19.23% reporting both explanations. Biological explanations included illness model (e.g. brain problem, obstetric complications), hereditary and intellectual disability. Psycho-social explanations included psychological (e.g. lack of motivation) and social (e.g. problems with disciplining at home) causations. Irrespective of initial reactions and causal explanations, a significant majority of parents were aware of the diagnosis and labeled problems as symptoms attributable to ADHD. Conclusion: Our findings provide insights for development of culturally sensitive psycho-social interventions; from understanding of causal attributions, process of decision making and help seeking.

Abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness affecting the social and occupational lives of the sufferers and posing a considerable burden on the patients and their families. Furthermore, negative societal reactions and the internalization of these attitudes exacerbate the difficulties encountered. This study examines the perspectives of Turkish people with schizophrenia on how they view the impact of the illness on their lives, the societal reactions and attitudes to schizophrenia and whether they agree with these reactions. Methods: Twenty-three adult participants, all members of two schizophrenia associations in Ankara, capital of Turkey, were recruited. Semistructured interviews were used to find out their perspectives on how the illness affected their lives, how the society reacts to them and their views on these reactions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematic analysis was used to capture the general and the subthemes. Results: The findings suggest that causal attributions for the illness, the impact of illness on various life domains, challenges of living with the illness and finally stigmatization are general categories that capture the perspectives of the participants. Conclusion: People diagnosed with schizophrenia experience the impacts and burdens of their illness in various domains of their lives and negative societal reactions heighten these burdens. It seems important to consider the challenges faced by people with schizophrenia in living with their illness and the impacts of negative societal behaviors and attitudes in offering psychosocial interventions programs for supporting this group. Furthermore, combating negative societal attitudes also seems to be necessary. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Beliefs about and attitudes toward mental illness may be influenced by cultural- or country-specific contexts. Through a national survey, the current study investigated beliefs and attitudes toward people with schizophrenia and depression among the general public in Taiwan. A random-digit-dialing telephone-based cross-sectional survey was administered to Taiwanese adults aged 20–64 years (n = 1600). The data were analyzed through binary logistic regressions to test for differences between these disorders in causal beliefs, stereotypes, emotional reactions, desire for social distance, and help-seeking behavior. The results revealed that respondents were more concerned with biogenetic causal explanations for people with schizophrenia than for those with depression. Significantly more respondents perceived people with schizophrenia as more likely to be unpredictable and violent toward others. A similar trend was observed for the desire for social distance. For both disorders, respondents were significantly more likely to express compassion than to express anger toward the person described in the vignette. Respondents also expressed more desire for social distance from someone like the vignette who have received psychiatric treatment. These findings provide useful directions for the implementation of optimal psychoeducation among such communities. . (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI) rarely seek mental health treatment for reasons that are minimally understood. To assess the mental illness stigma context in NHPI communities that may be contributing to low help-seeking, this study collected novel stigma data from two large U.S. NHPI communities from October 2017 to January 2018, then compared this data to national stigma data from the U.S. public. Survey data were collected from 222 community-dwelling NHPI participants recruited by research-trained NHPI staff. Surveys incorporated well-established vignettes describing persons with major depression and schizophrenia. Study data were compared to U.S. general public data from the 2006 General Social Survey: the largest U.S. stigma study. Compared to the U.S. public, NHPI participants reported greater stigma toward mental illness in ways likely to impede help-seeking including: (1) more frequently endorsing stigmatizing causal attributions of depression and schizophrenia, (2) less frequently perceiving disorders as serious, and (3) more commonly desiring social distance from persons with depression. Study data are the first to reveal the presence of a strongly stigmatizing context in NHPI communities likely to hinder NHPI help-seeking. Thus, culturally tailoring anti-stigma interventions to appropriately target NHPI mental health attitudes and beliefs may prove effective in promoting NHPI help-seeking.

Abstract = {While previous research has demonstrated the negative impact of stigma in individuals with mental health problems, little is known about cross-cultural differences in experiences and explanations of mental health, in particular in young people, despite the first episode of psychosis often occurring in adolescence. Aim of this study was to examine cultural differences in causal beliefs and stigma toward mental health, in particular psychosis. White British and South Asian young people (N = 128) from two schools and colleges in the United Kingdom, aged 16 to 20 years, completed a cross-sectional survey. Results revealed significant associations between ethnic group and our dependent measures. White British reported more previous contact with a mental health service as well as with people with mental health problems than South Asians. They also reported lower stigma in form of a greater intentions to engage in contact with people with mental health problems. Furthermore, South Asians reported higher beliefs in supernatural causes of psychosis than White British. Psychotic experiences moderated the effect of ethnic group on supernatural beliefs, with South Asians reporting higher supernatural beliefs than White British when their own psychotic experiences were low to moderate. We discuss the implications of the findings, arguing that a greater culture-sensitive understanding of mental health is important to reach ethnic minorities with psychosis, and to challenge stigma toward psychosis from an early age on.

Abstract = {We sought to investigate situation-specific inflated sense of responsibility and explanatory style in social anxiety disorder (SAD) according to the cognitive model. Participants aged 17–68 years (mean = 31.9, SD = 11.1) included waiting list patients referred to a primary care mental health service for cognitive behavioural therapy for SAD (n = 18) and non-anxious control participants (n = 65). A battery of psychometric measures, including a bespoke measure of responsibility beliefs, was used. Compared with controls, participants with SAD were more likely to demonstrate an inflated sense of responsibility (p ≤ 0.001), and to adopt a negative explanatory style specific to social interaction (p ≤ 0.01). Inflated sense of responsibility was found to correlate with SAD symptomatology (r = 0.47, p ≤ 0.05), and with increased usage of safety behaviours (r = 0.47, p ≤ 0.05). Caseness (β = 1.45, p ≤ 0.01) and stability of causal attribution (β = 0.25, p ≤ 0.001) were found to predict inflated responsibility in our sample. To our knowledge this study represents the first attempt to investigate inflated responsibility within the context of SAD. Our results support the notion of inflated responsibility as a feature of SAD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Individuals with psychosis are often subject to external stigma and discrimination and commonly also experience internalized stigma. Attempts to improve attitudes have tended to medicalize the experiences associated with psychosis; however, research increasingly indicates an association between biogenetic attitudes and stigma. This study aims to evaluate this approach by investigating the impact of two different etiological explanations on both internalized and external stigma in people experiencing psychosis. A total of 60 participants who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or meet criteria for early intervention services for psychosis were randomly allocated to one of two conditions (psychosocial vs. biogenetic). Attitudes were assessed before and after the intervention. Both interventions resulted in a decrease in internalized stigma. Only the psychosocial intervention decreased external stigma. Although further research is necessary, providing education to individuals could be an effective way to reduce internal stigma. Antistigma campaigns should avoid a singular focus on biogenetic explanations of psychosis, and a psychosocial viewpoint may be a suitable alternative.

Abstract = {Background: Stigma associated with mental illness (MI) results in underutilization of mental health care. We must understand factors contributing to stigma to shape anti-stigma campaigns.; Aims: To investigate the factors influencing stigma in university students.; Method: Undergraduate psychology students completed measures on causal attribution, stigma, social distance, implicit person theory (IPT), and familiarity.; Results: The hypothesis was partially supported; people who felt personality traits were unchangeable (i.e. entity IPT) were more likely to stigmatize individuals with mental disorders and desired more social distance from them. Familiarity with people with a MI individually predicted less desire for social distance, yet the redundancy of the predictors made the effect of familiarity on stigma fall just short of statistical significance. Judgments of biogenetic causal attribution were related to higher stigma levels, but not so when familiarity and IPT were taken into account.; Conclusions: Educational campaigns may be effective by focusing on aspects of MI highlighting similarity with non-diagnosed people, and that people with MI can recover.},

Abstract = {This descriptive study explored pastors' beliefs about etiology and treatment of mental illness. Surveys were completed by mail by 202 Korean and Euro-American Presbyterian clergy. Nearly one-third of Korean pastors viewed bad parenting and demon possession as very important causes of mental illness, in contrast to the more than two-thirds of Euro-American pastors who viewed genetics and chemical imbalances as the most important causes. Compared with their Euro-American counterparts, Korean pastors soundly endorsed spiritual treatment of mental illness. The findings of this study suggest the value of understanding the views of pastors working with populations that underutilize formal mental health services.},

Abstract = {Background: Causal attributions are central to the understanding of public reactions to disability (that is, disability-related stigma). Research shows that culture and ethnicity were found to play a significant role in both causal attributions of disability and disability-related stigma. Disability-related stigma was found to influence physical and mental health. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the relationships linking culture, causal attributions of disability and disability-related stigma, have not been previously examined. Objective: The study examined whether causal attributions (natural, mystic, punitive and emotional) to a specific disability-visual impairments - mediate the relationship between culture and stigma towards individuals with visual impairments. Methods: A quota sample comprised of 305 university and college students was drawn. Data were collected via a self-reported questionnaire. Results: The main findings indicated that emotional and punitive causal attribution to visual impairments mediated the relationship between culture and visual impairments-stigma; Israeli Arab-Palestinians had a higher tendency to attribute higher levels of punitive and emotional causes to visual impairments compared to Israeli Jews. Higher levels of punitive and emotional attributed causes for visual impairments were correlated with higher levels of visual impairments-stigma. Israeli Arab-Palestinians have a higher tendency to attribute visual impairments to mystic causes compared to Israeli Jews. However, this type of perceived causation was unrelated to visual impairments-stigma. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce visual impairments-stigma should focus on misconceptions concerning causation. It is especially important to design culturally sensitive interventions for visual impairments stigma reduction among Israeli Arab-Palestinians, which will focus on de-psychologizing visual impairments.

Abstract = {Background and objectives: Social support is linked with psychological health, but its mechanisms are unclear. We examined supporters’ influence on recipients’ cognitive processing as a mechanism of effects of support on outcomes associated with depression.Design/methods: 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment. 147 participants (1) experienced a negative event (false feedback); (2) received social support modeling one of two contrasting cognitive processing modes (abstract/evaluative or concrete/experiential); (3) generated explanations for the event, later coded for processing mode and internal/external causal attribution; and (4) reported on emotion, perceptions of self and future, and social affiliation. To examine relational effects, half of participants were led to perceive the supporter as similar to themselves via a shared birthday manipulation.Results: Support condition influenced participants’ processing mode and causal attributions as predicted. Abstract/evaluative support led to more positive emotion and self-perceptions, and less pessimistic expectancies for the future than concrete/experiential support. Perceived similarity moderated effects on beliefs about an upcoming social interaction, magnifying positive affiliation outcomes of abstract/evaluative versus concrete/experiential support. Conclusions: Processing modes that are generally maladaptive at the intrapersonal level may be adaptive (and vice versa) when they are interpersonally influenced, and perceived similarity may facilitate interpersonal effects of processing mode on affiliation.

Abstract = {Background: Over 75% of people with mental neurological and substance use disorders (MNSD) live in low and middle-income countries with limited access to specialized care. The World Health Organization’s Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) aims to address the human resource gap but it requires contextualization. Aims: We conducted a qualitative study in rural coastal Kenya to explore the local terms, perceived causes and management modalities of priority MNSD listed in the mhGAP, to inform implementation in this setting. Methods: We conducted 8 focus group discussions with primary health care providers and traditional health practitioners and used the framework method to conduct thematic analysis. We identified local terms, perceived causes and treatment options for MNSD. We also explored possibilities for collaboration between the traditional health practitioners and primary health care providers. Results: We found local terms for depression, psychoses, epilepsy, disorders due to substance use and self-harm/ suicide but none for dementia. Child and adolescent mental and behavioral problems were not regarded as MNSD but consequences of poor parenting. Self-harm/suicide was recognized in the context of other MNSD. Causes of MNSD were broadly either biological or supernatural. Treatment options were dependent on perceived cause of illness. Most traditional health practitioners were willing to collaborate with primary health care providers mainly through referring cases. Primary health care providers were unwilling to collaborate with traditional health practitioners because they perceived them to contribute to worsening of patients’ prognoses. Conclusions: Local terms and management modalities are available for some priority MNSD in this setting. Community level case detection and referral may be hindered by lack of collaboration between traditional health practitioners and primary health care providers. There is need for training on the recognition and management of all priority MNSD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background : Causal beliefs are thought to influence consumers' perceptions of their mental illness and self-stigma, and may impact treatment and recovery. Understanding consumers' perspective on causes being addressed in treatment is vital to help guide future research and improve services. Aim : This study aimed to explore consumers' views on causes of mental illness being addressed in treatment, along with their subjective experiences of how causes were focused on in their treatment. Methods : Using a qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 consumers who self-identified as having a mental illness. A thematic analytic framework was used to identify and analyse themes that emerged within the data. Results : Consumers believed that causes were important and should be addressed in treatment, and identified several associated benefits including increased insight/personal understanding of their illness, symptom management and relapse prevention and reduced self-blame. Negative consequences and considerations were also identified. Conclusion : Causes help consumers make sense of their illness, and consumers would like causes to be addressed in treatment. More research is needed on how mental health professionals can address causes effectively as consumers are currently dissatisfied with how causes were discussed in their treatment.},

Abstract = {Aims: Many people with mental illness do not seek professional help. Beliefs about the causes of their current health problem seem relevant for initiating treatment. Our aim was to find out to what extent the perceived causes of current untreated mental health problems determine whether a person considers herself/himself as having a mental illness, perceives need for professional help and plans to seek help in the near future. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we examined 207 untreated persons with a depressive syndrome, all fulfilling criteria for a current mental illness as confirmed with a structured diagnostic interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview). The sample was recruited in the community using adverts, flyers and social media. We elicited causal explanations for the present problem, depression literacy, self-identification as having a mental illness, perceived need for professional help, help-seeking intentions, severity of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire—Depression), and whether respondents had previously sought mental healthcare. Results: Most participants fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder (n = 181, 87.4%) and/or neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (n = 120, 58.0%) according to the ICD-10. N = 94 (45.4%) participants had never received mental health treatment previously. Exploratory factor analysis of a list of 25 different causal explanations resulted in five factors: biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma, current stress and unhealthy behaviour. Attributing the present problem to biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma and stress were all associated with stronger self-identification as having a mental illness. In persons who had never received mental health treatment previously, attribution to biomedical causes was related to greater perceived need and stronger help-seeking intentions. In those with treatment experience, lower attribution to person-related causes and stress were related to greater perceived need for professional help. Conclusions: While several causal explanations are associated with self-identification as having a mental illness, only biomedical attributions seem to be related to increase perceived need and help-seeking intentions, especially in individuals with no treatment experiences. Longitudinal studies investigating causal beliefs and help-seeking are needed to find out how causal attributions guide help-seeking behaviour. From this study it seems possible that portraying professional mental health treatment as not being restricted to biomedical problems would contribute to closing the treatment gap for mental disorders.

Abstract = {Parents' attributions about their child's personality and behaviour are known to predict the quality of parent-child interactions and outcomes for the child, including those from parenting interventions. Nothing is known, however, about the quantity and quality of attributions parents use during free speech about their children referred for treatment of behavioural and emotional problems. We tested hypotheses about the types of attributions and associations among parental attributions, parental psychopathology and child conduct problems, using 504 five-minute speech samples (FMSS) coded using the Parent Attribution Speech Sample (PASS) coding system. Both mothers and fathers talked about their thoughts and feelings regarding their children with disruptive behaviour problems (N = 295; 74% male; 3-8 years old). The assessment of spontaneous parental attributions via the PASS coding system was shown to be valid and reliable. Mothers made more negative, dispositional attributions than fathers, however, parents of either gender made, on average, more positive than negative attributions about their children. Parents' natural attributions about these children with emotional and behavioural problems were rather independent from parents' own mental health, but were consistently related to child factors. Specifically, across parent gender and across all attribution dimensions, levels of callous-unemotional traits were associated with spontaneous parental attributions above and beyond other child and parent factors. Overall, the results show that parents' spontaneous speech about referred children contains important information about their causal attributions, and that these are associated with child temperament rather than specific referral symptoms.},

Abstract = {Mental illness is a common comorbidity of HIV and complicates treatment. In Botswana, stigma impedes treatment of mental illness. We examined explanatory beliefs about mental illness, stigma, and interactions between HIV and mental illness among 42 adults, from HIV clinic and community settings, via thematic analysis of interviews. Respondents endorse witchcraft as a predominant causal belief, in addition to drug abuse and effects of HIV. Respondents describe mental illness as occurring 'when the trees blossom,' underscoring a conceptualization of it as seasonal, chronic, and often incurable and as worse than HIV. Consequently, people experiencing mental illness (PEMI) are stereotyped as dangerous, untrustworthy, and cognitively impaired and discriminated against in the workplace, relationships, and sexually, increasing vulnerability to HIV. Clinical services that address local beliefs and unique vulnerabilities of PEMI to HIV, integration with peer support and traditional healers, and rehabilitation may best address the syndemic by facilitating culturally consistent recovery-oriented care.

Abstract = {Rationale: Mind-body therapy use is an increasing social and clinical trend. Practitioners of mind-body therapies still disseminate traditional mechanistic explanations such as purification of mental or vital forces. These explanations sound similar to magical thinking, especially thought-action fusion. Objective: The present research examined whether mind-body therapy users exhibit two related forms of magical thinking, including thought-action fusion. Method: Two online, cross-sectional studies with U.S. participants (Study 1 N = 645; Study 2 N = 566) assessed thought-action fusion and magical causal belief, along with mind-body therapy use and potential covariates. Results: The results from Study 1 revealed that thought-action fusion was uniquely associated with mind-body therapy use. This finding was replicated in Study 2, in which thought-action fusion was uniquely associated with past-year mind-body therapy use for psychological reasons and for pain/nausea. Additionally in Study 2, magical causal belief was uniquely associated with past-year use for pain/nausea and for physical disease. Conclusions: Magical thinking, particularly thought-action fusion, may be associated with mind-body therapy use. Because thought-action fusion is associated with mental health vulnerabilities and magical thinking may play a role in health decision-making, these preliminary findings warrant attention.

Abstract = {Background: Siblings of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia (SPS) are one among the major sources of support for persons with schizophrenia. There is a dearth of psychosocial literature on SPS in India. This qualitative study explored the perspectives about the illness, attitudes, and caregiving experiences of SPS.; Materials and Methods: Qualitative audio-recorded interviews were conducted with 15 SPS, purposively selected from a tertiary mental health hospital of Southern India. A general inductive approach was adopted to analyze the qualitative data.; Results: Four broad themes were identified from qualitative data analysis. (1) SPS described several explanatory models of mental illness in terms of causal attributions and treatment care. (2) They had expressed emotion toward their ill siblings, such as criticality, hostility, and emotional over-involvement. (3) They experienced objective and subjective burden while caring for their ill sibling. In spite of all these, (4) they were part of their ill siblings' care in terms of ensuring regular follow-ups and drug adherence and supported their livelihood. They coped up with adaptive as well as maladaptive strategies.; Conclusion: SPS provide significant support to their affected siblings. However, they do have non-biomedical models of mental illness and negative attitudes toward patients and experience burden. Hence, psychosocial interventions may help SPS while caregiving for their affected siblings.; Competing Interests: There are no conflicts of interest.},

Abstract = {The administration of treatments for nightmares, and more broadly, clinical work with patients reporting dysphoric dreams as a concomitant psychological difficulty, could be improved based on a better understanding of the experience of nightmare sufferers. The objective of this study was to explore the perceptions of nightmare sufferers regarding the functions, causes, and consequences of their nightmares, as well as their strategies for coping with nightmares. Twenty university students with frequent nightmares took part in an individual semi-structured interview constructed by the research team. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Verbatim were analysed using a content analysis method. Four major findings emerge from this study. Firstly, the main perceived causes of nightmares, including one’s occupational and social life, support the hypothesis that dreams reflect waking concerns. Secondly, nightmares tend to decrease sleep quality and to provoke sleep fragmentation, which may be aggravated by sleep avoidance and voluntary awakening from lucid nightmares. In turn, the fatigue that results from a disturbed sleep can negatively affect concentration, daily functioning and mood. Thirdly, nightmares can impact emotions upon awakening and during the day, directly and indirectly, through various mechanisms. Fourthly, nightmares are frequently perceived as a source of personal insight: half of the participants believe that their dreams can reveal information about themselves, searching for the meaning of nightmares is one of the most common coping strategies, and many participants experienced a reflection or realization following a nightmare. A model is proposed to integrate the findings and explain how the nightmare problem might perpetuate itself. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Depression is a leading cause of ill-health and disability globally and encouraging help-seeking and treatment engagement is a key priority of health authorities worldwide. Causal attributions for mental illness have numerous attitudinal and behavioural consequences; however, limited research has explored their implications for attitudes to treatment. This study experimentally investigates the impact of causal attributions for depression on attitudes to specific help-seeking and treatment options. Methods: In an online study, 196 participants read a vignette that emphasised either biological, social or biopsychosocial causes of a character's depression. Participants rated several help-seeking and treatment options on how helpful or harmful they would be for the individual described in the vignette and for themselves personally. Results: The causal attribution manipulation significantly affected treatment attitudes. Relative to social attributions, emphasising biological causes of depression significantly decreased the perceived helpfulness of lifestyle-based treatments, but did not affect attitudes to psychotherapeutic or medical treatment options. Participants rated most help-seeking and treatment options as less helpful for themselves compared to the vignette character. Participants with personal experience of depression had lower confidence in informal sources of help-seeking and greater confidence in medical treatment. Limitations: Limitations include reliance on self-report measures and low reliability of certain sub-scales. Conclusions: These findings suggest emphasising the biological underpinnings of depression could deter people from engaging with lifestyle-based treatment options. Promoting biopsychosocial theories of depression could increase awareness about the multifactorial causes of depression without negatively impacting the perceived efficacy of any help-seeking or intervention options.

Abstract = {Explanatory models (EMs) for illness are highly relevant for patients, and they are also important for clinical diagnoses and treatment. EMs serve to capture patients' personal illness narratives and can help reveal how culture influences these narratives. While much research has aimed to understand EMs in the Western hemisphere, less research has been done on other cultures. Therefore, we investigated local causal attributions for mental illness in Cuba because of its particular history and political system. Although Cuban culture shares many values with Latin American cultures because of Spanish colonization, it is unique because of its socialist political and economic context, which might influence causal attributions. Thus, we developed a qualitative interview outline based on the Clinical Ethnographic Interview and administered interviews to 14 psychiatric patients in Havana. We conducted a thematic analysis to identify repeated patterns of meaning. Six patterns of causal attribution for mental illness were identified: (1) Personal shortcomings, (2) Family influences, (3) Excessive demands, (4) Cultural, economic, and political environment in Cuba, (5) Physical causes, and (6) Symptom-related explanations. In our sample, we found general and Cuba-specific patterns of causal attributions, whereby the Cuba-specific themes mainly locate the causes of mental illness outside the individual. These findings might be related to Cubans' socio-centric personal orientation, the cultural value of familismo and common daily experiences within socialist Cuban society. We discuss how the findings may be related to social stigma and help-seeking behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Voice-hearers tend to face a high degree of stigma that can impact subjective well-being and social functioning. However, researchers have hypothesized that the content of the voice-hearing experience and its cultural context are relevant to stigma responses. This study experimentally tested how perceptions of voice-hearing experiences change as a function of the voice’s content and the perceiver’s characteristics. Method: In total, 143 nonclinical participants were presented with vignettes describing people who heard voices that were attributed to either 'God' or 'Abraham Lincoln' and were described as either complimentary/encouraging or insulting/threatening. For each vignette, participants were asked about the likelihood that the voice-hearer had schizophrenia or mental illness. The Causal Beliefs Questionnaire was also delivered, with two new subscales added to test for belief in positive and negative religious causes for the voices. Stigma was measured by perceived dan)},

Abstract = {Background: An extensive body of research exists looking at the level of psychological distress in populations affected by political conflict. Recommended response to psychological distress in humanitarian crises is still based on frameworks for interventions developed in western/European contexts including psychological first aid, counselling and group therapy. While there is growing, but limited, evidence that culturally modified interventions can lead to reduction in symptoms of psychological distress in conflict affected populations, there is a need to understand mental health help-seeking behaviour and mental health service needs from the perspective of affected communities.; Methods: This study employed a qualitative exploratory research design based on principles of grounded theory. A combination of convenience and snowball sampling was used to recruit 186 adults from the general population to 20 focus group discussions; 95 men, median age 40 years, interquartile range (IQR): 27-48 years and 91 women, median age 40 years IQR: 32-50 years. Trained Kashmiri facilitators used a semi-structured interview guide to ascertain community perceptions on mental illness, help-seeking and service needs from the perspective of communities in the Kashmir Valley. Content analysis of transcripts resulted in the identification of seven overarching themes.; Results: Common locally recognized symptoms of psychological distress were synonymous with symptoms listed in the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-25) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Protracted political insecurity was highlighted as a major perceived cause of psychological distress in communities. Mental health help-seeking included traditional/spiritual healers in combination with practitioners of western medicine, with access highlighted as the main barrier. Divergent views were expressed on the effectiveness of treatment received. Participants' expressed the need for investment in mental health literacy to improve the community's capacity to recognize and support those suffering from psychological distress.; Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the universality of symptoms of psychological distress whilst simultaneously highlighting the importance of recognizing the cultural, spiritual and contextual framework within which psychological distress is understood and manifest. Co-constructed models of community based mental health services are needed.; Competing Interests: Competing interestsAll authors declare they have no competing interests. (© The Author(s). 2019.)},

Abstract = {New Zealand has the highest suicide rate amongst youth (ages 15-24) in the OECD. We aimed to conduct a conceptual replication of two previous studies, examining the views that youth in New Zealand hold about the causes of youth suicide, possible solutions, and help-seeking. One hundred university students aged 18 to 24 completed a mixed-methods online survey; 89% were female. One of four hypotheses was supported: Students who were personally aware of another student's suicidality were more willing to seek help for others from the university counselling service. Qualitative findings indicated that bullying and stigma were the most commonly perceived causes of youth suicide, and improvement of mental health services was the most frequently recommended solution. The views of youth should be included in the future development of mental health services and policies aimed at reducing suicide rates for this population.

Abstract = {Background: Symptomatology differences of major depressive disorder (MDD) in psychiatric and general hospitals in China leads to possible misdiagnosis. Looking at the symptomatology of first-visit patients with MDD in different mental health services, and identifying predictors of health-seeking behavior using machine learning may help to improve diagnostic accuracy. Methods: 1500 patients first diagnosed with MDD were recruited from 16 psychiatric hospitals and 16 general hospitals across China. Socio-demographic characteristics, causal attribution, symptoms of depression within and outside Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) framework were collected using a self-made questionnaire. A predictive model of 62 variables was established using Random forest, symptom frequencies of patients in general hospitals and psychiatric hospitals were compared. Results: The machine learning approach revealed that symptoms were strong predictors of health-seeking behavior among patients with MDD. General hospitals patients had higher frequencies of suicidal ideation (χ² = 15.230, p < 0.001), psychosis (χ² = 14.264, p < 0.001), weight change (all p < 0.001), hypersomnia (χ² = 25.940, p < 0.001), and a tendency of denying emotional/cognitive symptoms compared with psychiatric hospitals patients. Limitations: Stigma and preference bias were not measured. Severity of current depressive episodes was not assessed. Data of previous episode(s) was not presented. Conclusions: Symptom evaluation targeting specific patient population in different hospitals is crucial for diagnostic accuracy. Suicide prevention reliant on collaboration between general hospitals and psychiatric hospitals is required in the future construction of Chinese mental health system.

Abstract = {Past research has established that different causal explanations for mental illness have small but unique effects on various components of mental illness stigma. Research has indicated that explanations that attribute mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, to biogenetic causes, as opposed to psychosocial causes, lead the public to direct less blame towards affected individuals, but to express greater pessimism regarding these individuals' prognosis. Given these mixed findings, variables that might mitigate negative effects or enhance the positive effects of various causal explanations for mental illness on stigma have become of interest. The present study investigated whether psychological inflexibility, which has been shown to be positively associated with mental illness stigma, moderates the relationship between causal explanations and multiple components of stigma. Participants included 558 adults, ages 18 or older, recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants answered questions about their personality and personal beliefs, read one of three different vignettes about a hypothetical character with schizophrenia, which attributed the character's condition to either biogenetic, psychosocial, or uncertain causes, and completed questions that assessed stigma towards the vignette character. It was hypothesized that, compared to those who were afforded a psychosocial explanation for the vignette character's condition, participants who were given a biogenetic explanation would ascribe less blame to the character but endorse greater prognostic pessimism. It was also hypothesized that more psychologically inflexible participants would be more stigmatizing of the vignette character than those who were less psychologically inflexible. Finally, it was hypothesized that psychological inflexibility would moderate the relationship between causal explanations and stigma. A one-way MANCOVA was conducted to test the study hypotheses and univariate tests of between-subject effects were conducted as follow up. Results indicated mixed support for study hypotheses; the different causal explanations did not impact stigma towards the vignette character and psychological inflexibility did not serve as a moderator, but psychological inflexibility did have an effect on multiple components of stigma. Implications of these findings for stigma reduction efforts and future research on the relationship between psychological inflexibility and stigma are discussed.

Abstract = {This study investigated dyadic perceptions of the causes of mental health symptoms within dating couples. We tested the extent to which a participant’s beliefs about their romantic partner’s attributions about mental health were accurate and/or biased and the extent to which causal attributions about mental health predicted relationship quality. Ninety-four dyads (N = 188) reported on biological and psychological causes of mental health symptoms and relationship conflict and support. Consistent with hypotheses, the actor–partner interdependence model revealed more bias than accuracy in perceptions of the causes of mental health symptoms. Results also showed more effects of causal attributions on relationship quality for the romantic partner than for the participant with symptoms and more effects of controllable psychological causes on relationship quality relative to uncontrollable psychological or any biological causes. While relationship quality was generally positive, endorsement of most causes of mental health symptoms predicted higher conflict and lower support. These accuracy and bias effects as well as the effects on the romantic partner affirm the importance of studying both members of the romantic relationship because they would have been missed completely if only studying the participant with mental health symptoms. In terms of clinical practice, working with couples whose attributions align might look differently than working with couples who are not so aligned.

Abstract = {Background: Fear of autism has led to a decline in childhood-immunization uptake and to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases. Identifying characteristics of parents who believe in a causal role of vaccines for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in their child may help targeting educational activities and improve adherence to the immunization schedule.; Objectives: To compare caregivers of children with ASD who agree or disagree that vaccines play an etiological role in autism for 1) socio-demographics characteristics and 2) developmental and clinical profiles of their children.; Methods: Data from 16,525 participants with ASD under age 18 were obtained from SPARK, a national research cohort started in 2016. Caregivers completed questionnaires at registration that included questions on beliefs about the etiologic role of childhood immunizations and other factors in ASD. Data were available about family socio-demographic characteristics, first symptoms of autism, developmental regression, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, seizures, and current levels of functioning.; Results: Participants with ASD were 80.4% male with a mean age of 8.1 years (SD = 4.1). Overall, 16.5% of caregivers endorsed immunizations as perceived causes of autism. Compared to caregivers who disagreed with vaccines as a cause for ASD, those who believed in vaccine causation came disproportionately from ethnic minority, less educated, and less wealthy backgrounds. More often their children had experienced developmental regression involving language and other skills, were diagnosed earlier, had lost skills during the second year of life, and had worse language, adaptive, and cognitive outcomes.; Conclusion: One in six caregivers who participate in a national research cohort believe that child immunizations could be a cause of autism in their child. Parent social background (non-White, less educated) and child developmental features (regression in second year, poorer language skills, and worse adaptive outcomes) index caregivers who are more likely to harbor these beliefs and could benefit from targeted educational activities.; Competing Interests: Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Dr. E.

Abstract = {The individual and social construction of psychological distress is fundamental to help-seeking and the extent to which interventions are seen as credible. Where pluralistic attributions for mental health problems predominate, the development of global mental health (GMH) interventions in the form of task-shifting approaches create increased access to new ways of understanding and responding to distress. However, little is known about how participants in these initiatives manage these encounters. This qualitative study in Malawi explored village-based health workers’ (HSAs) and patients’ and carers’ views of the causes of distress and how these beliefs influenced help-seeking and the health workers’ response. Eight HSAs and nine paired patients/carers were interviewed separately to enable each of nine experiences of distress to be explored. Findings revealed a complex set of personal, social and cultural influences that informed causative attributions and help-seeking decisions. Patients/carers viewed psychosocial stresses as compelling explanations and readily reported others attributing their distress to supernatural causes (bewitchment). Yet attributional beliefs alone were not the only influence over help-seeking, which evolved pragmatically in response to the impact of treatments and social pressure for conformity. In turn HSAs navigated the interactions with patients/carers by emphasising the biomedical approach and discrediting bewitchment attributions. This caused tensions when biomedical interventions were unhelpful or the traditional healers’ approach proved beneficial. Conclusions add to the call for such task-shifting approaches to work with communities to discern authentic and practical responses to mental distress that mirror the ‘pluralism and pragmatism’ found in the communities they serve.

Abstract = {In almost all countries the public prefers psycho-social explanations of ‘schizophrenia’ to bio-genetic ones. The causal explanations of people who experience psychosis have been under-researched, and, if they diverge from the dominant bio-genetic paradigm, can be dismissed as ‘lack of insight’. 701 people, from 30 countries, who completed an online survey about their experiences on antipsychotics, answered an open question about what had caused the problems for which they had been prescribed the drugs. On a 'Bio-Social' likert scale, from 1 = ‘Purely Biological’ to 5 = ‘Purely Social’, the mean score was 4.24. Thematic analysis of 1,063 causal statements produced seven themes: Social (49.9%), Psychological (12.1%), Bio-genetic (11.6%), Iatrogenic (11.3%), Drug and Alcohol (6.7%), Medical Condition (4.5%) and Insomnia (4.0%). Respondents were 13 times more likely to report predominantly or exclusively Social causes as to report predominantly or exclusively Bio-genetic causes. Those with a psychosis diagnosis were even more likely than others to report a Social cause. The causal beliefs of this sample are consistent with previous studies of people diagnosed with ‘schizophrenia’ and the beliefs of the public. They are also aligned with recent research into the social causes of psychosis. It is argued that rather than dismiss the beliefs as ‘lack of insight’ it is more respectful and productive to listen carefully and adjust our understandings and services accordingly.

Abstract = {Background: The main purpose of this study was to investigate the perception of schizophrenia in different categories of persons (directly and/or indirectly) involved with it. Hypotheses were made concerning the definition of a multi-class structure where each class should identify a profile characteristic of each respondent’s specific role, (e.g.: mental health professional, relative, patient, and student) and specific indicators of schizophrenia (e.g.: causal beliefs, eligible treatments, social distance, perceived dangerousness and public avoidance). Methods: This study involved 577 participants all in contact with schizophrenia with different roles. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was applied to define a latent structure of schizophrenia aspects. Such structure was expected be affected by the interaction between respondents’ roles, as external variable, and schizophrenia indicators as manifest variables. Results: A four-latent-class structure representing the four respondents’ roles was evidenced, further each class was characterized by schizophrenia indicators representing a profile for each role. Analogies and differences of views and preferences of the respondents’ roles concerning schizophrenia emerged clearly. Conclusions: The four groups of people involved with schizophrenia with different roles demonstrated to interact significantly with specific indicators of schizophrenia shedding new lights on the understanding of schizophrenia in its complexity.

Abstract = {Causal attributions of mental illness have received substantial attention given their influence on help-seeking patterns of individuals and the level of engagement with health services. Few studies, however, have examined caregivers’ perspectives of their relatives’ illness. The current study aimed to examine caregivers’ causal attributions of their relatives’ mental illness and its association with perceived stigma in a multi-ethnic Asian sample. Primary caregivers (N = 350) of psychiatric outpatients were recruited from a psychiatric hospital. The attribution and stigma sections of the Family Interview Schedule (FIS) were utilized to obtain caregivers’ causal report of their relatives’ illness and stigma perception. Logistic regressions were performed to examine the socio-demographic and diagnostic correlates of the four categories of causal attributions (psychosocial, biological, drug-/substance use-related, supernatural). The majority of caregivers identified psychosocial causes, followed by biological, supernatural, and lastly drug-/substance use-related causes for their relatives’ illness. Marital status, religion, employment status and the diagnosis of depressive disorders were significant correlates of biological attributions. Ethnicity and not knowing their relatives' diagnosis were significantly associated with psychosocial attributions. For drug-/substance use-related attributions, ethnicity was the only significant correlate. Supernatural attributions did not yield any significant associations. Caregivers who endorsed drug-/substance use-related reasons also reported significantly higher stigma than caregivers who did not endorse these attributions. A tendency to endorse biological and psychosocial causes for their relative’s illness was noted among caregivers. Further research on caregivers’ causal attributions is warranted to account for and replicate current study findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Inter‐professional collaboration remains a significant concern within healthcare and social care. However, there has been scant attention paid to practices at the interface of clinicians and carers, namely foster carers and residential carers. The present study considers child and adolescent self‐harm management and prevention practices as a site of empirical interest due to reports that multi‐agency teams are not effectively operating. Drawing upon a grounded theory approach, data were generated via semi‐structured interviews and focus groups with residential carers (n = 15) and foster carers (n = 15) in Wales. Themes were developed through axial coding. The results present two central themes to explain the nature and perceived causes of inter‐professional discord. First, there are clear contestations in expertise, with carers challenging clinicians’ propositional knowledge in favour of their own experiential expertise. However, participants simultaneously endorse medical dominance, which contributes to their sense of disempowerment and marginalisation. Second, is the preclusion of carers’ professional identity, primarily due to inadequate professionalisation procedures. Meanwhile, the privileging of their parenting role is perceived to support the perpetuation of courtesy stigma. Carers are then compelled to undertake the effortful labour of legitimisation. Together these thematic insights provide direction on mechanisms to improve inter‐professional interactions, notably around training and accreditation.

Abstract = {Introduction: How and why people in a particular setting turn to a specific coping strategy for their distress is pivotal for strengthening mental healthcare and this needs to be understood from a local point of view. Prior research in northern Rwanda documented common local concepts of distress for the population that cannot receive assistance despite severe adversities; however, the locally-perceived causes, manifestation and coping strategies and their associations are still unclear.; Methods: The qualitative study in the Musanze district, northern Rwanda, was informed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. In-depth interviews were conducted with people with lived experience and those in close contact with people with lived experience of distress. Ethnographic observation was conducted and the analyses were complimented by an earlier ethnography in the same village.; Results: Study participants (n=15) included community members with lived experience of mental distress and/or those with close friends or family with lived experience. The perceived manifestations of the mental distresses were diverse and the causal attributions shifted from more social, concrete and explainable (eg, loss) towards magical, more abstract and unexplainable (eg, poisoning). Finally, participants sought coping strategies in accordance with their causal attribution in ways that made sense to them.; Conclusion: The coping strategies were chosen according to the perceived aetiology of the symptoms and they were perceived to be effective for their distress. Local coping strategies that match people's help-seeking patterns should therefore be supported in policy and programmes. In Rwanda this requires a mutual training of medical professionals and traditional healers and establishing co-treatment within two parallel systems. This also requires the support for programmes and initiatives that strengthen positive interactions and change in circumstances.; Competing Interests: Competing interests: None declared.

Abstract = {Background: Negative perception and attitude of community prevents many people with depression and their caregivers from seeking help and receiving adequate treatment due to fear of social reaction and may try to hide the illness. The reasons for negative attitudes are not consistent across communities or cultures. Therefore, understanding the level of community perception and attitude towards people with depression is important to develop an intervention to reduce the impact of mental illness.; Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly selected adults. The data was collected using structured, pre-tested, and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics like frequency, mean, and median were performed. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors that affect the community attitude towards people with depression.; Results: Of the study population, 325(52.7%) had a good perception and 246(39.9%) had a positive attitude towards people with depression. The majority of study participants frequently identified as the perceived cause of depression was substance misuse, loss of loved one, and conflict within a family. In addition, psychosocial treatment was the most preferred treatment for people with depression in the study area. Marital status and educational status were significantly associated with the community attitude towards people with depression.; Conclusion: Giving special attention to people with substance misuse, loss of loved one, and conflict within a family is very vital for the prevention of depression. In addition, future mental health promotion activities should focus on cause and common manifestation of depression to improve the attitude toward people with depression.

Undergraduate students (N = 241) were assigned to read one of eight vignettes (mental illness x gender) and completed quantitative stigma measures (e.g., social distance). Results showed that alcohol addiction was the most stigmatized, followed closely by gambling addiction. Sexual addiction and depression had similar levels of stigma.

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: Providing appropriate and culturally sensitive care to the rapidly growing number of U.S. Latinx older adults with psychiatric conditions presents a major public health challenge. We know little about older Latinx adults' perceived causes of mental health problems, offering clinicians limited insight to guide successful and culturally congruent treatment. Moreover, there is a paucity of mental health research examining heterogeneity in how Latinx individuals may attribute mental health symptoms. The present study sought to identify how Latinx and non-Latinx older adults attributed the sources of their mental health problems and how these types of attributions differ by ethnicity.; Research Design and Methods: This study analyzed data collected from a retrospective chart review and survey of 673 adults aged 55-95 years (430 Mexican origin and 244 non-Latinx) from a rural psychiatric outpatient clinic near the California-Mexico border. We conducted stratified latent class analysis (LCA) by race/ethnicity to explore the mental health attribution beliefs of Mexican-origin and non-Latinx clinic patients.; Results: Different LCA patterns for Mexican-origin Latinx versus non-Latinx groups were found. For non-Latinx adults, there was a class of individuals who attributed their mental health issues to social and financial problems. For Mexican-origin adults, there was a class of individuals who attributed their mental health issues to spiritual and/or supernatural factors, unaffected by acculturation level, depressive symptom severity, and time spent in the United States, but differing by gender. We found within-group heterogeneity: Not all Mexican-origin or non-Latinx older adults were alike in how they conceptualized their mental health.; Discussion and Implications: Mexican-origin Latinx and non-Latinx older adults attributed their mental health issues to different causes. More Mexican-origin older adults attributed their symptoms to spiritual causes, even after controlling for contextual factors. Further research is needed to determine whether attribution beliefs are affected by specific mental health diagnoses and other cultural factors not measured in this study. (© The Author(s) 2020.

Abstract = {Objectives: A considerable proportion of those who suffer from mental illnesses in Singapore do not seek any form of professional help. The reluctance to seek professional help could be due to misconceptions about the causes of mental illnesses. Research has shown that help-seeking attitudes can predict actual service use. As young adults are most at risk of developing mental illnesses, this study aims to elucidate the impact of causal beliefs about mental illness on help-seeking attitudes among university students in Singapore.; Design: Prior to attending an anti-stigma intervention, data on the Causal Beliefs about Mental Illness, Inventory of Attitudes towards Seeking Mental Health services and questions pertaining to sociodemographic background were collected from participants using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions were performed to examine the relationship between causal beliefs and help-seeking, as well as their sociodemographic correlates.; Settings: A university in Singapore.; Participants: 390 students who were studying in a University in Singapore.; Results: Younger age was associated with higher scores on psychosocial attribution, while prior social contact with individuals with mental illness was significantly associated with lower scores on personality attribution. With regard to help-seeking attitudes; being a male and personality attribution were significantly associated with lower scores on 'Psychological Openness' and 'Indifference to Stigma', while psychosocial attribution was significantly associated with higher scores on 'Help-seeking Propensity'. Having prior social contact also predicted higher 'Psychological Openness', while being in Year 2 and 3 predicted lower scores on 'Indifference to Stigma'.; Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that help-seeking attitudes might be influenced by causal beliefs, with personality attribution being the most impairing. Hence, to reduce the wide treatment gap in Singapore, anti-stigma interventions targeting young people could focus on addressing beliefs that attribute mental illness to the personality of the individual.; Competing Interests: Competing interests: None Declared.

Abstract = {Background: In recent years there is a growing interest in public beliefs about mental disorders. Numerous representative population-based studies have been conducted around the globe, also in European countries bordering on the Mediterranean Sea. However, relatively little is known about public beliefs in countries in Northern Africa.; Objective: To fill this gap by comparing public beliefs about mental disorders in Tunisia and Germany, focusing on causal beliefs, help-seeking recommendations and treatment preferences.; Methods: Representative national population-based surveys have been conducted in Tunisia in 2012 (N = 811) and in Germany in 2011 (N = 1852), using the same interview mode and the same fully structured interview starting with a vignette depicting a person suffering from either schizophrenia or depression.; Results: In Tunisia, the public was more likely to adopt psychosocial and to reject biogenetic explanations than in Germany. Correspondingly, psychological treatments were more frequently recommended and biological ones more frequently advised against. There was also a strong inclination to share religious beliefs and to recommend seeking religious advice. Tunisians tended much more than Germans to hold moralistic views and to blame the afflicted person for his or her illness. In Tunisia, the public tended less to differentiate between schizophrenia and depression than in Germany.; Conclusion: Marked differences between Tunisia and Germany exist in public beliefs about the causes of mental disorders and their treatment, which correspond to differences in cultural orientations prevailing in these countries. Mental health professionals need to be sensitive to the particular cultural context in which they operate, in order to be able to reach those they intend to care for. (© 2020 Angermeyer et al.)},

Abstract = {Background: The consequences of schizophrenia stigma are numerous and highly damaging to individuals, their families, the health care system and society. Mental health professionals (MHP) are considered to be one of the main sources of stigmatization. Objectives: To identify the characteristics of MHP stigma in schizophrenia in comparison with other psychiatric disorders, the specificities of MHP compared with other social groups, and associated factors. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched multiple electronic databases for articles: (i) reporting original data published in English in peer-reviewed journals, (ii) reporting quantitative data with statistical analysis, (iii) assessing stigma in a broad sense, and (iv) including samples composed only of MHP. Results: A total of 38 articles published from 1999 to 2019 and involving 10,926 MHP fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Studies showed that schizophrenia is the most stigmatized mental illnesses in MHP, despite recent results suggesting that borderline personality disorder and substance abuse may be more stigmatized. In comparison with other social groups, MHP reported less dangerousness beliefs and more positive beliefs regarding pharmacological treatment. Nevertheless, results were less consistent regarding prognosis and desire for social distance. Age, education level, type of mental health profession, or length of practice were associated factors that showed inconsistent relations with stigma. Work setting and biological causal beliefs were more clearly associated with MHP stigma. Conclusion: These findings provide strong support for the need to conduct specific research on schizophrenia stigma in MHP and the importance of controlling for several variables to identify predictors of stigma.

Abstract = {ABSTRACT The saying 'mental illness is like any other illness' has increasingly become pervasive in promoting mental health literacy among the public in China. This discourse is based on the fact that mental illness is attributed to primarily biogenetic causes. This study comprises an investigation of the impact of causal attributions of mental illness on the social withdrawal inclination of people with chronic mental illnesses (PCMIs) in China. Drawing on attribution theory and a sample of PCMIs, the current authors further question the effectiveness of biogenetic discourse to combat social stigma and to integrate PCMIs into society. In addition, in response to the proliferation of discussion on the digital inclusion of those with mental disabilities, this study constructs a structural model in which the varied effects of supportive communication are used as bridging factors, including face-to-face, telephonic and social media communication. The results indicate a stronger social withdrawal inclination when the PCMIs attributed their illnesses to biogenetic causes. In addition, biogenetic attribution was also found to potentially hinder the PCMIs from using the telephone and social media to seek supportive communication, while psychosocial attribution was found to have potential to combat PCMIs’ social withdrawal inclination. In this vein, this study calls for further investigation on the conditional factors upon which digital inclusion might work for PCMIs in China.

Abstract = {Background: Mental health disorders have identified as being one of the public health issues throughout the world. Recent evidence reveals that more than 21 million people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, there is little information about community perception and attitude towards people with Schizophrenia in Ethiopia.; Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the community perception and attitude towards people with Schizophrenia among residents of Arba Minch Zuria Districts, Southern Ethiopia.; Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly selected adults. Interviewer-administered standard tool was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics like frequency, mean, and median computed. A binary logistic regression model used to identify factors affecting community perception and attitude towards people with schizophrenia.; Results: Of the study population, 469 (76%) of respondents had good perception and 390 (63.2%) had positive attitudes towards people with schizophrenia. The study participants identified talkativeness and self-neglect behaviors as the most common manifestations of schizophrenia. Besides, this study identified substance misuse and head injury as the perceived cause and spiritual or traditional methods as a preferred treatment for people with schizophrenia. Moreover, the study participants preferred spiritual or traditional methods for the treatment of schizophrenia. Young age [AOR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.21, 3.40], females [AOR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.58, 3.41], good perception towards people with schizophrenia [AOR=4.95, 95% CI: 3.25, 7.54] and no formal educational status [AOR=2.75, 95% CI: 1.33, 5.70], and primary education [AOR=3.72, 95% CI: 1.87, 7.39] were significantly associated with the attitude towards people with schizophrenia.; Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that approximately one-third of the residents had unfavorable attitudes towards people with schizophrenia. Therefore, giving special attention to male, elders and those who were educated, and individuals who have poor perceptions of people with schizophrenia is crucial.; Competing Interests: The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.

Abstract = {Improving knowledge about childhood mental health issues, reducing stigma, and encouraging appropriate treatment-seeking are important goals for public health. This study examined the effect of treatment and malleability information on stigmatisation towards children with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and their parents, and on endorsements of causal beliefs. In an experimental study, university students (N = 234) were randomly allocated to receive/not receive treatment information (information on the existence and effectiveness of treatment for ODD) and to receive/not receive malleability information (information emphasising brain malleability and the potential to change). Participants then rated four measures of stigma towards a fictitious child with ODD and mother (blame, incompetence, dangerousness, and social distance), and rated their endorsements of causal explanations for ODD. Neither treatment nor malleability information had significant effects on stigmatisation towards either the child or mother. However, this information did impact upon causal beliefs about ODD as stemming from biological or mixed biological/environmental causes. Implications for the future development of public health initiatives and stigma research on childhood mental health are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Attributing mental illness to genetic factors has been shown to reduce blame; however, doing so may create other negative attitudes. Genetic attributions can increase the desire to remain distant from someone with a mental illness (desire for social distance), reduce one’s beliefs that an ill person can get better (prognostic pessimism), and cause people living with mental illness to be perceived as more dangerous. Presenting information about how mental illnesses can be treated alongside a genetic causal attribution may combat these negative side effects. Participants (N = 268) were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to read vignettes about a man ('John') with schizophrenia. Participants randomly received either a genetic or environmental attribution for John’s illness, and then received treatability information or no information. A genetic explanation of schizophrenia led people to believe that the symptoms of schizophrenia described in the vignette were more permanent, p < .01, ηp²= .07; however, this finding was qualified by a significant interaction where the type of attribution had no impact on prognostic pessimism when presented with treatability information, p = .04, ηp² = .01. The present findings suggest the potential importance of emphasizing treatability information for disorders that are perceived to be genetically influenced.

Abstract = {Objectives: To examine the causal beliefs about schizophrenia of non‐psychiatric doctors and whether differential belief in biogenetic vs. psychosocial causes influences doctors’ views about treatments and prognosis. Design and methods: Three hundred and five non‐psychiatric doctors working in outpatient community centres completed the ‘Opinions on mental disorders Questionnaire’ after reading a clinical description of people with schizophrenia. Results: The factors most frequently reported as causes of schizophrenia were heredity (65.2%) and use of street drugs (54.1%). Seventy‐five per cent of participants endorsed both one or more biological causal factors and one or more psychosocial causal factors. Of the 264 participants who expressed their opinion about the most important cause of schizophrenia, 53.8% indicated a biogenetic cause. Fifty‐two per cent of respondents thought it ‘completely true’ that drugs are useful in schizophrenia, and 33.9% thought it ‘completely true’ that people with schizophrenia must take drugs all their life. Participants stating that the most important cause was biogenetic more frequently recommended a psychiatrist and less frequently a psychologist. Compared to doctors who indicated a psychosocial cause as the most important one, those who indicated a biogenetic cause were more sceptical about recovery, more confident in the usefulness of drugs, and more convinced of the need of lifelong pharmacological treatments in schizophrenia. Conclusions: These findings suggest the need to provide some doctors with training on the multiple, interacting causes of schizophrenia and the efficacy of the broad range of available treatments. The education of health professionals regarding stigma and its effects on clinical practice is also needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Over the past three decades, a range of international stakeholders have highlighted the possibility that genomic research may impact stigma associated with psychiatric disorders. Limited research has been conducted in Africa to investigate this relation. Method: In the present study, using focus group discussions, we explored the relation between genetic attribution and stigma among 36 Xhosa people with schizophrenia. We addressed three main questions: (1) What causal beliefs do Xhosa people with schizophrenia use to explain their illness and to what extent do genetic explanations play a role in these beliefs? (2) What are the internalised stigma experiences of Xhosa people with schizophrenia? (3) How do genetic explanations relate to stigma experiences, if at all? Results: Most participants were able to define genetics and some linked genetics to disease causation. Despite adequate knowledge of genetics and an emphasis on genetic explanations of schizophrenia in the study, most participants held a multitude of causal explanations including: psychosocial, environmental, and cultural. Moreover, participants rarely mentioned disease cause when describing their stigma experiences. Discussion: For this population group, there was no straight-forward relation between a genetic attribution and stigma. Therefore, we did not find evidence that genetic attribution may significantly increase stigma. Although North American and European literature provides conflicting evidence regarding this relation, there is increased consensus that biomedical explanations for psychiatric disorders may reduce blame. This study found evidence supporting that consensus. This study provides an empirical foundation to inform ongoing work on the psychosocial implications of psychiatric genomics research in non-Western contexts.

Abstract = {While parent training often focuses on teaching parents of children with Autism Sepctrum Disorders (ASD) specific skills to address their child’s problem behavior, it has often overlooked factors related to parents’ own mental health and well-being, such as how they think and feel about their child’s behavior and their parenting. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of positive family intervention (PFI), a parent training program which combines cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with family based positive behavior support (PBS), on parents’ cognitions and children’s problem behavior for families of children with ASD. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across three mothers was used to examine the impact of PFI on parent-reported stress, self-efficacy, attributions, rational and irrational beliefs, pessimism, and ratings of child behavior problems. Each mother received eight weekly 90-minute PFI sessions without the child present. Findings demonstrated significant decreases in parent ratings of problem behavior as well as observed child problem behavior for all three families, though visual analysis showed only modest change in parent-reported problem behavior for one of those three mothers, and direct observation data was only collected pre- and post-intervention. Two of the three mothers reported significant decreases in dysfunctional child- and parent-causal attributions, irrational beliefs, and pessimistic thoughts. In addition, one of those two mothers reported improvements in parental stress and self-efficacy. This study suggests that there may be benefits to incorporating CBT with PBS in terms of affecting parents’ perceptions of their children and themselves. Factors potentially contributing to or limiting the effectiveness of PFI for each participant are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study explored views of Catholic priests about schizophrenia and depression in Italy. Participants completed a questionnaire on their views about either schizophrenia (N = 282) or depression (N = 277). The depression group was surer than the schizophrenia group that: the disorder was due to psychosocial causes; curable; non-requiring long-term pharmacotherapy; the persons with depression could participate in religious activities. The older priests were more convinced than the younger priests that: the prayer and long-term pharmacotherapy are useful; the persons with mental disorders had affective difficulties, are recognizable and kept at distance. Priests should receive education on stigma in mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Misperception that an established, gradual-onset disease such as osteoarthritis started when the symptoms were first noticed might lead to testing and treatment choices that are inconsistent with what matters most to a patient. In the present study, the primary null hypothesis was that there are no factors associated with patient-reported symptom duration (in months). The secondary null hypotheses were that there are no factors independently associated with (1) a sudden versus gradual perception of disease onset, (2) an event or injury-related versus age-related perceived cause of disease onset, and (3) the magnitude of physical limitations.; Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 121 patients with an atraumatic, established, gradual-onset condition of the upper extremity completed a demographic questionnaire, measures of mental health (symptoms of depression and anxiety, worst-case thinking, and self-efficacy [the ability to adapt and continue with daily activity] when in pain), measurement of the magnitude of upper extremity-specific limitations, and questions about the perceived course and cause of the disease.; Results: The median patient-reported symptom duration was 12 months (interquartile range, 3 to 36 months). Twenty-two patients (18%) perceived their disease as new, and 29 patients (24%) believed that the condition was related to ≥1 event (injury) rather than being time and age-related. In multivariable analysis, patients with Medicare insurance were independently associated with longer reported symptom duration (in months). Greater self-efficacy was associated with longer symptom duration in bivariate, but not multivariable, analysis. No factors were independently associated with a sudden versus gradual onset of symptoms. Hispanic ethnicity and federal, county, or no insurance were independently associated with the perception that the problem was caused by an injury or event.; Conclusions: Approximately 1 in 5 patients misperceived new symptoms as representing a new disease, often as a type of injury. Misperception of the pathology as new had a limited association with unhealthy thoughts and is likely generally responsive to reorientation. We speculate that gentle, strategic reorientation of misperception can protect patients from choices inconsistent with their values.; Competing Interests: Disclosure: The authors indicated that no external funding was received for any aspect of this work.

Abstract = {Background: Diminished mental health is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and may contribute to loss of independence and motivation in patients receiving dialysis and their caregivers. Increased understanding of the patient perspective on triggers, impacts and strategies for managing mental health may inform ways to address mental health conditions in this population.; Methods: A secondary thematic analysis was undertaken using data from the Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology (SONG)-Hemodialysis and SONG-Peritoneal Dialysis projects. We extracted and analysed data on the perceived causes, meaning, impact and management of mental health in patients receiving dialysis from 26 focus groups (in six countries), multinational Delphi surveys and consensus workshops.; Results: A total of 644 patients and caregivers participated. We identified five themes: bound to dialysis (forced into isolation, enslaved to a machine, stress of relentless planning and grieving the loss of a normal life), underrecognized and ignored (missed by health practitioners, need for mental health support), an uncertain future (dreading complications, coming to terms with mortality), developing self-reliance (vulnerability in being solely responsible for dialysis, sustaining motivation for dialysis, necessity for self-vigilance and taking charge to regulate emotions) and responding to a lifestyle overhaul (guilt of burdening family, controlling symptoms for overall mental wellness, protecting independence and trying to feel grateful).; Conclusions: Patients receiving dialysis and their caregivers endure mental and emotional distress attributed to the burden of dialysis, lifestyle restrictions, the constant threat of death and symptom burden, which can impair motivation for self-management. Increased attention to monitoring and management of mental health in this population is needed. (© The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

Abstract = {Employees with caregiving responsibilities often experience work-life interference (WLI), particularly when caring for either disabled persons and/or children. This study examines sample of 288 working Australians from the AWALI national survey data, who care for at least one family member or friend with long-term physical or mental illness, disability, or aging-related problems. We investigated the role of unpaid work at home in predicting WLI, based on a model that included indirect association via inferred causes for working unpaid hours at home and a conditional direct relationship based on number of children. The findings supported our prediction that unpaid work at home is positively associated with WLI but its effect is moderated by number of children. There was a conditional direct effect where employees with care responsibilities experienced a stronger relationship between unpaid hours and WLI when having more children. Further, when the perceived reason for unpaid work was excessively demanding work, the relationship with WLI was stronger. Implications for workers with multiple caregiving responsibilities are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Developing an understanding of teachers' perceptions toward those with mental health challenges will be helpful in working to promote more positive attitudes about mental health and in reducing the development of stigmatizing attitudes in children. The present study primarily explored teachers' stigmatizing attitudes toward those with mental illness and examined the predictive potential of three main factors (i.e., level of previous contact with someone with mental illness, previous education about mental illness, and teachers' beliefs about the causes of mental illness). Using a cross-sectional, web-based survey design, 237 Saskatchewan teachers participated in the study. As expected, significant associations were found in two of the main factors: teachers' beliefs about the causes of mental illness (endogenous and interactional) and the amount of previous contact teachers had with those who were perceived to have mental illness. Higher levels of previous contact and more extreme biological causal beliefs were associated with more stigmatizing attitudes whereas higher levels of social and interactional causal beliefs were associated with less stigmatizing attitudes. In contrast to what was expected, the third main factor investigating the relationship of previous training about mental illness was not significantly associated with stigmatizing beliefs about mental illness in teachers. The amount of previous contact with those who have mental illness and both endogenous and interactional causal beliefs about mental illness were found to be significant predictors of stigmatizing attitudes. Results provide important considerations for teachers' professional development and school-based mental health efforts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Substance use disorders (SUDs) are prevalent and costly, both economically and in terms of human suffering. Despite this, the graduate curriculum for psychologists has no required course in substance abuse treatment and there is a shortage of psychologists who specialize in SUDs. This may, in part, be due to stigma towards those who abuse substances. This online survey study presented three vignettes depicting clients with major depression (MDD), alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse to test licensed clinical psychologists' negative countertransferential reactions and perceived attributional biases to these disorders. It was hypothesized that participants would hold significantly more stigmatizing views of clients with SUDs compared to a client with MDD, and would be more likely to attribute MDD to a chemical imbalance and SUDs to poor willpower. One hundred and forty-one clinical psychologists licensed to practice in the state of California completed the survey. Following each vignette, participants were presented with the Ratings of Emotional Attitudes to Clients by Treaters (REACT) scale, a measure capturing participants' emotional responses to the clients in the vignettes. The Perceived Causes of Vignette Conditions (PCVC) measured participants' attributions about the. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Female veterans are at a higher risk for developing mental health conditions and sexual dysfunctions due to risks related to their military service, including military sexual trauma. This pilot study was conducted with a sample of female veterans who had a primary care provider (PCP) and experienced a sexual functioning concern during the previous 12 months, to explore: a) whether a relationship exists between depression and sexual functioning among a sample of female veterans receiving primary care b) if female veterans' dynamic with PCPs, when controlling for depression, is associated with sexual dysfunction and c) the reasons why female veterans do or do not talk to their PCP about sexual concerns. A total of 32 female veterans completed a web-based survey that assessed for depression (PHQ-9), sexual dysfunction (FSFI), and patient-provider alliance (KAS-R). Military sexual trauma (MST) experiences were common, with 72% of the women reporting sexual harassment in the service and 41% reporting sexual assault. Moreover, women who experienced MST had higher depression scores, poorer sexual functioning, and poorer alliance with their PCPs than women who did experience MST. A moderate relationship was found between depression and sexual functioning. Although 97% of the participants reported being at least a little bothered by their sexual functioning difficulties, only 12.5% had discussed their concerns with their PCP. Patient-provider alliance was not associated with poorer sexual functioning, when controlling for depression; however, depression did vary as a function of patient-provider alliance and sexual functioning. Participants reported their perceived cause of the problem, comfort level, perception of provider's ability, acceptance of the problem, and getting help for the problem as reasons for communicating or not communicating with their PCP about their sexual difficulties. Although the small sample size calls for replication before findings can be generalized, the implications for clinical care as well as the value for future research is clear.

Abstract = {This qualitative study explores the lived experiences of educators who have had two or more direct interactions with therapy dogs in the classroom setting. Specifically, this study seeks to explore the attitudes and beliefs of teachers as it relates to the use of therapy dogs to de-escalate students exhibiting undesirable behaviors. Additionally, this study will seek to discover the benefits and/or challenges the use of therapy dogs bring to the classroom. The research resulted in three major themes emerging: (a) types of undesirable behaviors and perceived causes, (b) skills, strategies, and resources for managing undesirable behaviors, and (c) teachers' understanding of the use of therapy dogs in the educational setting. The study sample consists of nine teachers from an elementary school in South Carolina. This phenomenological study used the qualitative data collection strategies of a focus group and one on one interviews. Interviews were transcribed and data from the transcriptions were analyzed for this study using various coding methods. The voices of these educators shared their trials and frustrations as it relates to undesirable behaviors in the classroom as well as their hope for innovative strategies such as the use of therapy dogs that can aid in mitigating these behaviors. In addition to the information teachers shared regarding behavior and the use of therapy dogs, they also shared excitement about the use of therapy dogs to aid in the academic success of students.

Abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders worldwide. Cognitive therapy (CT) is an evidence-based treatment that primarily helps patients with MDD modify their negative and dysfunctional thinking patterns in order to reduce their depressive symptoms. One important cognitive style in MDD is cognitive vulnerability, or the attributions that people make about the experience of negative life events. The reformulated learned helplessness theory posits that people with a tendency to make global, stable, and internal causal attributions for negative life events are more likely to become depressed (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978). The revised hopelessness theory suggests that, in addition to these three causal attributions, perceived consequences and inferred low self-worth are also key attributions that may lead to developing depression (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989). The present study investigates these two theories of cognitive vulnerability as predictors of acute symptom reductions, dropout, and relapse in CT for depression. Moreover, whether the revised hopelessness theory predicts acute and long-term treatment outcomes above and beyond the older reformulated learned helplessness theory is tested.In this study, 126 patients diagnosed with MDD participated in 16 weeks of CT and cognitive vulnerability was assessed pre- and post-treatment. First, cognitive vulnerability decreased during an acute course of CT and these reductions were associated with concurrent improvements in depressive symptoms. Second, greater pre-treatment cognitive vulnerability emerged as a prognostic indicator of faster depressive symptom reductions during CT. Third, cognitive vulnerability was not predictive of risk of treatment dropout. Finally, a composite measure of the three causal attributions outlined by the reformulated learned helplessness theory predicted relapse during a one-year follow-up period. When testing these two theories, adding the two attributions suggested by the revised hopelessness theory significantly improved the prediction of slopes of symptom change. However, adding these two dimensions did not improve the models predicting dropout or relapse. Overall, this study demonstrates how cognitive vulnerability predicts acute and long-term CT treatment outcomes. Importantly, obtaining a more sophisticated understanding of cognitive vulnerability may have direct implications on intervention and prevention efforts for patients with MDD, with the overall goal of improving cognitive-behavioral treatments and reducing the risk for relapse.

There has been limited research on this topic. This study explores mental health practitioners' views and experiences of addressing causal beliefs in treatment. A thematic framework guided the analysis of semi-structured interviews with 17 mental health practitioners. Participants stated that their causal beliefs impact their approach to treatment, and clients' causal beliefs influence how clients approach treatment. Participants thought that it was important to discuss causes with clients and identified several barriers to, and consequences of, doing so. Participants identified that addressing causal beliefs in treatment influenced factors such as practitioner empathy, therapeutic alliance, engagement in treatment and clients' self-blame.

Abstract = {Background: Prior studies have established inconsistent associations between body weight and mental health. However, most work has relied on body mass index (BMI) and examination of a single mental health variable. The present study examined associations of BMI and waist circumference with multiple mental health variables in a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample. Methods: Nursing staff measured waist circumference and calculated the BMI of 742 adults (54.6% female, 45.4% male) presenting for psychiatric treatment. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS- 24), and Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) as part of standard clinical monitoring. Suicide risk was assessed using the clinician-administered Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.). For curve fit estimation regression models, we entered BMI and waist circumference as independent variables separately; we entered seven dependent variables separately: 1) depression, 2) anxiety, 3) substance use, 4) self-harm, 5) interpersonal functioning, 6) well-being, and 7) suicide risk. Results: Increased BMI was associated with decreased well-being and increased depression. Increased waist circumference was associated with worse interpersonal functioning. Non-linear (quadratic) associations were observed between weight and depression, substance use, self-harm, and suicide. Limitations: Most of the sample was White and only 2.6% was in the underweight category, limiting broad applicability of findings. Cross-sectional design precludes causal attributions. Conclusions: Given associations between well-being, depression, interpersonal functioning, substance use, self-harm, and suicide with weight, findings may be used to inform mental health treatment, particularly by tailoring interventions to high-risk weight categories (underweight, obese) in psychiatric populations.

Abstract = {The current paper reports three experimental studies that investigate how selectively emphasising different treatment approaches (biological, psychological or social) for mental health difficulties affects lay beliefs about those illnesses. Online experimental vignettes exposed participants to different treatment narratives for a clinical case of Major Depressive Disorder (Study 1; n=164), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Study 2; n=173) and Schizophrenia (Study 3, n=170). Measures of causal attributions and illness perceptions assessed effects on beliefs about the causes and course of the illness. Emphasising psychological treatment of Major Depressive Disorder promoted more causal attributions to personal weakness, while endorsing biological treatment weakened confidence in individual control over the course of the illness. For Generalized Anxiety Disorder, stressing social treatment encouraged more causal attributions to personal weakness and lifestyle factors. Causal attributions for Schizophrenia did not shift according to treatment modality, but highlighting biological treatment made the symptoms appear more treatable, while emphasising psychological treatment made the illness seem more personally controllable. As lay understandings of the causes and course of mental illness have implications for help-seeking, treatment engagement and stigma, effects on illness beliefs may be an important consideration when endorsing a particular treatment approach in public discourse or clinical communication.

Abstract = {Background: Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa with children and adolescents constituting more than 40% of the population. Evidence shows the onset of significant degrees of mental illnesses is detectable in this age range. For such early identification to be made there should be a system responding to those needs. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the extent to which the education system is responsive to the psychosocial and mental health needs of children in primary schools through putting appropriate professionals in place, raising teachers' awareness and putting in place viable policies and guidelines. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted in public and private primary schools in Gondar city Data was collected through focus group discussions from seventeen participants drawn from both schools and key informant interviews with two experts from the zonal Department of Education. A thematic qualitative data analysis was employed. Themes were identified with the help of the Nvivo 12 plus software. Results: We found teachers' mental health awareness is very low with parameters such as magnitude, case identification and support. There is an exception in terms of causal attributions of mental illness that matches with scientific literature. Psychosocial support and mental health resources are not available and schools do not provide capacity building mental health trainings for teachers which might help them to identify, handle and make referrals of mental health cases. We also found the Ethiopian education policy and other guidelines do not address the issue of mental health at primary school level. Conclusion: The Ethiopian education system is not responsive to the psychosocial and mental health needs of children in primary schools. Implications: Arresting minor impairments before they become major disabilities is vital. Investing in childhood mental health enables a healthy and productive society to be cultivated. The Ethiopian education system should therefore respond to the psychosocial and mental health needs of children in primary schools.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Abstract = {Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are highly prevalent amongst perinatal women in low-resource settings of South Africa, but there is no access to standardised counselling support for these conditions in public health facilities. The aim of this study is to develop a task-sharing psychological counselling intervention for routine treatment of mild to moderate symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety in South Africa, as part of the Health Systems Strengthening in sub-Saharan Africa (ASSET) study.; Methods: We conducted a review of manuals from seven counselling interventions for depression and anxiety in low- and middle-income countries and two local health system training programmes to gather information on delivery format and common counselling components used across task-sharing interventions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 health workers and 37 pregnant women from four Midwife Obstetric Units in Cape Town to explore perceptions and needs relating to mental health. Stakeholder engagements further informed the intervention design and appropriate service provider. A four-day pilot training with community-based health workers refined the counselling content and training material.; Results: The manual review identified problem-solving, psychoeducation, basic counselling skills and behavioural activation as common counselling components across interventions using a variety of delivery formats. The interviews found that participants mostly identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in behavioural terms, and lay health workers and pregnant women demonstrated their understanding through a range of local idioms. Perceived causes of symptoms related to interpersonal conflict and challenging social circumstances. Stakeholder engagements identified a three-session counselling model as most feasible for delivery as part of existing health care practices and community health workers in ward-based outreach teams as the best placed delivery agents. Pilot training of a three-session intervention with community-based health workers resulted in minor adaptations of the counselling assessment method.; Conclusion: Input from health workers and pregnant women is a critical component of adapting existing maternal mental health protocols to the context of routine care in South Africa, providing valuable data to align therapeutic content with contextual needs. Multisector stakeholder engagements is vital to align the intervention design to health system requirements and guidelines.},

Abstract = {Adolescents who hold an entity theory of personality – the belief that people cannot change – are more likely to report internalizing symptoms during the socially stressful transition to high school. It has been puzzling, however, why a cognitive belief about the potential for change predicts symptoms of an affective disorder. The present research integrated three models – implicit theories, hopelessness theories of depression, and the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat – to shed light on this issue. Study 1 replicated the link between an entity theory and internalizing symptoms by synthesizing multiple datasets (N = 6,910). Study 2 examined potential mechanisms underlying this link using 8-month longitudinal data and 10-day diary reports during the stressful first year of high school (N = 533, 3,199 daily reports). The results showed that an entity theory of personality predicted increases in internalizing symptoms through tendencies to make fixed trait causal attributions about the self and maladaptive (i.e., 'threat') stress appraisals. The findings support an integrative model whereby situation-general beliefs accumulate negative consequences for psychopathology via situation-specific attributions and appraisals.

Abstract = {It is well established that emphasizing a biogenetic etiology of mental health problems in anti-stigma interventions inadvertently increases potentially stigmatizing attitudes. The 'mixed-blessings' model suggests that biogenetic explanations and greater stigma are linked by essentialism. The present study tests this hypothesis experimentally. In this online experiment, 367 subjects read either a biogenetic or a psychosocial explanation for the etiology of schizophrenia, followed by a vignette describing an individual who has schizophrenia. Subsequently, we measured (a) causal beliefs on the etiology of schizophrenia (as a manipulation check), (b) the degree of essentialist beliefs (mediator), (c) the extent to which subjects subscribed to assumptions of dangerousness, (d) prognostic pessimism, and (e) desire for social distance. Subjects reported a stronger agreement with the etiology they had been presented. Against our expectations, this did not result in higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes in the biogenetic vignette group. Correspondingly, mediation through essentialism could not be tested. In the psychosocial vignette group, biogenetic causal beliefs were associated with a stronger desire for social distance. Essentialist thinking fully mediated this effect. The evidence we found for the assumptions of the mixed-blessings extended to the psychosocial vignette group only. We explain this by the subjects’ different readiness to subscribe to biogenetic and psychosocial causal beliefs. We argue that the same levels of essentialism between the experimental groups contributed to the equal levels of stigmatizing attitudes. This underlines the fundamental importance of essentialism in stigma, going beyond a role in the psychological effects of biogenetic causal models.

Participants completed a questionnaire on their views about either schizophrenia (N = 282) or depression (N = 277). The depression group was surer than the schizophrenia group that: the disorder was due to psychosocial causes; curable; non-requiring long-term pharmacotherapy; the persons with depression could participate in religious activities. The older priests were more convinced than the younger priests that: the prayer and long-term pharmacotherapy are useful; the persons with mental disorders had affective difficulties, are recognizable and kept at distance.

Abstract = {While eating disorders were historically considered to be a result of psychological or environmental causes, current evidence suggests that eating disorders are the product of complex gene–environment interactions wherein heritable vulnerabilities are activated by multiple exposures to environmental stimuli over the lifespan. Despite the fact that this integrated biopsychosocial etiological view of eating disorders is accepted among many professionals in the eating disorder field, evidence suggests that the general public and some clinicians are susceptible to dualist, or reductionist, views of psychopathology. Currently, little is known about (a) the prevalence of reductionist biological views of eating disorder etiology in those with eating disorders (this view attributes the cause of eating disorders to predominantly biological factors but does not acknowledge psychosocial factors as important contributors), (b) the effects of reductionist biological views on clinical outcomes, and (c) the most effective methods for modifying these views. In this article, we present the results of a preliminary investigation on the relationship between perceived causes of eating disorders and the attitudes and behaviors of those with eating disorders. We then go on to propose specific avenues for further research on uncovering the effects of reductionist biological views of eating disorder etiology.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by J. M. Bailey (see record [rid]2020-69802-008[/rid]). The idea that something is inherently pathologic about people with sexual minority identities has a long and persistent history. Such theories, including biological and psychoanalytic approaches, have posited that homosexuality and mental illnesses are closely linked (Byne, 2007; Drescher, 2015). Following post-World War II scientific development of stress theory and research on stigma and prejudice more generally, minority stress theory departed from this formulation in arguing that what makes sexual minority people ill are social arrangements (Hobfoll, 1998; Meyer, 2003). Most recently, Bailey (2020) proposed a 'rival' genetic model to explain sexual minority disparities in mental health outcomes. In Fig. 1, accompanying this commentary, the current authors depict Bailey’s proposed model. The fgure shows that a genetic factor is responsible for both same-sex sexual orientation and neuroticism. In turn, neuroticism is related to rejection sensitivity and adverse mental health outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety). Neuroticism, together with these adverse mental health outcomes, is associated with increased reports of exposure to stigma, prejudice, and discrimination. This neatly explains the observation that sexual minorities report excess minority stress and adverse outcomes. In this model, reports of exposure to stigma, prejudice, and discrimination are spurious artifacts of neuroticism rather than accurate reflections of the world. This model is very different than the minority stress model, which has served as a leading model in explaining sexual and gender minority health disparities (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Bailey (2020) restricted his comments to sexual minorities, so the current authors discuss only sexual minorities in this reply, but similar arguments can be made regarding gender minorities. In summary, the current authors have shown that studies using multiple measures and designs extend the evidence for minority stress beyond the associational self-reports of stigma exposure cited by Bailey (2020). They have also shown that the evidence for a genetic model, proposed by Bailey as a rival to the minority stress model, is overly simplistic in its causal attributions and that the research evidence for such a model is weak.

Abstract = {Background: Evidence indicates that mental health issues like depression, epilepsy, and substance misuse can be detected with reasonable accuracy in resource-poor settings. The Community Informant Detection Tool (CIDT) is one such approach used for detecting mental health problems, including depression. We adapted this community informant approach for detecting maternal depression in Pakistan. Methods: Adaptation of Community Informant Detection Tool for Maternal Depression (CIDT-MD) involved five steps. First, a scoping review of the literature was conducted to select an appropriate tool for adaptation. Second, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore the idioms of depression and distress, perceived causes, and the effects of maternal depression among currently depressed and recovered mothers (n = 11), mothers in law (n = 6), and Primary Care Providers (Primary Care Physicians and Lady Health Supervisors) (n = 6). Third, case vignettes and illustrations were created with input from a panel of mental health experts, incorporating the idioms of depression and distress used, causes, and effects for each symptom described. Fourth, to assess the comprehensibility of the illustrations and level of understanding, Focus Group Discussions (n = 4) were done with purposely selected community health workers (Lady Health Workers and Lay Peers, n = 28) trained in delivering maternal depression intervention. The final step was reflection and inputs by a panel of mental health experts on all steps to finalize the content of the tool. Results: Context-specific cultural adaptation in the presentation and format of CIDT-MD was conducted successfully. Lady Health Workers (LHW) and Lay Peers (LP) were found to be the most appropriate persons to use the tool and function as the informants. The adapted tool with all its vignettes and illustrations was found to be easily understandable, comprehensible, and culturally appropriate, meaningful, and contextually relevant by the community health workers and peers working in the relevant settings. They easily relate to and identify potentially depressed such women lining up with the tool. Lastly, the coding of the tool was found easy to follow as well. Conclusion: The Community Informant Detection Tool for Maternal Depression (CIDT-MD) is a culturally acceptable, easy to use, and comprehensible tool for detecting maternal depression in community settings of Pakistan. The community informants found the content and approach highly relevant to the local needs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Context: Diasporic Cameroonians are increasingly leading a transnational life in which family members are sustained through networks of relations and obligations. However, before arriving in Europe, the vast majority of African migrants who take the Mediterranean route are exposed to trauma and hardship. Moreover, the joint occurrence of forced displacement, trauma, and extended separation from families has a significant impact on mental health. Objectives: This study explores the role of culture-specific conceptualizations of family structures and transnationalism in explanatory models of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among male Cameroonian asylum-seekers and undocumented migrants in Europe. Methods: An in-depth study of two samples of Cameroonian migrants with a precarious residency status in Europe was conducted. Focus group discussions and interviews were carried out with asylum seekers in Germany ( n = 8) and undocumented migrants and failed asylum seekers in France ( n = 9). The verbatim transcripts of these interviews served as the data for interpretative phenomenological analyses. Results, Analysis, and Discussion: Family was conceptualized in religious and spiritual terms, and relational spirituality appeared to be a crucial element of family cohesion. Explanatory models of PTSD were mainly based on an intersection of family and spirituality. The disrespect of transgenerational, traditional, and spiritual obligations toward parents and ancestral spirits represented a crucial causal attribution for post-traumatic symptoms. Conclusions: Conceptualizations of post-traumatic stress were based on a collective family and spiritual level instead of an individualized illness-centered perception. The Western psychological and psychiatric perspective on post-traumatic stress might conflict with traditional, religious, and spiritual practices in the context of family conceptualizations of Cameroonian forced migrants with a precarious residency status.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Abstract = {COVID-19 and its countermeasures have negatively impacted the mental health of populations worldwide. The current paper considers whether the rising incidence of psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic may affect lay beliefs about the cause and course of mental illness. Laypeople's causal attributions and expectations regarding the trajectory of mental illness have important implications for societal stigma and therapeutic orientations. Two online experimental studies investigated whether reading about fictional cases of mental illness that were explicitly situated during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with reading about the same cases without any pandemic-related contextualisation, affected attributions and expectations about Generalised Anxiety Disorder (Study 1) and Major Depressive Disorder (Study 2). Study 1 ( n = 137) results showed that highlighting the onset of anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic weakened attributions to biological causes and reduced the anticipated duration of symptoms. However, Study 2 ( n = 129) revealed no effects of COVID-19 contextualisation on beliefs about the cause or course of depression. The research provides preliminary evidence that the increased incidence of mental illness during the pandemic may reshape public beliefs about certain mental illnesses. Given the importance of public understandings for the lived experience of mentally unwell persons in society, further evidence of the range and extent of the pandemic's effects on lay beliefs is important to inform clinical, public health and stigma-reduction initiatives.},

Abstract = {Literature shows that mental healthcare workers in Ghana face incessant fear of patient violence that compromise safe care delivery. However, the nature, scale, perceived causes, and consequences of these assaults and how they shape risk perceptions have received limited empirical attention, hence the need for this study. The study employed sequential explanatory mixed methods where questionnaire administration preceded and informed the design of an interview guide used for in‐depth interviews with health workers in referral psychiatric hospitals. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze the quantitative data. Qualitative data were transcribed and analyzed thematically. Findings showed that physical and non‐physical violent assaults and risk perceptions of the hospitals were statistically and significantly associated with females (P < 0.01), nurses (P < 0.01), other clinical cadre (P < 0.01), and those with low job tenure (P < 0.05). About 57% and 71% of the sample reported experiencing physical and non‐physical assaults, respectively. Major and minor injuries and psychosocial problems were frequent sequelae following physical violent assaults. As a result, 80% of the participants perceived the hospitals environment to be unsafe to provide care. Violent assaults compromises safety and care delivery efforts suggesting the need for systematic interventions to minimize mental healthcare workers exposure to patient violence.

Abstract = {Background: There is increased interest in early intervention and prevention of mental health difficulties during adolescence; thus, we are seeing increased efforts to optimize well-being during this epoch. Positive emotional experiences are a central component of overall well-being. However, research exploring what adolescents perceive to be the cause(s) of their emotional difficulties is lacking. Improving understanding of this issue within non-clinical adolescent groups may provide useful insight into how to develop strategies to support young people as they navigate emotional difficulties. Objectives: The aim of this research was to explore if meaningful categories of perceived cause(s) for emotional distress exist for non-clinical adolescent groups. Methods: The data for this study were drawn from interviews across 6 sites in England conducted as part of the 5-year national evaluation of the HeadStart Learning Programme. The sample comprised of 32 young people aged 11-12 years from the first annual wave of qualitative data collection in 2017. Ideal type analysis-a qualitative form of person-centered analysis-was used to construct a typology of adolescents perceived cause(s) for emotional distress. Findings: We identified five distinct categories of perceived cause: (1) perceived lack of control ; (2) unfair treatment ; (3) others, their actions and judgements as the catalyst ; (4) concerns for self and others; and , (5) self as cause . Conclusions: Our findings illustrate that distinct categories for perceived cause of emotional distress exist among adolescents considered to be "at risk" of developing mental health difficulties, which provides a foundation for future necessary work seeking to investigate the possible link between perceived cause for emotional distress and help-seeking behavior among sub-clinical groups.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Abstract = {Raising a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can often be a difficult and stressful process for families and caregivers. Though research on ASDs in Africa is burgeoning, very little is known about autism in francophone West Africa. Furthermore, no known ASD studies have explored parental experiences in particular from a cross-cultural perspective. This research used Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to analyze in-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven Senegalese and seven American families to investigate parental experiences within the Senegalese community with further illustration by cross-cultural comparison. Comparative analysis of data across the two countries was undertaken to identify cultural variables previously unreported, especially those that may affect Senegalese family experience. Analysis of interviews revealed thematic differences in social and community support. Although access to effective treatment services was low among Senegalese families compared to the American families, traditional Senegalese household structures and community relations were hypothesized to serve as protective factors against the high social isolation and resulting logistical struggles reported in the U.S. sample. Further targeted research within the Senegalese environment is recommended, particularly to explore social stigma and its possible effects on families with autism, causal beliefs and treatment practices, and parental mental health and wellbeing.},

Thematic analysis was carried out to identify themes from the serious incident reports for patients between 1 January 2017 and 31 July 2018. Results: In total, 48 cases were reviewed. Three main themes emerged from this study: patient-, professional- and organisation-related factors. The majority of the deaths were caused by patient-related factors, particularly exacerbation of the patient’s mental health condition. Clinical implications: This study provides insight into perceived causes of death by suicide among mental health patients. It is hoped that this will, in turn, influence the manner in which decisions, policies and resource allocation are carried out to further prevent and reduce the incidence of suicide, particularly among mental health patients.

However, it is not yet known whether parental attributions are systematically associated with children’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms and behavior or psychosocial treatment engagement and outcomes across diagnostic categories. This systematic review aimed to fill this knowledge gap using a transdiagnostic perspective to synthesize the literature on the associations between parent–causal and child-responsible attributions and children’s internalizing and externalizing behavior, treatment engagement, and treatment outcomes for parents and children. A total of 67 studies were identified. Overall, biased child-responsible attributions were associated with elevated child internalizing and externalizing symptoms and behavior across diagnoses, while findings on the association between parent-causal attributions and child behavior were inconsistent. The link between parental attributions and treatment engagement was also mixed, varying across treatment type, child diagnosis, and focus of attributions. Regarding treatment outcomes, less biased parent-causal and child-responsible attributions were linked to post-treatment improvements in children’s behaviors, while mixed findings were reported on post-treatment improvements in parental attributions. Findings are discussed with a focus on approaches to enhance the effectiveness of assessment and psychosocial treatment approaches across diagnostic categories with consideration of parental attributions.

Abstract = {Background: Illness beliefs are significant contributors to health outcomes. Beliefs about the cause of physical symptoms are considered particularly important among those with medically unexplained symptoms and illnesses (MUS); yet little is known about causal beliefs among those with the most severe MUS (i.e., Veterans). The goal of the current study was to examine Veteran's causal attributions of their physical symptoms. Method: A total of 91 combat Veterans with MUS were surveyed using a mixed-methods design about the cause of their physical symptoms, physical symptom severity, and PTSD symptoms. Causal attributions of physical symptoms were analyzed through thematic response analysis and grouped into categories. Chi-square analysis was used to assess the distribution of causal attribution types across Veterans with varying physical symptom severity and PTSD symptom severity. Results: Veterans with MUS reported an average of 7.9 physical symptoms, and attributed the cause of their symptoms to seven different categories ('Do not Know,' 'Stress/Mental Health,' 'Deployment/Environment,' 'Functional/Symptom,' 'Medically Explained,' 'Medically Unexplained Syndrome,' and 'Lifestyle'). Exploratory chi-square analysis revealed significant differences in causal attributions across physical symptom severity and severity of PTSD symptoms. Veterans with more severe PTSD and Veterans with more severe physical symptoms were more likely to attribute their MUS to stress/mental health or to a medically unexplained syndrome compared with those with low/no PTSD symptoms and physical symptom severity. Veterans with minimal PTSD and Veterans with minimal physical symptom severity were more likely to attribute the cause of their MUS to lifestyle choices (e.g., exercise/diet) compared with those with high PTSD and physical symptom severity. Conclusion: Veterans with MUS endorse multiple, varied causal attributions for their physical symptoms, suggesting more complex causal beliefs than typically assumed. This has important implications for patient-provider communication and development of concordance around MUS treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objectives: To understand how patients and family members experience dehumanizing or humanizing treatment when in the ICU.; Design: Qualitative study included web-based focus groups and open-ended surveys posted to ICU patient/family social media boards. Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed. Social media responses were collected and organized by stakeholder group. Data underwent qualitative analysis.; Setting: Remote focus groups and online surveys.; Patients: ICU patient survivors, family members, and ICU teams.; Interventions: Not available.; Measurements and Main Results: Semi-structured questions and open-ended survey responses. We enrolled 40 patients/family members and 31 ICU team members. Focus groups and surveys revealed three primary themes orienting humanizing/dehumanizing ICU experiences: 1) communication, 2) outcomes, and 3) causes of dehumanization. Dehumanization occurred during "communication" exchanges when ICU team members talked "over" patients, made distressing remarks when patients were present, or failed to inform patients about ICU-related care. "Outcomes" of dehumanization were associated with patient loss of trust in the medical team, loss of motivation to participate in ICU recovery, feeling of distress, guilt, depression, and anxiety. Humanizing behaviors were associated with improved recovery, well-being, and trust. "Perceived causes" of dehumanizing behaviors were linked to patient, ICU team, and healthcare system factors.; Conclusions: Behaviors of ICU clinicians may cause patients and families to feel dehumanized when in the ICU. Negative behaviors are noticed by patients and families, possibly contributing to poor outcomes including mental health, recovery, and lack of trust in ICU teams. Supporting ICU clinicians may enable a more empathic environment and in turn more humanizing clinician-patient encounters.; Competing Interests: The authors have disclosed that they do not have any potential conflicts of interest.

Abstract = {There is empirical evidence to suggest that problematic smartphone use (PSU) is associated with mental health problems including anxiety in educational settings. This qualitative study explored attitudes towards—and self-reported impacts of—smartphone use among British young adult students, as well as perceived causes of PSU. Free-response written accounts were gathered from 265 British undergraduates at an English university. Open-ended questions were asked about their attitudes towards smartphone use, their reasons for using their smartphones, and what they perceived as the consequences of their smartphone use. Narratives were analyzed using framework analysis and a thematic framework was identified. The three main consequences of PSU described by participants were (1) uncontrolled frequent checking of smartphones, (2) using smartphones late at night, and irrelevant use of smartphones in class. The main reported explanations for PSU were fear of missing messages, boredom in class, poor self-regulation, and external reasons (e.g., boring lectures). Smartphone use was reported to have both positive and negative impacts on young adults’ life satisfaction, social relationships, physical health, and study. Many participants reported that they need to develop better self-regulation to address their PSU. Findings suggest that smartphone use can have benefits as well as potentially causing harm among university students. PSU can—in some cases—be understood as reflecting mental well-being issues, poor self-regulation, and social problems. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: The mental health system in Indonesia comprises attempts to modernise a colonial relic. There is still a disconnect between available services and help-seeking behaviours at the grassroots level. This study aims to explore the perceptions of Javanese people on the aetiology of mental illness and their ideas on how to deal with individuals who may have mental illness.; Methods: This qualitative study involves semi-structured interviews, embedded in a cluster randomised trial examining the clinical and cost-effectiveness of primary mental health services. Interviews were conducted with Indonesian and Javanese. The recruitment procedure was aligned to the trial. Participants were primary care patients recruited from 21 sites across Yogyakarta province. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview transcripts.; Results: 75 participants took part in the study: 51 women (68%) and 24 men (32%). Key themes emerged around perceived causes of mental health problems (including 'extrinsic factors'; 'intrinsic factors'; and 'spiritual factors'), and perceived appropriate pathways of care ('modern medical science'; 'social support and activities'; and 'religious or spiritual interventions'). Gender potentially influenced some of the responses.; Conclusions: Themes indicate the variety of preconceptions towards mental health problems and assumptions regarding the best management pathways. Some of these preconceptions and assumptions support the utility of modern medical care, while the rest promote spiritual or religious healers. Participants' ideas of the appropriate care pathways largely correspond to their perception of what the symptoms are caused by. Despite hints to some understanding of the bio-psycho-social model of mental illness, most participants did not capture the complexity of mental health and illness, indicating the importance of contextual (especially culturally and religiously-aligned) public education around mental health, illness and care.

Abstract = {Objective: The beliefs that people with psychosis hold about causes of their illness (causal beliefs) can affect their choice to adhere to treatment and engage in mental health services. However, less is known about causal beliefs of mental health professionals (MHPs) and their impact on treatment adherence and service engagement. This review explored literature focusing on MHPs’ causal beliefs and mapped the degree of concordance between their causal beliefs and those of people with psychosis. Methods: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Applied Social Sciences Index Abstracts and a gray-literature search of PsyArXiv and MedNar yielded 11,821 eligible references. The first author reviewed all titles and abstracts, and the coauthors reviewed 10% (N51,200). Results: Forty-two articles were included. Most articles indicated that MHPs tend to endorse biogenetic beliefs (9 of 15 articles assessing MHPs’ beliefs, 60%), whereas people with psychosis tend to endorse psychosocial beliefs (16 of 31 articles, 52%) and other nonbiogenetic beliefs (in 8 of 31 articles, 26%). Most studies did not compare causal beliefs of people with psychosis and their treating MHP. Studies varied in design, setting, and measures. Conclusions: MHPs and people with psychosis often hold complex views composed of different types of causal beliefs. However, a gap in causal beliefs between these groups appears to exist, which may affect the therapeutic relationship and pose barriers to treatment adherence. Future studies should address this gap by developing interventions that facilitate open communication about causal beliefs to promote treatment alliance and shared decision making.

Abstract = {Objectives: The current study investigated beliefs about psychologists, psychological services and obesity, and their association with intentions to see a psychologist for weight management. Methods: A cross‐sectional online survey design was employed in a sample of 136 adults with overweight or obesity (n = 121 females, Mage = 37.58, SD = 9.85). Results: Psychologists and psychological services were viewed favourably by participants, with little evidence of role knowledge deficits or significant treatment barriers. Behavioural and social causal beliefs about obesity were indirectly associated with intentions to see a psychologist for weight management through positive associations with psychologists' perceived helpfulness in lifestyle intervention. Indirect effects were not observed for psychological and medical causal beliefs. Conclusion: Promotion of psychological services in obesity could highlight their utility in addressing behavioural and social factors. However, there is a need for more research into avoidance of all sources of professional support in this context. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Epidemiological studies show that even in highly developed countries many people with depression do not seek help for their mental health issues, despite promising prevention approaches encouraging people to seek help and reduce self-stigma. Therefore, an anti-stigma intervention study to support help-seeking behaviour will be developed on the basis of the newly explicated "Seeking Mental Health Care Model".; Methods: A quasi-experimental online study will be carried out to assess the effect of different intervention variables relevant for the help-seeking process. The study is conceived as a fractional factorial design. Participants will be screened for depressive complaints (PHQ-9 sum score ≥ 8) and current psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment. After baseline assessment the participants will be randomly allocated into one of the 24 study groups receiving different combinations of the vignette-based intervention aiming to reduce stigma and support help-seeking. Next, relevant outcome measures will be administered a second time. In a 3- and 6-month follow-up help-seeking behaviour will be measured. Gamified elements and avatar-choice techniques will be used to heighten study immersion and adherence.; Discussion: On the basis of the project results, promising research and intervention perspectives can be developed. Results, firstly, allow for a more detailed empirical investigation and conceptualisation of the stages of mental health care utilisation, as well as an examination of theoretical approaches to stigmatisation. Secondly, our online study could provide insights for an evidence-based design and evaluation of online interventions for people with a mental illness.; Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00023557 .

Abstract = {Background: Socio-culturally determined processes account for how individuals give meanings to health, illness, causal attributions, expectations from treatment, and related outcomes. There is limited evidence of explanatory models for mental distress among higher education institutions in Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to explore the explanatory models for mental distress among Wolaita Sodo University.; Methods: The current study used a phenomenological research approach, and we collected data from 21 students. The participants were purposively recruited based on eligibility criteria. Semi-structured interviews were conducted from December 2017 to January 2018 using the Short Explanatory Models Interview. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed into the Amharic language and translated into English. Data were analyzed using framework analysis with the assistance of open code software 4.02.; Results: Most students experienced symptoms of being anxious, fatigue, headaches and feelings of hopelessness. They labeled these symptoms like anxiety or stress. The most commonly reported causal explanations were psychosocial factors. Students perceived that their anxiety or stress was severe that mainly affected their mind, which in turn impacted their interactions with others, academic result, emotions and motivation to study. Almost all the students received care from informal sources, although they wanted to receive care from mental health professionals. They managed their mental distress using positive as well as negative coping strategies.; Conclusion: The policy implication of our findings is that mental health interventions in higher education institutions in Ethiopia should take into account the explanatory models of students' psychological distress.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that they have no competing interests in this work.

Abstract = {The saying "mental illness is like any other illness" has increasingly become pervasive in promoting mental health literacy among the public in China. This discourse is based on the fact that mental illness is attributed to primarily biogenetic causes. This study comprises an investigation of the impact of causal attributions of mental illness on the social withdrawal inclination of people with chronic mental illnesses (PCMIs) in China. Drawing on attribution theory and a sample of PCMIs, the current authors further question the effectiveness of biogenetic discourse to combat social stigma and to integrate PCMIs into society. In addition, in response to the proliferation of discussion on the digital inclusion of those with mental disabilities, this study constructs a structural model in which the varied effects of supportive communication are used as bridging factors, including face-to-face, telephonic and social media communication. The results indicate a stronger social withdrawal inclination when the PCMIs attributed their illnesses to biogenetic causes. In addition, biogenetic attribution was also found to potentially hinder the PCMIs from using the telephone and social media to seek supportive communication, while psychosocial attribution was found to have potential to combat PCMIs' social withdrawal inclination. In this vein, this study calls for further investigation on the conditional factors upon which digital inclusion might work for PCMIs in China.},

Abstract = {Background: Lay attitudes are often seen as potential barriers to mental health recovery. But apart from perceiving them as potential barriers, they can also play an important role in stimulating individuals to consult (in)formal help sources, in particular through the process of help referral. Where existing research mainly focusses on actual help seeking behaviour, this study will focus on lay publics’ referral behaviour. Aims: This study analyses the relation between causal beliefs and stigmatising attitudes and social distance on the one hand, and (in)formal help seeking recommendations on the other. Methods: Data from a survey carried out in 2019, assessing the attitudes of Public Health Insurance Provider (HIP) members towards mental health problems, was used. Part of the survey questions was based on a quantitative quasi-experimental design, using hypothetical written vignettes. The weighted data represent a sample of the adult Flemish population (22–94 years, N = 5675). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the relation between causal beliefs and stigma, while binominal logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relation between causal beliefs and help seeking recommendations. Results: The results reveal that causal beliefs significantly associate with stigma, measured by stigmatising attitudes and social distance: personal- or biogenetic beliefs associate with more stigma, where psychosocial beliefs associate with less stigma. Concerning help seeking recommendations, psychosocial beliefs associate with recommending psychological or psychotherapeutic care, biogenetic beliefs associate with advising help from general practitioners and suggesting psychiatric help, while personal beliefs negatively associate with recommending formal help. Meanwhile, biogenetic beliefs associate with less informal help seeking recommendations (e.g. family, friends and online self-help), where personal beliefs associate with more informal help seeking recommendations and psychosocial beliefs only associate with online help referral. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of causal beliefs in affecting public stigma and help seeking recommendations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Most research evaluating eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy has taken place in community settings, leaving the impact for service users within inpatient environments less clear. This systematic review sought to identify, summarize, and critically evaluate studies that investigated the impact of EMDR on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within adult inpatient mental health settings. Seven databases were systematically searched to identify published and unpublished articles eligible for inclusion. Eleven studies, published between 1995 and 2020, were included within this review. All studies showed that EMDR improved PTSD symptoms, across a variety of study populations. However, these findings are limited by the (a) preponderance of case study designs (preventing causal attribution); (b) provision of synchronous treatments; (c) poor methodological quality; and (d) high heterogeneity across studies. Prior research has shown EMDR’s effectiveness and safety for vulnerable populations. While the evidence is beginning to support its use with those experiencing PTSD symptoms within adult inpatient settings, it is premature to strongly recommend it as a routine intervention. Future research within this area is recommended. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study explored a group of Canadian elementary educators' and their mental health literacy (recognition, help-seeking, attitudes), their social-emotional learning beliefs (comfort, commitment, culture), and their causal attributions and cognitive and affective responses to externalizing and internalizing mental health challenges, to understand decision-making. A mixed method design with two consecutive phases, quantitative (online survey) and qualitative (vignette think-aloud task, semi-structured interview), allowed for an exploration of educators with high and low mental health literacy levels, using descriptive, inferential, and constant comparison analyses. It was found that educators possessed mixed levels of recognition accuracy, and that these were relatively higher than educators' help-seeking confidence across both phases. In particular, externalizing (i.e., ODD) and internalizing (i.e., OCD) disorders were more recognizable, over specific internalizing ones (i.e., social phobia, depression). High mental health literacy educators expressed higher knowledge of help-seeking strategies, employed tiered-based interventions, and demonstrated higher confidence and self-efficacy in comparison to low mental health literacy educators. Further, educators' sense of comfort in implementing these was positively associated with their mental health literacy scores. In turn, educators' personal experience with someone with mental health problems or disorders was found to be correlated with their comfort in implementing social-emotional learning programs. Educators showed that they had sympathetic attitudes towards children with mental health challenges, but they also recollected more incidents that were characterized by student aggression directed both towards students, and towards teachers, themselves. In terms of causal attributions, educators attributed internalizing challenges towards children; in contrast, they attributed externalizing challenges to families. Finally, educators also showed more cognitive and emotional responsiveness towards externalizing behaviours but were more concerned about internalizing challenges. Together, these findings are interpreted to mean that there is an implicit level of bias within educators' emotions and decision-making about children with mental health challenges. Implications from these findings include increasing support for educators' mental health literacy in terms of recognition of internalizing challenges, help-seeking knowledge, and providing opportunities for the exploration of emotions and reactions during interactions with children with mental health challenges, especially externalizing ones.

Abstract = {The thesis sought to explore cultural differences of causal beliefs for psychosis in South Asian populations. It is comprised of three standalone papers. Paper one and two have been prepared for submission to a journal and in accordance with the journal guidelines.Paper one is a systematic literature review synthesising studies relating to causal beliefs that people from South Asian populations give for psychosis. Databases were systematically searched and 17 studies were included in the review. Some core themes emerged from the studies. The majority of South Asians gave supernatural and spiritual beliefs for psychosis and reportedly prefer more traditional and non-biomedical treatment options.Paper two is a quantitative study which investigated cultural difference in causal explanations for psychosis in South Asian and White British young people. There were 206 participants that completed the questionnaire packs, of these 128 were included in the final analysis. The clinical implications of the findings are discussed with reference to existing literaturePaper three is a critical review of the research process, focusing on the experience of undertaking the research project including personal reflections of the process, as well as the implications of the research for future research needs.

Abstract = {Evidence supports Allport's (1954) contention that social contact reduces mental illness stigma and promotes symptom recognition. However, an important limitation of existing research is that it typically relies on relatively simplistic measures of contact (e.g., any contact, number of contacts). Here, we build on prior work by examining how contact with persons with mental illness within social networks shapes labeling processes and beliefs about the causes of mental illness. Using egocentric network methods and vignette data from the 2018 General Social Survey (N = 1173), findings reveal that connections to valued ties (e.g., friends, family) that disconfirm commonly held stereotypes about people with mental illness contribute to improved recognition of mental illness and reduce the likelihood of endorsing stigmatizing beliefs about causes of mental illness. By using network theory and methods, this research extends current understanding of the role of contact by revealing not only whether contact matters, but how it matters and under what circumstances it may reduce prejudice and discrimination attached to mental illness in contemporary society.

Abstract = {Public stigma is one of barriers for help-seeking of people with depression, which can be predicted by psychosocial causal beliefs. The present study aimed to explore how psychosocial causal beliefs, stereotypes, and emotional reactions could affect professional help-seeking preferences. A representative community-based sample of Taiwanese adults aged 20–65 (n = 800) was recruited by a random-digit-dialing computer-assisted telephone interviewing system. Participants were asked to describe their psychosocial causal beliefs, stereotypes, emotional reactions, and professional help-seeking preferences for a person with depression described in a case vignette. Serial mediation analyses were conducted to test the direct and indirect effects of psychosocial causal beliefs on professional help-seeking preferences. Psychosocial causal beliefs were positively associated with perceived dependency, which resulted in stronger pity and, in turn, increased help-seeking preferences for mental health professionals. Psychosocial causal beliefs were positively associated with perceived dependency, which resulted in stronger fear and, in turn, increased help-seeking preferences for other medical professionals (i.e., general practitioner, and Chinese medical doctor). This study indicated that reducing negative emotions such as fear and increasing pity were likely to be useful in promoting public preferences to seek help from mental health professionals. Understanding the complex associations between causal beliefs, stereotypes, emotional reactions, and help-seeking preferences might enable further work in designing evidence-based interventions for depression.

Abstract = {Background: Essentialist theory (ET) links biological attributions for mental illnesses to pessimistic prognostic beliefs and stigma. The commonsense model (CSM) provides a nuanced framework for studying illness beliefs as shaped by experience.; Aims: ET-informed hypotheses linking causal and prognostic beliefs and stigmatizing attitudes concerning depression were tested using CSM constructs with a focus on the moderating effects of self-reported experience with this disorder.; Methods: U.S. adults ( N = 319) completed online questionnaires assessing depression-related beliefs, attitudes and experience. Multiple regression analysis focused on predictive effects of neurobiological and genetic attributions. Potential mediators (prognosis) and moderators (experience) of the biological attribution-stigma link also were tested.; Results: Neurobiological attributions predicted viewing depression as more consequential, longer lasting, and unexpectedly, more treatable. Neurobiological attributions were inversely related to stigma, a link partially mediated by beliefs about depression's consequences and duration. However, both biological attributions' relationships to stigma were moderated by experience. Stronger biological attributions predicted less stigma specifically among participants reporting first- or second-hand experience with depression.; Conclusion: Experience with depression may shape the relationships of specific causal and prognostic beliefs with depression stigma. Psychoeducation in clinical and public health contexts may be informed by further research using CSM constructs.},

Abstract = {Background and Aims: The purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes toward eating disorders in native German adolescents (Germans), adolescents with Turkish migration background in Germany (Immigrants), and native Turkish adolescents (Turks).; Method: A total of 507 adolescents ( N  = 139 Germans; N  = 126 Immigrants; N  = 242 Turks) read a vignette describing a 16-year-old female with bulimic symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires on mental health literacy, stigmatization, desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors and acquaintance with bulimic symptoms.; Results: Adolescents living in Germany were more likely to recognize the vignette as an eating disorder than Turks. Immigrants were more similar to Germans in mental health literacy of eating disorders than Turks. However, in terms of stigmatizing attitudes, immigrants blamed more than Germans, Turks being intermediate on this variable. In Turks, higher desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors was associated with an increased acquaintance with bulimic symptoms and decreased evaluations of impairment. Higher mental health literacy was associated with less blame in Germans.; Conclusions: Migration background was associated with increased mental health literacy of eating disorders but did not result in reduced stigma. Differences in attitudes toward eating disorders indicate the need for differential interventions across the groups.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Nearly 1 million children visit emergency departments (EDs) annually for mental health crises. Caregivers play a critical role in the outcome of mental illness in their children, yet there is limited research on effective means to engage caregivers in the ED and provide the support they need. Our aim was to determine caregivers' perceptions about mental illness in their children, specifically regarding suicidality and depression, the impact of the children's mental health on the caregiver, and barriers to and facilitators of treatment.; Methods: Guided by qualitative descriptive methodology, we conducted semistructured, open-ended interviews with a purposive sample of English-speaking primary caregivers of children 6 to 17 years old who presented with suicidal ideations or behaviors to 1 urban pediatric ED. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and conventional content analysis was performed.; Results: The participants (n = 20) were largely single ethnic-racial minority mothers. Content analysis identified 6 categories: caregivers' definitions of mental health, depression, and suicidality; perceived causes of mental illness; difficulty in identification of mental illness; the influence of the mental illness on caregivers; a complex network of communication among involved parties that resulted in the child's ED visit, as well as barriers to and facilitators of treatment.; Conclusions: We identified several categories that encapsulate caregivers' perceptions of mental health and mental illness in their children and its effect on them. Future research should explore how inner-city EDs might partner with schools and trusted community-based organizations to enhance caregiver knowledge, reduce obstacles to care, increase screening for at-risk youth and implement strategies to optimize outcomes for children with depression and suicidal ideations.; Competing Interests: Disclosure: The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Abstract = {Rural Indigenous communities in Alaska suffer staggeringly high rates of suicide. In close-knit Alaska Native villages, each suicide leaves a trail of affected family and community members in its wake. This research aimed to understand community perceptions of what causes suicide in rural Alaska Native villages and generate recommendations for prevention strategies. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 Alaska Native university students who moved from rural villages to an urban area to attend college. All had been profoundly affected by others' suicides and shared their beliefs about causal factors and recommendations for prevention efforts. Perceived causes included resistance to seeking help or discussing personal problems, loss of culture, traumatic experiences, geographical and social isolation, lack of opportunity, substance abuse, and exposure to others' suicides. Participants believed that suicide is preventable and recommended multi-level approaches to address suicide disparities. They provided recommendations for potentially effective and culturally appropriate prevention strategies, including increasing cultural and social connections, educating community members about mental health, and increasing accessibility of counseling services/reducing barriers to mental health services utilization.},

Abstract = {Background: Interactions with clients have been identified as a key potential stressor within veterinary practice. However, there is a lack of research investigating the experience, and impact, of specific behaviours, such as incivility. The current study aimed to address this literature gap by investigating veterinarian perceptions of client rudeness.; Method: Telephone interviews (n = 18) were used to gather qualitative data regarding veterinarian perceptions of client rudeness. This encompassed description of an uncivil interaction, potential causes of incivility, the impact on the veterinarian and coping strategies.; Results: The results indicate that veterinarians are exposed to a range of rude behaviours from clients, with suggested causal attributions spanning financial concerns, stress and worry. Adverse consequences associated with uncivil interactions included increased stress, mental health impacts and withdrawal from clients. Responses to incivility encompassed proactive pre-planning, empathy and clear communication. Support from colleagues was important to enable reflection and coping, alongside individual strategies, such as self-care.; Conclusion: Client incivility has the potential to adversely impact veterinarians. Appraisal of potential external causes for rudeness could facilitate constructive responses to client incivility and support coping. This should be combined with emotional support from colleagues to mitigate any negative consequences following uncivil client interactions. (© 2021 British Veterinary Association.)},

Abstract = {Background: Mental health is a critical component of healthy aging. Aging increases the likelihood of developing chronic diseases. The negative effects of chronic diseases on mental health have been extensively documented. Physical activity and social support have been reported to influence mental health positively. Methods: Data analyzed are drawn from the national Canadian Community Health Survey—Mental Health in 2012. Structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques were used to estimate and test the mediating role of physical activities and social support in the relationship between chronic disease, positive mental health, and psychological distress in a national adult population sample aged 65+. Results: Approximately 83% of the older adults sample reported having at least one chronic disease, and the mean score of psychological distress and positive mental health was 14.15 ± 4.73 and 55.28 ± 10.67, respectively. Initial analysis found that chronic illness was negatively related to positive mental health (β= -0.72, P < 0.001) and positively related to psychological distress (β=0.98, P < 0.001). The final structural model found that physical activity and social support partially mediated the negative consequences of chronic disease on psychological distress and strengthened seniors’ positive mental health. Limitations: Limiting causal attribution, potential reporting bias and limited in recognizing negative and positive social support are the major limitations. Conclusions: Older adults with chronic diseases should be encouraged to increase physical activity and social support levels. The study outcomes have clinical implications for the delivery of mental health services to improve mental health and resilience to coping with stress among older adults.

Abstract = {Background:  Oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT) syndrome is one of the causes of male infertility, characterized by a decreased number of sperms (oligospermia), poor sperm motility (asthenospermia), and abnormal sperm shape (teratospermia). In necrospermia, spermatozoa in the ejaculated semen are dead, and in hypospermia, semen volume is less than 2 mL. The present case may be unique because of the association of all these features together in a single patient.; Method:  This idiopathic case was treated, from November 2016 to April 2017 in the National Homeopathy Research Institute in Mental Health, with the homeopathic medicine Natrium muriaticum . The Modified Naranjo Criteria for Homeopathy (MONARCH) score was used to assess the likelihood of causal attribution of the clinical outcome to the homeopathic medicine.; Result:  By the third month of starting homeopathic treatment, there was a marked improvement in sperm count from 14.4 to 77.4 million, semen volume from 0.8 to 2.2 mL, and normal forms from 14 to 75%. His wife became pregnant by the 5 th month and delivered a healthy baby girl at full term. A MONARCH score of +9/13 indicates a positive causal relationship between the medicine prescribed and the treatment outcome.; Conclusion:  The present case report suggests a positive effect of individualized homeopathic medicine in treating a rare presentation of male infertility due to OAT syndrome.; Competing Interests: None declared.

Abstract = {Theories on the cause of mental and emotional distress contribute to illness course and treatment. The theorizing of women's experience "as problem" has been widely critiqued by feminist psychologists yet continues in clinical practice. This qualitative study reports on data collected in a psychiatric outpatient clinic in south/central Mexico on the culturally embedded causal theories of mental illness among Mexican patients, a family member or caregiver, and their psychiatrists. The author reports on the influence of gender expectations and the view of "women as problem" in Mexico. Specifically, stakeholders considered that the idea of " mujeres abnegadas " (self-sacrificing women) was the cause of illness in female patients diagnosed with depressive or anxiety-related disorders. In the face of gendered violence and abuse, Mexican women were expected to be silent and submissive, to suppress their thoughts and feelings, and to endure (" aguantar ") their experiences to conform to gender-based expectations, and psychiatrists expressed little hope of alleviating women's suffering. The author discusses her findings in the context of broader sociocultural factors and globalizing forces in psychological theory and practice and provides future directions to help de-pathologize patients' distress, broaden awareness of the contextual forces that influence distress, and galvanize appropriate resources and support.},

To reduce the burden in psychiatric hospitals, Government has decentralized mental health services. Although Government has provided mental health services, the utilization has always been low due to many reasons. In the present study, an attempt was made to assess the accessibility and the barriers to utilizing mental health services with various community stakeholders.; Materials and Methods: This is a qualitative study wherein data was collected from youth, women, geriatric groups, community key leaders, and Anganwadi workers. The primary data were collected through focused group discussions and interview methods. The collected data were analyzed using thematic coding.; Results: A total of twenty-five factors have been identified in the study, which were categorized under eight themes. (a) Lack of awareness and misinformation on mental health, illness, and available services, (b) Perceived causes for mental illness, (c) Reasons for not approaching health professionals, (d) Treatment adherence-related issues, (e) No multidisciplinary team in private hospitals and lack of involvement in government sector (f) Manpower issues, (g) Quality of service issues and building confidence among community people, and (h) Belief system and stigma.; Conclusions: Inadequate mental health services, lack of awareness of mental health, and illness are still persist. The District Mental Health Program and other service providers need to reach communities, especially in remote areas. Periodical evaluation should be carried out to improve the utilization of mental health services.; Competing Interests: There are no conflicts of interest.

Abstract = {Background: Perinatal mental health (PMH) is a worldwide public health issue crossing cultural boundaries. However, the prevalence of PMH conditions vary considerably. These disparities stem in part from poor understanding and stigma surrounding PMH which hinder pregnant women from seeking mental health care and may exacerbate their conditions. Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are South Asian countries with a higher burden of PMH conditions than in the Global North-West and very different social and cultural norms around gender and mental health. The aim of this systematic review (PROSPERO Ref: CRD42020167903) was to identify, synthesise and appraise the available literature on perceptions and attitudes of perinatal (pregnant and postpartum) women, their families and healthcare providers surrounding PMH in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.; Methods: Five electronic databases, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of science, and grey literature were searched using predefined search terms. Qualitative or quantitative articles with a qualitative component reporting perceptions and attitudes surrounding PMH in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan were eligible for inclusion, if published in English between January 2000 and January 2021. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Research Checklist and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional studies were used to assess study quality. Findings were synthesised using thematic synthesis, as described by Thomas and Harden 2008.; Results: Eight studies were included. Five overarching themes comprising 17 sub-categories were identified. These descriptive themes were: perceived causes of PMH, perceived symptoms of PMH, perceptions of motherhood, accessing PMH care and emotional sharing and coping strategies. Sociocultural expectations underpin many of the themes identified in this review including the importance of familial and societal causes of PMH, emphasis on physical symptoms, sacredness of motherhood, lack of awareness, stigma, shame, limited resources allocated for mental health and lack of emotional sharing.; Conclusions: There is a complex range of perceptions and attitudes around PMH which influence women's experiences and access to PMH care. These findings will inform policy and practice through targeted interventions to tackle stigmatising attitudes and increasing education and training for healthcare providers. (© 2022.

Abstract = {This article explores the prevalence of stigma toward mental illness and substance use disorders in faith communities and highlights the roles of familiarity and causal attributions as explanatory factors. Social support within faith communities has been noted as an important mental health resource and faith leaders often represent the first point of contact in a mental health or substance abuse crisis. Yet, faith communities can also perpetuate stigmatization. Based on a vignette-based survey of congregants (N = 1,796) in a diverse set of faith communities in the U.S., this study examines desired social distance as a proxy of stigma toward mental illness (depression and schizophrenia vignettes) and substance use disorders (alcohol and drug use disorder vignettes). Analyses show that survey respondents’ stigmatizing attitudes toward persons with mental health and substance use conditions in faith communities vary strongly by the type of condition. Familiarity with depression is associated with less stigma toward the disorder, but familiarity with the other conditions is not a significant predictor of stigma in the other vignettes. Levels of agreement with biogenetic and psychosocial causal attributions are high, but important associations of personal/moral and spiritual causal attributions with higher levels of desired social distance are found. The results imply that interventions to mitigate stigma in faith communities should consider differences by condition types and the particular characteristics of faith-based settings.

Abstract = {Rapid advances in the genetics of psychiatric disorders mean that diagnostic and predictive genetic testing for schizophrenia risk may one day be a reality. This study examined how causal attributions for schizophrenia contribute to interest in a hypothetical genetic test. People with schizophrenia and first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia were recruited through a schizophrenia research bank and mental health organisation. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 13 individuals with schizophrenia and 8 first-degree relatives. Transcripts were subjected to a qualitative analysis using the thematic analysis framework. Five themes were developed: (i) "It is like a cocktail", with most participants aware that both genetic and environmental factors contributed to causation, and many mentioning the positive impact of genetic causal explanations; (ii) "Knowledge is power" (i.e., in favour of genetic testing); (iii) Genetic testing provides opportunities for early intervention and avoiding triggers, with participants citing a wide range of perceived benefits of genetic testing but few risks; (iv) Views on reproductive genetic testing for schizophrenia risk with a few participants viewing it as "playing God" but not necessarily being against it; and (v) "It snowballs", whereby participants' understanding of genetics was sophisticated with most believing that multiple rather than single genes contributed to schizophrenia. In conclusion, many individuals had a sound understanding of the role of genetic testing if it were to become available, with evidence of insight into the role of multiple genes and the contribution of other risk factors that may interact with any inherited genetic risk.

Abstract = {In the present study, we recruited a large sample (N = 595) of highly educated participants to assess which causal variables they considered as more important in the etiology of two diagnostically unlabeled cases of psychiatric disorders. The first clinical case described a patient with early schizophrenia whereas the second clinical case described a patient with conversion disorder. We aimed at ascertaining if participants' gender, field of study (scientific vs. humanistic), and personality traits influenced their causal beliefs. Based on the scores assigned to both the clinical cases, participants believed that current life stressors were the most important etiological variable and that adverse early experiences were not an important causal factor in anyone of the two clinical cases. Regardless of their field of study, women perceived the loss of a loved one as a relevant variable in the etiology of conversion disorder. Participants' beliefs about the etiology of early schizophrenia varied with their field of study. Compared to participants studying humanities, those studying scientific disciplines attributed more importance to organic causes and less importance to unconscious conflict and early traumatic experiences. Overall, the role of personality traits in influencing causal beliefs was negligible. Public education about the causes of psychopathology is necessary to optimize actual usage of mental health services and treatment choice for psychiatric disorders.; Competing Interests: Competing interests: None.

Abstract = {Purpose Although common mental disorders (CMDs) highly impact individuals and society, a knowledge gap exists on how sickness absence can be prevented in workers with CMDs. This study explores: (1) workers' perceived causes of sickness absence; (2) perceived return to work (RTW) barriers and facilitators; and (3) differences between workers with short, medium and long-term sickness absence. Methods A longitudinal qualitative study was conducted involving 34 workers with CMDs. Semi-structured interviews were held at two time-points during their RTW process. The 68 interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and thematically analyzed to explore workers' perspective on sickness absence causes, RTW barriers and facilitators, and compare data across the three sub-groups of workers. Results Workers reported various causes for their absence, including: (1) high work pressure; (2) poor work relationships; (3) unhelpful thoughts and feelings, e.g. lacking self-insight; and (4) ineffective coping behaviors. According to workers, RTW was facilitated by work adjustments, fulfilling relationships with supervisors, and adequate occupational health guidance. Workers with short-term leave more often reported favorable work conditions, and proactive coping behavior. In contrast, the long-term group reported reactive coping behavior and dissatisfaction with their work. Conclusion Supporting workers with CMDs in gaining self-awareness and regaining control, discussing the value of their work, and creating work conditions that enable workers to do valuable work, seem central for successful RTW and might prevent sickness absence. Supervisors play a key role in enabling workers to do valuable work and further research should focus on how supervisors can be supported in this task. (© 2021. The Author(s).)},

Abstract = {This paper takes its cue from those given at the conference Psychotherapy and Healthy Masculinity. These prompted the author to reflect on how he experienced masculinity as a psychotherapist working with families within NHS England’s CAMHS. The difficulties in children leading to their referral demonstrated a problematic parenting in which the diminished role of the father was causal. Beliefs about masculinity held within the family matrix were largely ones that functioned to fill epistemic lacunae. Such filling represents a double injustice. Not only is there very little empirically based thinking about fathers in our western culture for families to draw upon to make sense of their experiences. Instead, this dearth is often falsely compensated through ideologically derived pejorative concepts, that invariably do not relate to experience. The paper discusses the perniciousness of relying upon ideological perceptions of masculinity through focusing upon how easily they are acquired and)},

Abstract = {Abstract Introduction Malingering can be divided into simulation and exaggeration of symptoms. Malingering has traditionally been considered rare in general psychiatry. In contrast to earlier estimates, more recent studies report that doctors suspect malingering frequently in psychiatric emergency departments. The aim of this study is to survey how often doctors in psychiatric emergency units in a public, free-of-charge, mental health service suspect that patients are malingering, and which diagnoses, symptom complaints and suspected reasons for malingering doctors ascribe to their patients. Methods Questionnaires were distributed in three psychiatric emergency departments in Denmark. Suspected simulation and exaggeration were rated with a 5-point scale. Doctors were encouraged to write down the symptoms and perceived causes for suspected malingering. Results 362 questionnaires were filled in. 25% of all patients were suspected of simulating to some degree. 8% of patients were highly suspected or definitely believed to be simulating. Patients complaining of suicidal ideation were most frequently suspected of malingering. ‘Attention seeking’ was the most common suspected reason for malingering. Patients with diagnoses of substance use and personality disorder were the most suspected of malingering. Conclusion This is the first study to investigate doctors’ suspicions of psychiatric malingering in a European setting. Patients with established personality and substance use disorder are at higher risk of being suspected of malingering, which potentially affects the course of treatment significantly. The rise in suspected malingering is conspicuous and requires further investigation. Doctors are encouraged to act conservatively upon suspicion of malingering in emergency psychiatry.

Abstract = {Objective: To conduct a large-scale national cohort study to identify the current etiological risk factors for problem gambling in Canada. Method: A cohort of 10,119 Canadian gamblers completed a comprehensive self-administered online questionnaire in 2018 and were reassessed in 2019. At baseline, the sample contained 1,388 at-risk gamblers, 1,346 problem gamblers, and 2,710 with a major DSM-5 mental health disorder. A total of 108 independent variables (IVs) were available for analysis, as well as the self-report of perceived causes of gambling-related problems for 1,261 individuals. Results: The strongest multivariate predictors of current and future problem gambling were 'gambling-related' variables (i.e., current and past problem gambling, intensive gambling involvement, playing electronic gambling machines (EGMs), gambling fallacies, socializing with other people having gambling-related problems, and family history of having gambling-related problems).

Abstract = {Schizophrenia often follows a chronic or recurrent course, placing an immense burden on patients and their families. Mental health services in Cambodia are still highly limited, thus there is a major treatment gap. It is common that people consult traditional healers ( Kru Khmer ) and monks. In this culture, people who receive psychiatric medical treatment are expected to exhibit higher mental health literacy, but little is known about this factor. In this study, we interviewed 59 patients with schizophrenia and 59 family caregivers attending psychiatric clinics in Cambodia. Through qualitative analysis using a thematic analysis approach, we extracted eight themes of causal beliefs regarding schizophrenia: (1) spiritual beliefs, (2) cultural symptoms, (3) physical problems, (4) heredity, (5) substance abuse, (6) traumatic events, (7) stress in human relationships or in one's social environment, and (8) socioeconomic position. We found that "thinking too much" ( kit chroeun ) and "worrying too much" ( prouy / barom chroeun ), cultural idioms of distress, were recognized as causal factors of schizophrenia by both parents and family caregivers. Some participants were aware of the possible causal factors in light of the latest psychiatry findings, such as genetic factors and childhood trauma. Our data show that causal beliefs are not a decisive factor in shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP). In Cambodia, where the treatment for schizophrenia is pluralistic, we suggest that it is crucial to embed the meaning of psychiatric treatment into local meaning worlds for better help-seeking behaviors.},

Abstract = {Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19 hotspots worldwide have reported poor mental health outcomes since the pandemic's beginning. The virulence of the initial COVID-19 surge in Spain and the urgency for rapid evidence constrained early studies in their capacity to inform mental health programs accurately. Here, we used a qualitative research design to describe relevant mental health problems among frontline HCWs and explore their association with determinants and consequences and their implications for the design and implementation of mental health programs.; Materials and Methods: Following the Programme Design, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation (DIME) protocol, we used a two-step qualitative research design to interview frontline HCWs, mental health experts, administrators, and service planners in Spain. We used Free List (FL) interviews to identify problems experienced by frontline HCWs and Key informant (KI) interviews to describe them and explore their determinants and consequences, as well as the strategies considered useful to overcome these problems. We used a thematic analysis approach to analyze the interview outputs and framed our results into a five-level social-ecological model (intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public health).; Results: We recruited 75 FL and 22 KI interviewees, roughly balanced in age and gender. We detected 56 themes during the FL interviews and explored the following themes in the KI interviews: fear of infection, psychological distress, stress, moral distress, and interpersonal conflicts among coworkers. We found that interviewees reported perceived causes and consequences across problems at all levels (intrapersonal to public health). Although several mental health strategies were implemented (especially at an intrapersonal and interpersonal level), most mental health needs remained unmet, especially at the organizational, community, and public policy levels.; Conclusions: In keeping with available quantitative evidence, our findings show that mental health problems are still relevant for frontline HCWs 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic and that many reported causes of these problems are modifiable. Based on this, we offer specific recommendations to design and implement mental health strategies and recommend using transdiagnostic, low-intensity, scalable psychological interventions contextually adapted and tailored for HCWs.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Abstract = {Background: Ovarian masses may be either physiological or pathological. Physiological ovarian masses are non-neoplastic. Pathological masses grow more than 7 cm and persist beyond 3 months; they do not resolve spontaneously, and invasive surgery with removal of reproductive organs is the conventional treatment. It usually results in further co-morbidities and hampers the quality of life of the patient.; Objectives: This case series of pathological left ovarian masses demonstrates the role of homeopathic treatment in each of two multiparous women where the right ovary was surgically removed previously for similar pathology and in an adolescent girl with increased tumor marker CA-125.; Methods: Three cases of women with pathological ovarian masses in the left ovary, and advised invasive surgery by attending gynecologists, were treated with homeopathic medicines at the outpatient department of the National Homeopathy Research Institute in Mental Health, Kottayam, Kerala, from 2017 to 2020. Each case was followed up with clinical and ultrasonographic evidence and reported according to the criteria set out in the HOM-CASE guidelines.; Result: Complete resolution of the ovarian masses was observed in all three cases, evidenced by ultrasonography, with normalizing CA-125 values also observed in the case of endometrial cyst. The patients improved within 4 to 15 months of treatment using Thuja and other individualized homeopathic medicines. The MONARCH score was calculated as +7/13, +9/13, and +9/13 for the three cases, respectively, indicating a positive causal attribution of homeopathy in the resolution of these pathological ovarian masses.; Conclusion: This case series suggests that individualized homeopathy, and notably Thuja , can be useful in the treatment of pathological ovarian masses.; Competing Interests: None declared.

Abstract = {Laypersons' causal beliefs about mental disorders can differ considerably from medical or psychosocial clinicians' models as they are shaped by social and cultural context and by personal experiences. This study aimed at identifying differences in causal beliefs about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by country and gender. A cross-sectional, vignette-based online survey was conducted with 737 participants from Germany, Greece, Ecuador, Mexico, and Russia. Participants were presented with a short unlabeled case vignette describing a person with symptoms of PTSD. Causal beliefs were assessed using an open-ended question asking for the three most likely causes. Answers were analyzed using thematic analysis. Afterwards, themes were transformed into categorical variables to analyze differences by country and by gender. Qualitative analyses revealed a wide range of different causal beliefs. Themes differed by gender, with women tending to mention more external causal beliefs. Themes also differed between the five countries but the differences between countries were more pronounced for women than for men. In conclusion, causal beliefs were multifaceted among laypersons and shared basic characteristics with empirically derived risk factors. The more pronounced differences for women suggest that potential gender effects should be considered in cross-cultural research.; Competing Interests: The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Abstract = {Inferring causes of the good and bad events that we experience is part of the process of building models of our own capabilities and of the world around us. Making such inferences can be difficult because of complex reciprocal relationships between attributions of the causes of particular events, and beliefs about the capabilities and skills that influence our role in bringing them about. Abnormal causal attributions have long been studied in connection with psychiatric disorders, notably depression and paranoia; however, the mechanisms behind attributional inferences and the way they can go awry are not fully understood. We administered a novel, challenging, game of skill to a substantial population of healthy online participants, and collected trial-by-trial time series of both their beliefs about skill and attributions about the causes of the success and failure of real experienced outcomes. We found reciprocal relationships that provide empirical confirmation of the attribution-self representation cycle theory. This highlights the dynamic nature of the processes involved in attribution, and validates a framework for developing and testing computational accounts of attribution-belief interactions.; Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.},

Abstract = {Objectives International students face increased vulnerability for mental health challenges, but underutilize counseling compared to their domestic peers. We examined beliefs regarding the causes of mental illness, known as attributions, which may impact treatment-seeking and stigma. Participants: Surveys were collected from 680 international students at U.S. universities. Methods: We sent invitations to a computer-based survey disseminated via international student email lists. The survey explored mental health attributions for depression, alcohol use disorder, and schizophrenia. Results: Attributions differed significantly by disorder. Depression and alcohol use were attributed to social stress and perceived as controllable and influenced by personal weakness and lifestyle choices. Schizophrenia was often attributed to hereditary/biological causes. Differences also emerged based on the participants' acculturation, region of origin, and religiosity. Conclusions: Attributions influence perceptions of mental illness and may lead to stigma. Providers should incorporate discussions of attribution in student outreach and counseling to address potential impacts on care-seeking.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Limited information is known from studies regarding traditional, religious, and cultural perspectives on mental illness and the use of traditional and alternative therapies by mentally ill people in Indonesia. This study explored traditional, religious, and cultural beliefs about causes of mental illness and the use of traditional/alternative treatments for mentally ill patients. Method: We adopted a qualitative content analysis method as proposed by Schreier. This study was conducted at a mental Hospital in Indonesia. We interviewed 15 nurses and 15 patients. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis method. Results: Five discrete but interrelated themes emerged: 1) Possessed illness and belief in supernatural forces; 2) Sinful or cursed illness; 3) Witchcraft or human-made illness; 4) traditional/alternative treatments; and 5) Barriers to treatment of mental illness. Conclusion: Traditional/alternative treatments play an important role in meeting the need for mental health treatment. The findings are relevant for mental health nurses who provide direct to their patients, and for other areas of mental health practice. We also found a lack of knowledge about the causes of mental illness among patients and families. Education should be at the heart of mental health promotion to raise the level of mental health literacy in Indonesia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},
