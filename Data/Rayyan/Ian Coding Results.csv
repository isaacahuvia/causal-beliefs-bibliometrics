rayyan-470329163,The Role Of Medication In The Attributional Processes Of Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,2001,1,1,NA,,,,,INGRAM AK,,,,,"Despite the widespread use of stimulant medication in treating children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), relatively little is known about the psychological effects of this form of treatment. It has been argued that children with adhd may develop maladaptive attributional patterns if they explain their achievements as the result of taking medication. The current study examined the attributional patterns of adhd children receiving medication for six months or more. A new measure, the comprehensive attribution questionnaire, was developed to assess the extent to which these children attribute success and failure to medication as well as to traditional attributional dimensions. Fifty-one adhd students and fifty-one matched, non-adhd students completed the comprehensive attribution questionnaire and the children's multidimensional self-efficacy scales (cmss). Adhd children were less likely to attribute success and failure experiences to medication effects than to other causes. No definitive differences between the attributional patterns of adhd and control children were identified. Furthermore, medication attributions were not found to significantly predict academic self-efficacy. These results suggest that long-term stimulant treatment does not have a deleterious effect on the attributional processes of children with adhd. Current findings are consistent with the existing research based on short-term medication trials.

rayyan-470329165,Children's Attributions Of Their Severely Mentally Ill Parent's Symptomatic Behavior: A Retrospective Study,1999,1,1,NA,,,,,BOURKE AB,,,,,"This dissertation study examined the causal attributions made by 30 adult children for their severely mentally ill parent's symptomatic behaviors. A retrospective methodology was used in order to explore the development of attributions from their first realization that their parent was behaving in a problematic manner to the present time. This study also explored the associations between attributions and participants' levels of coping and resiliency, as defined by their present functioning. The results of this study lend support to the use of an attributional framework in the study of children of the mentally ill. The data gathered using the adult children of the mentally ill-attribution scale (acmi-as) indicated reasonable internal consistency and expected intercorrelations of the attribution stems. A factor analysis of participants' responses to the acmi-as revealed three factors, including internal to self, internal to parent and predictability. The data suggested that participants' attributions significantly changed from their initial realization of parental symptomatic behavior to the present time. The analysis indicated that maturity was not wholly responsible for the change in attributions. Rather, the subjective amount of information concerning mental illness as well as extra-familial support were significant contributing factors. The analyses between attributions and coping as well as between attributions and resiliency suggested a relationship between these variables. The data further suggested that attributions for parental control of the symptomatic behavior or personal control by the child were associated with increased psychopathology and lower self-esteem and self-efficacy in respondents. Attributions that highlighted predictability, external causation, and biological causation were associated with fewer somatic complaints and increased social self-efficacy.

Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) investigations revealed neurobiological correlates of these deficits, raising the hypothesis of a common basis in midbrain dopaminergic signaling. However, investigations of drug-naïve first-episode patients with comprehensive fmri tasks are still missing. We recruited unmedicated schizophrenia spectrum patients (n = 27) and healthy control subjects (n = 27) matched for sex, age and educational levels. An established monetary reward anticipation task in combination with a novel task aiming at implicit salience attribution without the confound of monetary incentive was applied. Patients showed reduced right ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation. Furthermore, patients with a more pronounced hypoactivation attributed more salience to neutral stimuli, had more positive symptoms and better executive functioning. In the patient group, a more differentially active striatum during reward anticipation was correlated positively to differential ventral striatal activation in the implicit salience attribution task. In conclusion, a deficit in ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation can already be seen in drug-naïve, first episode schizophrenia patients. The data suggest that rather a deficit in differential ventral striatal activation than a generally reduced activation underlies motivational deficits in schizophrenia and that this deficit is related to the aberrant salience attribution.

A community sample of 232 participants completed a questionnaire consisting of a vignette-identification task, a ratings task of 45 attitudinal items about psychopathy, and demographics. Analysis of the vignette-identification data showed that participants were significantly less likely to correctly identify a case of psychopathy than they were of either depression or schizophrenia. Factors derived from principal components analysis of the attitudinal items revealed that participants generally believed psychopaths to be intelligent and to have criminal tendencies, and that psychopathy was likely caused by early trauma and stress. Overall, participants may have had monological beliefs about the manifestations, aetiology, and treatments of psychopathy. These results suggest that educational programmes are required to improve mental health literacy in relation to psychopathy among the general public.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,PSYCHOPATHY;MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY;MENTAL DISORDERS;ANTISOCIAL;PERSONALITY DISORDER,,

The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between demographic variables, perceived stress, dysfunctional attitudes, attribution style, and depression among turkish college students. A hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the sequential effect of perceived stress, dysfunctional attitudes, attribution style on depression severity of turkish college students. Overall, the model explained 42% of depression severity, which is considered a large effect size explaining factors contributing to depression among turkish college students. The results indicated dysfunctional attitudes directly contributed depression severity among turkish college students; however, attribution style may influence depression through perceived stress as well. Participants with negative and internal attribution styles might perceive a high level of stress as they might attribute problems to themselves leading a higher level of depression. Mental health professionals who are working with students may check dysfunctional attitudes, and the attribution style of students and provide insight regarding the cognitive aspect of depression.

Method: we recruited 125 undergraduates to rate the degree to which each of 41 listed reasons influenced their abstention from six specific substances (alcohol, mdma/ecstasy, inhalants, cocaine, marijuana, and hallucinogens). Findings: internal consistency analyses revealed reliable subscales of reasons reflecting themes such as perceived harmful effects, absence of enjoyment, likely loss of control, effects on one's body, inconsistency with one's values and self-image, and difficulty acquiring the substance. Men and women rarely differed significantly in the reported importance of different types of reasons for abstaining. Perceived lack of enjoyment was rated as the most influential type of reason for abstaining regardless of drug type. Difficulty acquiring drugs and concerns about failing a drug test were rated as having a small influence on abstinence regardless of drug type. Conclusions: our results are consistent with previous research that found anticipated interpersonal and performance problems reportedly inhibit drug taking, but that difficulty acquiring drugs and drug testing concerns reportedly have little influence on motivation for abstinence. Education and prevention messages may have more impact to the degree that they emphasize those consequences young persons find meaningful.

I suggest that these debates are based on false dichotomies. According to metaphysical physicalism, reality is ultimately physical. Although this view excludes the idea of entities distinct from physical reality, it does not compel us to favour neural over psychological interventions. According to methodological dualism, both physical and mental interventions on the world can be deemed effective, and both perspectives can therefore be thought to be equally real.

Compared with whites, racial/ethnic minority adolescents are more likely to be affected by mental disorders but less likely to use mental health services. This systematic review aimed to summarize factors related to mental health service use among minority adolescents in the u.s. As identified in previous research. Methodology: following the prisma guideline, we systematically searched seven databases for peer reviewed articles related to barriers and facilitators of mental health service use among racial/ethnic minority adolescents. Results: thirty-two quantitative studies met our inclusion criteria, among which 12 studies (37.5\%) sampled mostly blacks or african americans, 6 studies (18.7\%) focused primarily on hispanics or latin/a/x, including mexican americans and puerto ricans, and 4 studies (12.5\%) were mostly asian americans (e.g., chinese, vietnamese). Based on the socio-ecological framework, 21 studies (65.6\%) identified adolescent-related barriers and facilitators of mental health service use, including biological (e.g., age, gender), clinical (e.g., symptom severity), behavioral (e.g., drug/alcohol use), and psychological characteristics (e.g., internal asset) of minority youth. Ten studies (31.3\%) identified parents-related factors that influenced minority adolescent mental health service use, including parental perceptions and beliefs, family and parenting issues, and demographic characteristics. Primary factors at the therapist level included ethnic match between patient and practitioner, relationship with healthcare practitioners, and patient-therapist co-endorsement of etiological beliefs. Fifteen studies (46.9\%) identified factors influencing minority adolescent mental health service use at the contextual/structural level, including household income, insurance status, and family structure. Lastly, acculturation and school experiences were major factors at the social/cultural level that influence minority adolescent service use. Conclusion: more empirical studies are needed to understand the mechanism underlying minority adolescents' unmet mental health service needs. Culturally competent interventions are warranted to engage minority adolescents with mental disorders into treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE USE;ADOLESCENT;YOUTH;RACIAL;ETHNIC MINORITIES;;FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS;SYSTEMATIC REVIEW;Mental Health Services;Adolescent;Health Services,,

We focus on the fact that mental health practitioners and service users often have in common neither their cultural backgrounds nor their explanatory models of illness. Even in a shared language, communication can be less than optimal as words carry multiple meanings. Consequently, consultations that involve culturally grounded explanatory models of illness challenge the professional. We give examples showing that reconciling different explanatory models during the consultation is a core task for psychiatrists and mental health practitioners working in multicultural settings.

These statistical techniques revealed that attributional style was poorly related with depression level, whereas the negative cognitive triad showed a close relationship and provided a more accurate description of the depressive cognitive pattern. We also document how the lorenz curve and gini index can be used to assess the predictive capacity of different instruments or the strength of the relationship between different variables and psychological disorders, and to evaluate different models proposed to explain these disorders. This pioneering study reveals the potential usefulness in psychology of these statistical techniques, mainly used in economical sciences, for analyzing the validity of different factors and possible predictors of specific psychological disorders, or to enhance existing instruments, as our present study with depression shows.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,DEPRESSION;LORENZ CURVE;GINI INDEX;ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE;NEGATIVE;COGNITIVE TRIAD;EX POST FACTO PROSPECTIVE STUDY;Depression;Cognition,,

Accumulating evidence suggests diabetes distress may be linked to individuals' emotion regulation capacities. Thus, we conducted two studies to elucidate a model for how emotion regulation impacts diabetes distress and a(1c) levels and determine preliminary effect size estimates for an intervention targeting poor emotion regulation on glycemic control. Methods: study i used structural equation modeling to assess the cross-sectional relationships between these variables in a sample of 216 individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Study ii built on findings from study i that highlighted the role of emotion regulation capacities in diabetes distress and a(1c) by conducting a pilot study of an emotion-focused behavioral intervention compared to treatment as usual in a sample of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Results: study i examined two potential explanatory models with one of the models (model ii) showing a more comprehensive view of the data revealing a total effect of poor emotional regulation of 42\% of all effects on a(1c) levels. Study ii tested an emotion-focused behavioral intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to treatment as usual and found medium sized reductions in a(1c) levels and smaller reductions in diabetes distress that correlated with changes in emotion regulation. Conclusions: these studies suggest that, in people with diabetes, elevated a(1c) levels and diabetes distress are linked with poor emotion regulation. While the effect sizes from study 2 are preliminary, an emotion-focused behavioral intervention may reduce both a(1c) and diabetes distress levels, through improvements in emotion regulation.

The aims of the study were to investigate whether (i) patients with lifetime presence of non-affective psychosis show an external-personal attribution bias for negative events, (ii) this attribution style can also be detected in first-degree relatives of patients with psychosis and subjects with subclinical psychotic experiences, and (iii) this attribution style is related to the presence of psychotic symptoms, in particular delusions. Method. Participants were 23 patients with lifetime presence of non-affective psychosis, a high-risk group of 36 first-degree relatives of patients with non-affective psychosis, a high-risk group of 31 subjects with subclinical psychotic experiences and 46 normal controls. Attribution style was measured by the internal, personal and situational attribution questionnaire. Positive symptoms were assessed with the present state examination (pse) and the scale for the assessment of positive symptoms (saps). Results. Relative to the controls, an externalizing bias was apparent in the patient group (beta=0(.)20, p=0(.)03) but not in the two high-risk groups. There was a dose-response association between externalizing bias and the delusions subscale of the pse (relative to lowest level: highest level of delusions: beta=0(.)53, p=0(.)04; intermediate levels of delusions: beta=0(.)23, p=0(.)35). No significant differences were found in personalizing bias between the four groups. Conclusions. Patients with psychosis tend to use an externalizing bias in their explanations of negative social events, and this bias is associated with the presence of positive psychotic symptoms, in particular delusions.

Participants: a total of 371 active duty service members (sms) with documented history of mtbi, divided into combat and non-combat-related cohorts. Design: retrospective cohort study. Main measures: diagnoses of ptsd and depression based on medical record review and self-report. Pcss measured using neurobehavioral symptom index. Attribution of symptoms based on a rating scale asking how much mtbi, ptsd, depression, deployment, or readjustment stress contributed to current symptoms. Results: prevalence of ptsd was significantly higher after a combat-related mtbi, compared with a noncombat mtbi (p = .001). Prevalence of depression did not differ between the 2 groups. Pcss were high in both combat and noncombat mtbis, with no statistical difference between groups. Sms with ptsd reported higher pcs, regardless of combat status. Sms without ptsd attributed symptoms mainly to mtbi, whereas sms with ptsd, regardless of combat status, were much more likely to attribute symptoms to ptsd, depression, and deployment/readjustment stress. Conclusions: this research contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between mtbi and ptsd in both combat and noncombat injuries within the military population and the importance of addressing both simultaneously.

Methodfour hundred three japanese and 256 australian female university students (aged 17-35 years) completed a questionnaire that gauged beliefs about the causes of bn. Resultsamong the australian women, the four-component structure of perceived causes (dieting and eating practices, family dynamics, socio-cultural pressure, and psychological vulnerability) found in dryer et al. (2012) was replicated. Among the japanese women, however, a three-component structure (without the psychological vulnerability component) was obtained. The groups also differed in the causal component they most strongly endorsed, that being socio-cultural pressure for the australian women, and dieting and eating practices for the japanese women. Discussionthe japanese participants were found to endorse three out of the four western-based causal explanations for bn, but the relative importance they placed on those explanations differed from that of the australian participants. Further research is needed, particularly to establish whether japanese women simply fail to see psychological vulnerability as a viable cause of bn, or there are in fact cultural differences in the extent to which such vulnerability causes bn.

Method: ninety-one participants recruited from the community completed questionnaires targeting perceptions about 4 individuals: a healthy person, a person with asthma, a person with schizophrenia, and a person with an. Results: evaluations of personal characteristics were most negative for persons with an. Participants believed the person with an was most to blame for his/her condition, was best able to pull him/her-self together if he/she wanted to, and was most acting this way for attention and that biological factors were least relevant in developing the illness. Conclusion: negative perceptions of a person with an fell into stigma categories of self-attribution and responsibility.

rayyan-470329188,Anxiety Sensitivity Dimensions And Prediction Of Fearful Responding To Interoceptive Exposure Exercises,2003,1,1,NA,,,,,DEACON BJ,,,,,"Anxiety sensitivity (as), the tendency to fear one's own anxiety symptoms based on beliefs about their harmful consequences, reliably predicts fearful responding to a variety of tasks that produce strong interoceptive (i.e., somatic) sensations. Consistent with the idea that panic may result from the interaction between fears of specific anxiety symptoms and the experience of congruent anxiety symptoms, panic induction studies have consistently found that fears of the anxiety symptoms produced by a particular panic induction task are the strongest predictor of fearful responding to that task. These studies suggest that the predictive ability of as in panic induction studies can be significantly enhanced by measuring the construct at the multidimensional level, and that fears of specific types of anxiety symptoms might provide a more powerful explanatory model for predicting emotional responding to aversive stimuli. The goal of the present study was to examine the ability four as dimensions assessed by the anxiety sensitivity index - revised to predict fearful responding to four interoceptive exposure exercises in a nonclinical sample. Seventy-two undergraduate participants completed measures of as, anxiety symptoms, trait anxiety, and panic attack history. Participants then engaged in four exercises: (1) shaking their head quickly from side to side for 90 seconds, (2) running in place for 120 seconds, (3) breathing through a thin coffee straw for as long as possible over two consecutive trials, and (4) reading a prepared speech out loud into a video camera about feeling anxious while experiencing publicly observable anxiety reactions. Each exercise elicited a pattern of fearful responding that was generally consistent with theoretical expectations. Global as was significantly and uniquely associated with fearful responding to each exercise with the exception of reading the speech, even after controlling for trait anxiety and panic attack history. State anxiety was the strongest predictor of fear, and as did not account for unique variance in fear after controlling for state anxiety. Contrary to prediction, as dimensions did not demonstrate an interpretable pattern of predicting fearful responding to the exercises. The results are discussed in terms of cognitive theories of panic, and limitations of the present study and directions for future research are addressed.

Aims: to seek a consensus on the factors that should be considered and how they should be sought when attributing mental ill-health to work. Methods: a three-round delphi study involving expert academics, occupational physicians, psychiatrists and psychologists. We deemed consensus had been reached when 66% or more of the experts were in agreement. Results: of 54 invited experts, 35 (65%) took part in the first round, 30 of these 35 (86%) in the second and 29 of these 30 (97%) in the final round. Consensus was reached for 11 workplace stressors: high job strain; effortreward imbalance; major trauma; interpersonal conflict; inadequate support; role ambiguity; personjob mismatch; organizational injustice; organizational culture; work scheduling and threats to job security. Seven personal factors were identified as being important: previous mental illness; personality traits of neuroticism; adverse life events or social circumstances; resilience; a family history of mental illness and secondary gain. The worker, manager and co-workers were thought to be the most useful sources of workplace information. Consensus was reached for a definition of occupational mental illness but not for a threshold of work-relatedness. Conclusions: the attribution of mental ill-health to work is complex and involves the consideration of both workplace stressors and personal factors of vulnerability. Clinical consultation with an occupational physician who is familiar with the workplace is central to the process.

Furthermore, negative societal reactions and the internalization of these attitudes exacerbate the difficulties encountered. This study examines the perspectives of turkish people with schizophrenia on how they view the impact of the illness on their lives, the societal reactions and attitudes to schizophrenia and whether they agree with these reactions. Methods: twenty-three adult participants, all members of two schizophrenia associations in ankara, capital of turkey, were recruited. Semistructured interviews were used to find out their perspectives on how the illness affected their lives, how the society reacts to them and their views on these reactions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematic analysis was used to capture the general and the subthemes. Results: the findings suggest that causal attributions for the illness, the impact of illness on various life domains, challenges of living with the illness and finally stigmatization are general categories that capture the perspectives of the participants. Conclusion: people diagnosed with schizophrenia experience the impacts and burdens of their illness in various domains of their lives and negative societal reactions heighten these burdens. It seems important to consider the challenges faced by people with schizophrenia in living with their illness and the impacts of negative societal behaviors and attitudes in offering psychosocial interventions programs for supporting this group.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations of depression and anxiety with feelings of stigma among patients in saudi arabia who have recovered from covid-19. Materials and methods: a cross-sectional survey was conducted between july and december 2020. Trained healthcare providers contacted and interviewed participants by phone. Depression, anxiety, and stigma were assessed using the patient health questionnaire (phq-9), the generalized anxiety disorder (gad-7) questionnaire, and the explanatory model interview catalogue stigma scale (emic). Data on sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and family history of mental illness were also collected. Multiple linear regression models were performed to explore factors associated with depression and anxiety. Results: a total of 174 adult participants (>= 18 years old) who had recently recovered from covid-19 were interviewed. The mean phq-9 and gad-7 scores were 7.53 (+/- 5.04) and 3.77 (+/- 4.47), respectively. About 68\% of the participants had at least mild depression (phq-9 score of 5-9), whereas only 29.89\% had at least mild anxiety (gad-7 score of 5-9) during their infections with covid-19. Multiple linear regression showed that females were more vulnerable to depression and anxiety disorders than their male counterparts were (beta=3.071 and beta=1.86, respectively). Notably, participants' stigma scores were significantly associated with higher scores on depression and anxiety. Conclusion: these findings highlight the negative consequences of covid-19 infection on the mental health of recovered patients. Therefore, considerable attention from local and international health authorities is needed to improve the mental well-being of recovered covid-19 patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,MENTAL HEALTH;DEPRESSION;ANXIETY;STIGMA;SAUDI ARABIA;Anxiety,,

Case finding for depression is challenging because individuals often do not recognize the symptoms in themselves or may resist the diagnosis as a result of cultural stigma. Screening instruments, to be accurate, must be valid in the particular setting in which they are being applied, and diagnosis in primary care settings, is further made challenging because patients often present with a wide variety of somatic symptoms that could be medical. 115 women were screened for depression in this study in one community in uganda, and 87 were found to be depressed using the srq-20. The cognitive impairment and decreased energy sub-scales of the srq-20 seemed to best differentiate for depression. We then interviewed the 87 women and found that, overwhelmingly, their complaints were somatic, and that their expectation for treatment was to receive medical tests and medications. Caregivers in primary care clinics in uganda should know that in the reporting of their somatic symptoms patients may be trying to communicate more about themselves than just the state of their physical health; and that feelings of uselessness or of hopelessness when expressed by a patient should lead them to suspect severe mental illness since these symptoms were not found to be characteristic of the milder depression that is highly prevalent in ugandan women.

In a developing country like jordan, type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) has reached a prevalence rate of 17.1%. This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between self-care activities and: illness perception, depression, social support, religiosity and spiritual coping, and self-efficacy among patients with t2dm. A random sample of 220 patients with t2dm, who attended jordan university hospital in jordan were enrolled. The data were collected through a structured interview and the medical files. The instruments consisted of a sociodemographic and clinical standardised questionnaires: brief illness perception questionnaire, patients' health questionnaire-9; enrich social support instrument; religious and spiritual coping subscale; diabetes management self-efficacy scale; and summary of diabetes self-care activities. Bivariate analysis investigated the relationship between variables. Structure equation modelling (sem) was performed to test the proposed conceptual model. The study found that approximately 70% of the respondents suffered some form of depressive symptoms. The sem showed a direct relationship between self-efficacy and self-care activities (ß = 0.40; p < 0.001). Depression was indirectly related to self-care activities through self-efficacy (ß = -0.20; p = 0.003); nevertheless, it was directly related to perception of: treatment control, consequences, and emotional representations.

Method: using a historical approach, we analysed the evolution of the diagnostic descriptions of the two disorders, giving attention to the influence of social change and scientific research. Results: the two disorders have developed in remarkably similar ways; people have been and still are much inclined to make moral judgments about these disorders than about other psychic disorders. Neurobiological research has added a extra dimension to the debate on topics such as impulsivity, personal responsibility and free will.

The difficulties that researchers face when epidemiological studies require assessment of psychological phenomena, such as depression, across different cultural settings are explored. Methods: relevant papers were sought on the epidemiology of diabetes and depression in people with diabetes by undertaking a literature search of electronic databases including medline, psych-info, cinahl and embase. These papers were assessed by the authors and a narrative review of the relevant literature was composed. Results: systematic reviews of the prevalence of depression in people with diabetes have focused on studies conducted in english speaking countries and emerging data suggest that there may be international variations in prevalence and also in how symptoms of depression are reported. There appears to be a bi-directional relationship between depression and diabetes, with one influencing the other; however, research in this area is further complicated by the fact that potential risk factors for depression in people with diabetes often interact with each other and with other factors. Further research is needed to elucidate the causal mechanisms underlying these associations. Limitations: data from non-english speaking countries remain scarce and so it is difficult to come to any firm conclusions as to the international variation in prevalence rates of co-morbid diabetes and depression in these countries until further research has been conducted. Conclusion: it is important to take a culture-centered approach to our understanding of mental health and illness and consider the key issues related to the development of culturally sensitive depression screening tools. In order to come to any firm conclusions about the international variation in prevalence of co-morbid diabetes and depression, issues of culture and diversity must be taken into account prior to conducting international epidemiological studies.

Exercise at moderate intensity may confer neuroprotective benefits in multiple sclerosis (ms), however it has been reported that people with ms (pwms) exercise less than national guideline recommendations. We aimed to determine predictors of moderate to vigorous exercise among a sample of older canadians with ms who were divided into ambulatory (less disabled) and non-ambulatory (more disabled) groups. Methods. We analysed data collected as part of a national survey of health, lifestyle and aging with ms. Participants (n = 743) were canadians over 55 years of age with ms for 20 or more years. We identified `a priori' variables (demographic, personal, socioeconomic, physical health, exercise history and health care support) that may predict exercise at moderate to vigorous intensity (>6.75 metabolic equivalent hours/week). Predictive variables were entered into stepwise logistic regression until best fit was achieved. Results. There was no difference in explanatory models between ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups. The model predicting exercise included the ability to walk independently (or 1.90, 95\% ci [1.24-2.91]); low disability (or 1.50, 95\% ci [1.34-1.68] for each 10 point difference in barthel index score), perseverance (or 1.17, 95\% ci [1.08-1.26] for each additional point on the scale of 0-14), less fatigue (or 2.01, 95\% ci [1.32-3.07] for those in the lowest quartile), fewer years since ms diagnosis (or 1.58, 95\% ci [1.11-2.23] below the median of 23 years) and fewer cardiovascular comorbidities (or 1.55 95\% ci [1.02-2.35] one or no comorbidities). It was also notable that the factors, age, gender, social support, health care support and financial status were not predictive of exercise. Conclusions. This is the first examination of exercise and exercise predictors among older, more disabled pwms. Disability is a major predictor of exercise participation (at moderate to vigorous levels) in both ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups suggesting that more exercise options must be developed for people with greater disability. Perseverance, fatigue, and cardiovascular comorbidities are predictors that are modifiable and potential targets for exercise adherence interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,DISABILITY;PHYSICAL ACTIVITY;REHABILITATION;EXERCISE BEHAVIOR;;PHYSIOTHERAPY;PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS;PERSEVERENCE;RESILIENCE;SELF-EFFICACY;DEPRESSION;Multiple Sclerosis,,

Aims to investigate whether the quality of medical care received by people with mental health conditions, including substance misuse, differs from the care received by people who have no comparable mental disorder. Method a systematic review of studies that examined the quality of medical care in those with and without mental illness was conducted using robust critical appraisal techniques. Results of 31 valid studies, 27 examined receipt of medical care in those with and without mental illness and 10 examined medical care in those with and without substance use disorder (or dual diagnosis). Nineteen of 27 and 10 of 10, respectively, suggested inferior quality of care in at least one domain. Twelve studies found no appreciable differences in care or failed to detect a difference in at least one key area. Several studies showed an increase in healthcare utilisation but without any increase in quality. Three studies found superior care for individuals with mental illness in specific subdomains. There was inadequate information concerning patient satisfaction and structural differences in healthcare delivery. There was also inadequate separation of delivery of care from uptake fit care on which to base causal explanations. Conclusions despite similar or more frequent medical contacts, there are often disparities in the physical healthcare delivered to those with psychiatric illness although the magnitude of this effect varies considerably.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Comorbidity,,

The heading of the conference was on cruelty and destructiveness. The paper takes as its starting point the composite figure of dr jekyll and mr hyde. It discusses the meaning of intentionality, or the lack of a conscious intention of being evil, in comparison to evil deeds caused by uninhibited drive satisfaction. Evilness is put into a social and a psycho-developmental context. Examples of contemporary atrocities are discussed, leading up to a formulation of a multi-factorial explanatory model of evil, taken from michael stones book the anatomy of evil.

The aim of this study was to examine the joint role of demographic, clinical and psychological risk factors in the development of moderate and severe ppsp after total knee and hip arthroplasty (tka and tha, respectively). This was a prospective study wherein a consecutive sample of 92 patients were assessed 24 hours before (t1), 48 hours after (t2) and 4-6 months (t3) after surgery. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of moderate and severe levels of ppsp. Four to six months after tka and tha, 54 patients (58.7%) reported none or mild pain (numerical rating scale: nrs = 3), whereas 38 (41.3%) reported moderate to severe pain (nrs >3). In the final multivariate hierarchical logistic regression analyses, illness representations concerning the condition leading to surgery (osteoarthritis), such as a chronic timeline perception of the disease, emerged as a significant predictor of ppsp. Additionally, post-surgical anxiety also showed a predictive role in the development of ppsp. Pre-surgical pain was the most significant clinical predictive factor and, as expected, undergoing tka was associated with greater odds of ppsp development than tha. The findings on ppsp predictors after major joint arthroplasties can guide clinical practice in terms of considering cognitive and emotional factors, together with clinical factors, in planning acute pain management before and after surgery.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,ANXIETY/*PSYCHOLOGY;ARTHROPLASTY;REPLACEMENT;HIP/*ADVERSE EFFECTS;KNEE/*ADVERSE EFFECTS;PAIN;POSTOPERATIVE/*PSYCHOLOGY;AGED;CHRONIC DISEASE;FEMALE;HUMANS;LOGISTIC MODELS;MALE;MIDDLE AGED;PAIN PERCEPTION;POSTOPERATIVE/DIAGNOSIS;POSTOPERATIVE/ETIOLOGY;POSTOPERATIVE/PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;PROGNOSIS;PROSPECTIVE STUDIES;RISK FACTORS;SEVERITY OF ILLNESS INDEX;SURVEYS AND QUESTIONNAIRES;Risk Factors;Arthroplasty,,

Causal attributions about bodily sensations may determine help-seeking and influence patients' demands for medical treatment. The present study aimed to differentiate the causal attributions associated with health-related and non-health-related anxiety. Methods. Anxious hypochondriacal, generally anxious, and non-anxious general practice attenders were compared on their propensity to give somatic, psychological or normalizing attributions for common bodily sensations, measured by number of each type of attribution in a given time period and the frequency of first response of each type. Results. The groups differed in all three types of attributions. Giving more psychological and fewer normalizing attributions was related to general anxiety whereas giving more somatic attributions was related specifically to hypochondriasis. Conclusions. Anxiety and hypochondriasis can be distinguished in terms of their associated patterns of attributions for bodily sensations, reinforcing the importance of attributional processes and interventions which use reattributional training.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Anxiety;Hypochondriasis,,

This purpose of the current study was to gather information regarding the public's recommendations regarding help-seeking for several anxiety disorders and to compare caucasian and african-american participants on these variables. A community sample of 577 us adults completed a telephone survey that included vignettes portraying individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (gad), social phobia/social anxiety disorder (sp/sad), panic disorder (pd), and for comparison, depression. The sample was 1/2 caucasian and 1/2 african american. Respondents were significantly less likely to recommend help-seeking for sp/sad and gad (78.8\% and 84.3\%, respectively) than for depression (90.9\%). In contrast, recommendations to seek help for panic disorder were common (93.6\%) and similar to rates found for depression. The most common recommendations were to seek help from a primary care physician (pcp). African americans were more likely to recommend help-seeking for gad than caucasians. Findings suggested that respondents believed individuals with anxiety disorders should seek treatment. Given that respondents often recommended consulting a pcp, we recommend educating pcps about anxiety disorders and empirically-supported interventions. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

The conceptual components of mental health recovery have been proposed, however, the barriers to their sustainability within the context of internal and external stressors require further exploration. Within their emerging adult role, young people will experience the personal challenges that will directly impact their understanding of their recovery, which will be different from other age groups. What the paper adds to existing knowledge? Findings revealed recovery is understood as an uncharted, timely and personal process of engaging and transcending pain. Perceived barriers to mental health recovery and the internal dynamics experienced within the process have been explored. Recovery in young adulthood involved the reclaiming of their active and purposeful life force. It acquires real-life relevance when applied to the social and cultural factors that provide meaning in life for young adults. What are the implications for practice? This research will impact how mental health nurses understand the catalytic effects of personal, social and cultural meaning of suffering in young adults' actualization of mental health recovery. Findings have significance for practice as the process of mental health recovery must not be presented as a clinical pathway, but understood as a personalized strategy of individual wellness in young adulthood. Introduction within their emerging adult role, young people will embark on employment, form intimate relationships and live independently. This indicates that how recovery is experienced and actualized in young adulthood may be different from other age groups. Aim/question to explore young adult service user's perspectives of mental health recovery in northern ireland. Method semi-structured individual qualitative interviews were analysed using a gadamerian-based hermeneutic method and interpreted using a novel theoretical framework. The sample comprised 25 participants with an average age of 28 years. Findings five key themes evolved: services: a losing battle straight away; from your foundations to a step in the dark; let go of the pain not the experience; surviving out of the ashes recovery; and needs to be more than a word. Discussion the main findings were that recovery involved the reclaiming of their active and purposeful life force. It is suggested that young adults have developed an explanatory model of ``use that stuff you wanna bury'' to transform an illness narrative to a wellness strategy. Implications for practice this research has implications for mental health nursing so the process of mental health recovery is not presented as a clinical pathway, but a personalized strategy of individual wellness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,EXPLANATORY MODELS;HERMENEUTICS;MENTAL HEALTH RECOVERY;NURSING;;QUALITATIVE RESEARCH;SERVICE USER PERSPECTIVES;SUFFERING;YOUNG ADULTS,,

Psychiatric training confronts one with ideas and experiences that may result in a major modification of ones weltanschauung. This occurs in conjunction with clinical experience which one trusts is a given situation for training in psychiatry. The skills one brings to the commencement of training include skills in recognizing medical illness gestalts, and personal and social skills in interacting with people. One of the unhelpful notions one may bring is that explanations exist for illness and behaviors and that medicine and science know how to ameliorate most physical and psychological dysfunctions. The notion of uncertainty is almost foreign to the anxious medical graduate who feels compelled to know in order to have passed examinations over the preceding six years. Exposure to psychiatry for the first time reveals the diversity of behaviors, both normal and abnormal, and the variety of explanatory models that exist to account for such phenomena. Behavior in clinical interviews at the commencement of training is based on social skills of listening, eagerness to be nice, self-consciousness of ones youth and inexperience and anxiety about challenging the patients ideas. Therapeutic skills develop gradually and must continue to evolve with accumulating experience and maturity.

However, little is known about their stability over time as a factor influencing long-term outcome. The aim of the study is to assess the stability over time of explanatory models of illness among people with schizophrenia. A modified version of the short explanatory model interview was used to elicit explanatory models with 8 participants from four ethnic groups on two occasions. The interviews took place approximately 1 year apart. The results stated that the concept and cause of illness along with treatment preferences tended to be inconsistent in all patients between the baseline and follow-up interview. On the other hand, perceived severity of illness and prognosis were more inclined to be consistent over time. The consistency in responses was partly a function of the question type. Open-ended questions were more likely to elicit less consistent responses than questions with implied choice responses. It was concluded that the lack of stability of explanatory models may be a feature of explanatory models or it may be a weakness of the method used. This instability may limit their usefulness in predicting long-term outcome.

The subjects of investigation are diverse as well: individuals beset by feelings, thoughts, or behaviors they cannot escape or control; social groups whose risk of impairment is unusually great; cultural groups differing in the expression of distress and social reactions it evokes; institutions whose business is counting, classifying, treading, and paying for mental illness; and the historically specific and local understandings we as sociologists have of these phenomena. In the previous chapter, linda george employed the principles of life course to unify several of these diverse themes. In this chapter, i use a similar but distinct concept, that of career, to achieve the same end. Whereas the life-course perspective addresses connections among the diverse trajectories comprising a person's life, such as family and work, the career perspective extracts one of these trajectories and accentuates its internal organization. In this instance, the trajectory of interest forms around the experience of unusual, unpleasant, unwanted, or unacceptable thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. I use the concept of career to fuse the social conditions that create such a state, mold the course it follows over time, shape its impact on the individual, and trigger consequences for those whose lives are interconnected. In many ways, this conceptual model reflects the organization of this handbook.

These deficits in awareness referred in general in the english literature as ""poor insight"", have been the focus of many clinical studies over recent years. This phenomenon, which is considered as fundamental in clinical evaluations of schizophrenia, should be understood as a multidimensional process rather than a dichotomic phenomenon, as is presently the case. The links between insight deficits and responses to vocational rehabilitation efforts represent a major interest in research, including those related to medication compliance and clinical outcome. To conduct such studies, various evaluation tools have been developed, enabling the assessment of insight, of its time-course and of its components in psychosis and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.; Literature findings: the scale to assess unawareness of illness in mental disorders (sumd) developed by amador and strauss appears to be the most frequently used scale for the evaluation of awareness of the disorder in schizophrenia. Although the model proposed by amador and strauss is considered as the privileged model in the multidimensional approach of insight, it corresponds only to a phenomenological analysis of this concept. In the second part of this article, we thus review the current models attempting to explain the lack of insight in schizophrenia. Four current explanatory models of lack of insight will be described as follows: resulting either from adaptation or defence mechanisms to environmental stressors, resulting from cognitive bias of data processing, resulting from neuropsychological functional deficits and resulting from metacognitive deficits.; Discussion: several hypotheses concerning these deficits arise from clinical studies. Although coping, and defence mechanisms to the consequences and stigmatization of the disease were hardly studied, the fact that poor insight does not appear related to the severity of symptomatology or to the emotional state of the patients argue against this hypothesis. Conversely, a considerable body of literature emphasized how unawareness may result from cognitive deficits. Research in neuropsychology and cognitive psychology has provided consistent results concerning the link between deficit in executive functions, frontal lobe dysfunction and poor insight. Recent studies on bias in cognitive information treatment and social cognition theories currently open new prospects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Ian""=>""Included""}",,AWARENESS*;SCHIZOPHRENIC PSYCHOLOGY*;SICK ROLE*;SCHIZOPHRENIA/*DIAGNOSIS;ADAPTATION;PSYCHOLOGICAL;ATTENTION;DEFENSE MECHANISMS;HUMANS;PERSONAL CONSTRUCT THEORY;PROGNOSIS;PSYCHIATRIC STATUS RATING SCALES;PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;REHABILITATION;VOCATIONAL;SCHIZOPHRENIA/REHABILITATION;STRESS;PSYCHOLOGICAL/COMPLICATIONS;Schizophrenia,,

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) studies revealed the link between the glutamate concentration in the acc and alterations in attentional scope. Hence, we investigated whether glutamate concentration in the dacc modulates brain response during salience processing. Methods: twenty-seven healthy subjects (12 , 15 ) provided both steam mrs at 7t measuring glutamate concentrations in the dacc as well as a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) task to study the influence on content-related salience processing and expectedness. Salience was modulated for both sexual and non-sexual emotional photos in either expected or unexpected situations. Correlation between mrs and task fmri was investigated by performing regression analyses controlling for age, gender, and gray matter partial volume. Results/conclusion: during picture processing, the extent of deactivation in the posterior cingulate cortex (pcc) was attenuated by two different salience attributions: sexual content and unexpectedness of emotional content. Our results indicate that stimulus inherent salience induces an attenuation of the deactivation in pcc, which is in turn balanced by higher level of glutamate in the dacc.

Mental health professionals (mhp) are considered to be one of the main sources of stigmatization. Objectives: : to identify the characteristics of mhp stigma in schizophrenia in comparison with other psychiatric disorders, the specificities of mhp compared with other social groups, and associated factors. Methods: : following prisma guidelines, we systematically searched multiple electronic databases for articles: (i) reporting original data published in english in peer-reviewed journals, (ii) reporting quantitative data with statistical analysis, (iii) assessing stigma in a broad sense, and (iv) including samples composed only of mhp. Results: : a total of 38 articles published from 1999 to 2019 and involving 10,926 mhp fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Studies showed that schizophrenia is the most stigmatized mental illnesses in mhp, despite recent results suggesting that borderline personality disorder and substance abuse may be more stigmatized. In comparison with other social groups, mhp reported less dangerousness beliefs and more positive beliefs regarding pharmacological treatment. Nevertheless, results were less consistent regarding prognosis and desire for social distance. Age, education level, type of mental health profession, or length of practice were associated factors that showed inconsistent relations with stigma. Work setting and biological causal beliefs were more clearly associated with mhp stigma. Conclusion: : these findings provide strong support for the need to conduct specific research on schizophrenia stigma in mhp and the importance of controlling for several variables to identify predictors of stigma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,STIGMA;SCHIZOPHRENIA;MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS;SYSTEMATIC REVIEW;Schizophrenia,,

The evidence favouring physical activity as a treatment for mild-to-moderate depression is extensive and relatively uncontested. It is unclear, however, how to increase an uptake of physical activity amongst individuals experiencing mild-to-moderate depression. This leaves professionals with no guidance on how to help people experiencing mild-to-moderate depression to take up physical activity. The purpose of this study was to scope the evidence on interventions to increase the uptake of physical activity amongst individuals experiencing mild-to-moderate depression, and to develop a model of the mechanisms by which they are hypothesised to work. Methods: a scoping study was designed to include a review of primary studies, grey literature and six consultation exercises; two with individuals with experience of depression, two pre-project consultations with physical activity, mental health and literature review experts, one with public health experts, and one with community engagement experts. Results: ten papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Consultation exercises provided insights into the mechanisms of an uptake of physical activity amongst individuals experiencing mild-to-moderate depression; evidence concerning those mechanisms is (a) fragmented in terms of design and purpose; (b) of varied quality; (c) rarely explicit about the mechanisms through which the interventions are thought to work. Physical, environmental and social factors that may represent mediating variables in the uptake of physical activity amongst people experiencing mild-to-moderate depression are largely absent from studies. Conclusions: an explanatory model was developed. This represents mild-to-moderate depression as interfering with (a) the motivation to take part in physical activity and (b) the volition that it is required to take part in physical activity. Therefore, both motivational and volitional elements are important in any intervention to increase physical activity in people with mild-to-moderate depression. Furthermore, mild-to-moderate depression-specific factors need to be tackled in any physical activity initiative, via psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy. We argue that the social and environmental contexts of interventions also need attention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Motor Activity;Intervention Studies,,

Evidence from general population studies challenge some assumptions, suggesting that measurement difficulties might relate to the characteristics of mental health samples, rather than measurement itself. This paper assesses the impact of mental illness on qol and its measurement, examining whether the life-conditions, opportunities and qol of different mental health-status groups vary, and if explanatory models of domain-specific and global qol differ. Objective life-conditions, access to life-opportunities and subjective qol were assessed over 2 years, using the same methodology in severe mental illness (smi; n = 149 (baseline)/n = 126 (follow-up)), common mental disorder (cmd; n = 794/354) and no disorder (n = 1119/583) groups. Objective life-conditions were worse in the smi group than in mentally healthy population and cmd groups, but the opportunities available to the smi group were no more restricted than the cmd group. Subjective qol ratings reflected this; smi group scores were lower than the healthy population and in some life-domains the cmd group. Models of qol suggested that life-quality was explained differently in the three groups. Qol studies combining mental health samples should control for health-status group, and domain-specific and global indicators of lifestyle and opportunity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,HEALTH STATUS INDICATORS*;LIFE STYLE*;MENTAL DISORDERS/*PSYCHOLOGY;ADULT;FEMALE;HUMANS;MALE;QUALITY OF LIFE;Quality of Life;Mental Disorders;Mentally Ill Persons,,

Comorbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux, arrhythmia, musculoskeletal disorders and cancer affect the quality of life of copd patients. Psychological factors, such as disease perception, active coping with the disease, anxiety and depression may also affect daily activities and quality of life. Methods: this cross-sectional study surveyed 86 patients from rural sichuan in china who had grade 1-3 copd based on the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease scale in order to clarify the relationship of psychological factors with daily activities and quality of life. Respondents filled out the following questionnaires: the brief illness perception questionnaire (as an assessment of disease perception), utrecht proactive coping competence questionnaire (active coping), the hospital anxiety depression scale (anxiety and depression), the modified medical research council scale (dyspnea), the functional performance inventory-short form (daily activities) and the clinical copd questionnaire (quality of life). Linear regression was used to explore potential relationship of these psychological factors with daily activities and quality of life. Results: active coping (beta=-0.696, p<0.001) was related to less restricted daily activities, and better quality of life was associated with better disease perception (beta=0.680, p<0.001) and lower anxiety (beta=0.479, p<0.001).

Factor analysis of each of the three parts of the questionnaire yielded a clearly interpretable structure, the british were more concerned with the rights of schizophrenics and believed them to be less dangerous and abnormal than did the japanese.

At the same time, clinical psychologists have demonstrated the importance of cognitive processes in the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of a wide variety of psychological problems. In this book, lyn abramson and her colleagues synthesize these exciting developments in social/personality and clinical psychology. Such a synthesis, they show, facilitates application of basic work to the clinical domain and permits the study of clinical phenomena to enrich social psychology. The first chapter delineates the relevance of biases in causal attribution to a variety of clinical phenomena, showing how errors in information processing contribute to the cause and/or maintenance of such psychological disorders as paranoia, anxiety, and depression. Chapters two through six examine psychological health and maladjustment from the social/cognitive perspective, while concluding chapters critique psychotherapy in the same light. An invaluable resource for clinical and experimental psychologists alike, 'social cognition and clinical psychology' is an expansive yet highly critical work that raises new questions about the cognitive mechanisms of psychological distress and the heuristics that inform its treatment.

To inform psychoeducational approaches for adhd, this study describes parent and adolescent knowledge, perceptions, and information sources and explores how these vary by sociodemographic characteristics, adhd risk, and past child mental health service use.; Methods: parents and adolescents were assessed 7.7 years after initial school district screening for adhd risk. The study sample included 374 adolescents (56% high and 44% low adhd risk) aged, on average, 15.4 (standard deviation = 1.8) years, and 36% were african american. Survey questions assessed adhd knowledge, perceptions, and cues to action and elicited used and preferred information sources. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine potential independent predictors of adhd knowledge. Mcnemar tests compared information source utilization against preference.; Results: despite relatively high self-rated adhd familiarity, misperceptions among parents and adolescents were common, including a sugar etiology (25% and 27%, respectively) and medication overuse (85% and 67%, respectively). African american respondents expressed less adhd awareness and greater belief in sugar etiology than caucasians. Parents used a wide range of adhd information sources, whereas adolescents relied on social network members and teachers/school. However, parents and adolescents expressed similar strong preferences for the internet (49% and 51%, respectively) and doctor (40% and 27%, respectively) as adhd information sources.; Conclusions: culturally appropriate psychoeducational strategies are needed that combine doctor-provided adhd information with reputable internet sources. Despite time limitations during patient visits, both parents and teens place high priority on receiving information from their doctor. (Copyright © 2012 society for adolescent health and medicine.

Despite this, the number of users of cam is increasing (munoz \& lopera, 2014). The development of scientific competences and the capacity to understand scientific knowledge and judge the reliability of information are two objectives of the degrees in pre-school and primary school education. Natural science teaching has demonstrated that socio-scientific issues offer an interesting debate to learn concepts and develop critical thinking (kolsto, 2001; torres \& solves, 2012; zeidler, sadler, applebaum \& callahan, 2009). In order to approach cam as a socio-scientific issue in a future teaching proposal, we have studied the perceptions, attitudes and arguments of teacher training students in relation to these medicines and their use. We designed a research in two stages. First, a questionnaire including three open questions (meaning of cam, motivation to use them and the differences with conventional medicine) was carried out. 209 students with an average age of 27 years and mainly females (85\%) answered the questions. The second part of the research was done with four focus groups; we posed questions to the groups based on the cam health belief questionnaire (chbq) (lie \& boker, 2004). The results show that students are favourable to cam because these therapies deal with the emotional needs of the patient and their remedies are ``natural''. Students think that conventional doctors don't pay attention to emotions. Students consider cam as a remedy of illnesses as anxiety, depression and muscular problems caused by stress due to actual lifestyle. Other misconceptions we found are related to the role of scientific medicine in society and the word ``chemical'' as being synonymous to conventional drugs that cause undesirable secondary effects. We suggest the inclusion of cam in future teaching proposals as a socio-scientific issue to improve students' scientific literacy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES;SCIENTIFIC COMPETENCES;HEALTH;BELIEF QUESTIONNAIRE (CHBQ);TEACHER TRAINING STUDENTS;SOCIO-SCIENTIFIC;ISSUES;Complementary Therapies,,

Methods we searched medline, embase, cinahl, psycinfo, isi web of knowledge, isi proceedings, zetoc, biosis, lilacs, and medcarib from their inception to september, 2006, searched reference lists of studies selected for inclusion, and contacted experts. Studies were included if longitudinal and population based. 35 studies from 4804 references were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were done independently and in duplicate. Findings there was an increased risk of any psychotic outcome in individuals who had ever used cannabis (pooled adjusted odds ratio=1.41, 95\% cl 1.20-1.65). Findings were consistent with a dose-response effect, with greater risk in people who used cannabis most frequently (2.09, 1.54-2.84). Results of analyses restricted to studies of more clinically relevant psychotic disorders were similar. Depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety outcomes were examined separately. Findings for these outcomes were less consistent, and fewer attempts were made to address non-causal explanations, than for psychosis. A substantial confounding effect was present for both psychotic and affective outcomes. Interpretation the evidence is consistent with the view that cannabis increases risk of psychotic outcomes independently of confounding and transient intoxication effects, although evidence for affective outcomes is less strong. The uncertainty about whether cannabis causes psychosis is unlikely to be resolved by further longitudinal studies such as those reviewed here. However, we conclude that there is now sufficient evidence to warn young people that using cannabis could increase their risk of developing a psychotic illness later in life.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Cannabis,,

This study examines the attributions women make about the somatic and affective symptoms they experience during the menstrual cycle. Using a 30-day prospective design, women with and without panic disorder monitored physical and affective symptoms. Participants reported on severity of various symptoms and a primary cause for each symptom (menstrual cycle-related, panic/anxiety related, stress-related, health-related). Women with panic disorder reported more panic attacks during the premenstrual phase compared to other cycle phases. They also reported more severe affective and panic symptoms during the premenstrual phase compared to other phases, but did not significantly differ from the comparison group in menstrual symptom severity across the three cycle phases. Although women with panic disorder attributed more panic/anxiety-related causes for their symptoms across the menstrual cycle, they were able to discriminate between panic/anxiety causes and menstrual cycle-related causes. Women with panic disorder may benefit for therapy that focuses on their exacerbation of panic symptoms during the premenstrual phase.

How have we been informed recently about what eating disorders are? Throughout history, eating disorders have been present and theories about their nature have run the gamut. However, in looking at historical accounts one cannot help but notice the common thread concerning the temperament of those with anorexia nervosa or the underlying rationale for self-induced vomiting. The importance of cultural contributions is notable, particularly as they define what is important or valued for a given culture. Witztum and coworkers have posed the idea of eating disorders as idioms of distress. This intriguing idea postulates that people in different cultures express their anxiety in ways that reflect the meaning a culture gives to distress, and also that culture might dictate how people display their distress (witztum et al. 2008). Emerging epigenetic research is illuminating the process by which cultural realities may contribute to the environmental and emotional stressors, which in turn cause alterations in genetic expression. Ultimately, as research offers new information supplanting some of the theories that have tried to explain eating disorders, clinicians will gain a greater understanding of just what these disorders really are. As clinicians clarity evolves, people diagnosed with eating disorders will experience less discrimination and enjoy unbiased, fully informed, and effective treatment.

However, genetic contingency theory predicts that genetic attributions will lead to an increased desire for social distance only from persons with disorders who are perceived as dangerous. Purpose: to assess the interactive effect of diagnosis and attribution on social distance and actual helping decisions across disorders. Methods: undergraduate students (n = 149) were randomly assigned to read one of the six vignettes depicting a person affected by one of the three disorders (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression) with either a genetic or environmental causal attribution for disorder. Participants completed measures of perceived dangerousness, social distance, empathic concern, familiarity with mental illness, and actual helping decisions. Results: when provided with genetic attributions, participants desire for social distance was greater for targets with schizophrenia relative to targets with depression or bipolar disorder. This effect was mediated by perceived dangerousness. The indirect effect of diagnosis on helping decisions, through social distance, was significant within the genetic attribution condition. Conclusion: consistent with genetic contingency theory, genetic attributions for schizophrenia, but not affective disorders, lead to greater desire for social distance via greater perceived dangerousness. Further, results suggest that genetic attributions decrease the likelihood of helping people with schizophrenia, but have no effect on the likelihood of helping people with affective disorders. These effects are partially accounted for by desired social distance from people with schizophrenia.

The current study was designed to begin to look at this piece, by measuring the marital cognitions of wives whose husbands drink alcohol. More specifically, the present study was designed to determine whether wives' marital attributions for marital problems relate to husbands' level of drinking and marital satisfaction. Thirty community wives married to alcohol users completed measures of marital attributions for marital problem areas, marital satisfaction, and depression. The results support six of seven hypotheses. Wives' marital attributions of partner blame and globality were significantly associated with level of drinking even when controlling for depression. Wives' marital attributions of partner blame, stability, and globality were also significantly related to marital satisfaction when controlling for depression. Marital attribution of stability was not significantly correlated with partner's degree of drinking. Implications of these results are discussed and directions for further research are provided.

Evidence was found to support the hypothesis that groups varying in self-reported concern about the described event differed in the interpretations that they made while reading. Taken together, the results of the three experiments are consistent with the conclusion that non-anxious individuals infer positive outcomes to an ambiguous event, while highly anxious individuals do not. It is suggested that these results have implications for cognitive processes that could maintain anxiety in real life.

We describe alternative explanatory models of the relationship between mental disorders and suicide and their implications for prevention activities. For example, living with mental disorders leads to increased exposure to well-known and easily identified risk factors, suggesting the need for greater focus of prevention activities on improving the lives of persons with mental disorders. We challenge the simple conclusion that, because mental disorders and suicide may be highly associated, therefore treating mental disorders is the best suicide prevention strategy. We suggest that understanding why people with a mental disorder are at greater risk of suicide can help us to understand why only a minority of people with mental disorders complete suicide, as well as how to prevent suicide in persons with mental disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Suicide;Mentally Ill Persons,,

Using the experience sampling method and identical measures across sites, subjects were signaled five times daily for one week to provide reports of negative events, attributions, and depressed moods. Controlling for effects associated with gender and trait anxiety and depression, significant differences emerged between french and american samples concerning the average severity of daily negative events, depressed moods, and causal attributions. However, the relationships between these variables (the fundamental hypothesis of cognitive theory) was largely unaffected by sample source. The results underscore the importance of cultural factors for the experience of specific variables, but provide support for the generalizability of the theory's tenets across french and american populations.

Respondents also completed a questionnaire on causal beliefs and treatment preferences pertaining to mental disorders. Results indicated that beliefs and treatment preferences were affected by the index of social change (isc) and were specific to type of disorder. High isc teachers endorsed significantly higher ratings on belief in an internal cause for depression and dependent personality disorder, and indicated greater preference for participation in treatment than lower isc teachers. Contrary to prediction, lower isc teachers indicated a greater preference for greater individual goals in treatment for depression and schizophrenia. High isc teachers also reported greater perception of interpersonal control and emotional support, less dependency and less interpersonal sensitivity than lower isc teachers.

Method: in total, 175 couples who had a child with asd (512 years) completed measures about the child's positive behaviour, asd symptoms, functional skills and negative behaviour problems, and their own positive and negative affect and closeness in the parentchild relationship. A comparison group of 170 couples who had a child without a neurodevelopmental disability also completed measures. Results: dyadic multilevel models were conducted. Parents of children with asd believed that their child's positive behaviour was due to factors less internal to the child, less stable and less controllable by the child than the comparison group. Beliefs about stability were associated with closeness in the parentchild relationship. Child age and level of impairment and parent education were associated with parental attributions.

Methodology: 126 female survivors of childhood sexual abuse completed anonymous survey packages which included a modified version of the attributional style questionnaire, the trauma symptom checklist-40, and questions regarding demographics and abuse characteristics. Results: the study revealed that participants reporting abuse by an immediate fan-lily member and abuse before 10 years of age tended to report having made internal attributions of blame when they were children. In addition, reports of internal attributions of blame made during childhood were significantly predictive of overall adulthood symptomatology, as well as presence of suicide attempts.

In this study, it was hypothesized that fm patients, compared to healthy individuals, would be higher on trait measures of rep (defensiveness and alexithymia), and would show affective-autonomic response dissociation, that is, higher standardized scores of heart rate responses than affective responses, during negative emotional stimulation. Additionally, fm patients were expected to attribute their bodily symptoms more to somatic than to psychological causes.; Method: emotional movie excerpts were shown to 16 female fm patients and 17 healthy women. Affective response and heart rate were monitored continuously, while symptoms and their causal attributions were measured before and after the excerpts. Repressor coping style and alexithymia were measured, along with negative affectivity and habitual attributions of somatic complaints.; Results: fm patients nearly all showed the relatively uncommon combination of high defensiveness and high anxiousness. Compared with healthy women fm patients were more alexithymic, showed a higher level of affective-autonomic response dissociation, and lower within-subject emotional variability. The groups showed opposite attributional patterns, with fm patients attributing symptoms less to psychological causes and more to somatic causes. There was no evidence of a shift in these attributions caused by the emotional stimuli.; Conclusions: the results provide preliminary support for the hypotheses. Both at trait and at state level, fm showed restricted emotional processing on most of the parameters measured, and a high ratio of somatic to psychological symptom attribution, coupled with high negative affectivity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,AFFECT*;FIBROMYALGIA/*PSYCHOLOGY;SOMATOFORM DISORDERS/*PSYCHOLOGY;ADULT;AFFECTIVE SYMPTOMS/DIAGNOSIS;AFFECTIVE SYMPTOMS/EPIDEMIOLOGY;FEMALE;FIBROMYALGIA/DIAGNOSIS;FIBROMYALGIA/EPIDEMIOLOGY;HEART RATE/PHYSIOLOGY;HUMANS;MALE;MIDDLE AGED;REPRESSION;PSYCHOLOGY;SOMATOFORM DISORDERS/DIAGNOSIS;SOMATOFORM DISORDERS/EPIDEMIOLOGY;Fibromyalgia,,

The conceptual status of this variable remains uncertain, however. Cognitive, conditioning, pharmacological, and biological explanatory models of craving have been developed in recent years. In this article a metacognitive analysis of craving is outlined in which cravings are construed as metacognitions (i.e., statements about other cognitions). In a metacognitive analysis, craving for psychoactive substances is an indication that the individual is experiencing a cognitive event (i.e., thought, feeling, memory, image, sensation) that is aversive or unpleasant. Consumption of a psychoactive substance is a means of self-regulating such cognitive events. Identifying the cognitive experience implicit in the expression of cravings can inform the clinician of the client's deficiencies in cognitive self-regulation and other coping skills.

However, little is known about attributions for discriminatory events and their relationship to psychosocial outcomes in sexual minority individuals. Relationships were examined between gay mens attributions for discrimination and their satisfaction with social support, a variable critical to mental health in this population. Gay men (n = 307) completed online measures of satisfaction with social support, attributions for discriminatory events, and key minority stress constructs. Self blaming attributions for discrimination were associated with decreased satisfaction with social support, independent of the frequency with which participants reported experiencing discrimination. The link between self blaming and satisfaction with social support was partially mediated by a latent affective construct comprised of anxiety, depression, and low positive affect. A moderation effect was also found, such that the relationship between frequency of perceived discriminatory events and dissatisfaction with social support was amplified for men reporting more blame toward perpetrators of discrimination. Results support attributions for discrimination as valuable additions to minority stress models. Assessing self and other blame for these discriminatory events may help to clarify pathways by which discrimination can undermine gay mens satisfaction with their social support networks.

Although there has been substantial research on the diagnosis, treatment and potential causes of depression in old age, few studies have examined how older adults themselves view the experience of depression within their 'everyday lives.' In addition, current narrative approaches to understanding depression are limited by narrow use of narrative forms (e.g., interviews) and interpretive frameworks. The overall goal study goal was to examine depression in older age as it conceptualized, experienced and articulated. Methods. Two groups of community dwelling adults age 69 and over were recruited. Group 1 comprised 21 adults (4 european american (ea) men, 8 ea women, 5 african american (aa) men and 4 aa women) adults who had a clinical diagnosis of depression or who scored >16 on the ces-d. Group 2 comprised 21 adults (9 ea men, 4 ea women, 3 aa men and 5 aa women) who were not diagnosed with depression and whose ces-d score was <16. Participants completed a demographic form, the ces-d, and an open-ended interview at time 1 and a follow-up interview at time 2, approximately two weeks after time 1. In addition, 22 participants (10 depressed, 12 non-depressed) completed an additional letter writing task following the time 1 interview. Results. Thematic analysis revealed that most participants felt ageism contributed to depression. Many participants in the depressed group attributed their depression to heredity, inability to drive, and/or loneliness. A common theme for depressed and non-depressed ea men was 'anger as depression' while for many women, children were a cause of depression. For aa men and women, racism was a significant issue. For some, surviving a lifetime of racism prevented current depression while for others, continued racism was a major cause of current depression. Conclusion. Overall, the study has provided important insight into how depression is perceived and defined by a group of older adults. Themes of anger and the role of children are areas in need of further investigation by clinicians and researchers.

One hundred and forty seven female participants between the ages of 18 and 54 (m = 23.84) completed this study; 87.8% of participants identified as caucasian. Six hypotheses were tested; the main hypothesis of interest assessed if causal and/or responsibility attribution style would mediate the relationship between csa and dysfunctional sexuality when controlling for covariates (substance use/psychopathology and emotion dysregulation). Results demonstrated that attribution style did not mediate the relationship between csa and dysfunctional sexuality; however, attribution style did account for significant portions of variance in predicting dysfunctional sexuality. For example, causal attribution style (a) significantly predicted internal sexual control (which was not predicted by csa and covariates), (b) accounted for a significant portion of variance in predicting sexual anxiety above/beyond csa and covariates, and (c) accounted for a significant portion of variance in predicting decreased sexual motivation with women reporting higher levels of csa. Responsibility attribution style significantly predicted internal sexual control (which was not significantly predicted by csa and covariates) and accounted for a significant portion of variance over/above csa and covariates in predicting sexual anxiety and sexual depression. Additionally, results demonstrated that substance use/psychopathology mediated the link between csa and dysfunctional sexuality, specifically sexual preoccupation, sexual anxiety, and sexual depression. Results suggest that female csa survivors who use substances, report psychological symptoms, and make maladaptive attributions for negative partner behaviors are at risk for negative outcomes regarding sexual behaviors and attitudes. Limitations include the self-report design of the study, as some participants noted that several items were confusing or ambiguous, the use of online sampling (e.g., missing data), and significant skewness/kurtosis of several study variables. Additionally, this study questioned participants on experiences that may have been aversive and/or distressing; thus, participants responses to these items may have been influenced due to the nature of the items.

It is suggested that the concept of ``system of explanation'' has advantages over, for example, ``illness narrative'' and ``explanatory model'' when demonstrating how some individuals engage in the creative analytic and theory-building work of bricolage, selecting, adding, and combining various systems of explanation.

Many are interested in beliefs about cause, manifestation and cure as well as the relationship between those beliefs. This study examines lay beliefs regarding the manifestations, aetiology and treatment of narcissistic personality disorder (npd), and their determinants using a questionnaire divided into three parts. Participants (n = 201) answered 45 attitudinal statements designed for this study regarding npd. They consisted of 18 manifestation items, 15 aetiology items and 12 treatment items referring to npd. They also completed the narcissistic personality inventory. Each section of the questionnaire was factor analysed to determine the structure of those beliefs. Factors derived from a principle component analysis of lay beliefs demonstrate poor knowledge of npd. Factors derived from the manifestations, aetiology and treatment section were modestly and coherently correlated. No demographic factors correlated with all aspects of mental health literacy and lay theories. People are surprisingly misinformed about npd. They believed that narcissists manifested superficiality and social problems, business abilities and fragility. No distinction was made between biological and psychological causes or genetics and early negative events. Inability to identify npd may account for many reports of sub-clinical narcissism being associated with leadership derailment.

Two of these studies also explored the effect of expectancy violation on the social information processing of individuals high and low in causal uncertainty. Participants with high and low causal uncertainty were exposed to five hypothetical outcomes that either violated or confirmed expectancies, and then were asked to observe an actor's behavior and to form an impression of the actor they observed. Consistent with predictions, the current research provided evidence that expectancy violation can activate temporarily causal uncertainty feelings, and that this activation was especially likely to occur for chronically accessible causal uncertainty feelings. Also consistent with predictions, the results of the current studies indicated that heightened feelings of causal uncertainty resulted in more systematic, complex attributional processing, especially for participants high in causal uncertainty. Importantly, it appears that the effects of causal uncertainty on social information processing might account for the effects of depression on social information processing that previously have been found in the literature on the social-cognitive consequences of depression. In the current studies, depression levels had no explanatory power to account for the effects on the social information processing measures, above and beyond that of causal uncertainty. Potential reasons for the different styles of social information processing adopted by participants high and low in causal uncertainty are discussed. Methodological considerations and implications for future research also are discussed.

In this study, we examined aspects of gender role socialization (gender-related traits, socially desirable responding, beliefs about mental health and depression) that may contribute to a response bias in self-reports of depression. In addition, we investigated the impact of two contextual variables (i.e., cause of depression and level of intrusiveness of experimental follow-up) on self-reports of depressive symptoms. Results indicated that men, but not women, reported fewer depressive symptoms when consent forms indicated that a more involved follow-up might occur. Further, results indicated differential responding by men and women on measures of gender-related traits, mental health beliefs, and beliefs about depression and predictors of depressed mood. Together, our results support the assertion that, in specific contexts, a response bias explanation warrants further consideration in investigations of gender differences in rates of self-reported depression.

The groups were compared on self-report measures of risk perception, bodily vigilance, illness perceptions the type of causal attributions (somatic, normalizing and psychological) generated for congruent and incongruent types of anxiety-related bodily sensations (cardiac, respiratory, gastro-intestinal and cognitive dyscontrol). Anxious, compared to non-anxious, mi participants perceived themselves to be at higher risk of a further mi, had higher levels of bodily vigilance and more negative emotional and cognitive representations of their mi. Anxious participants generated significantly more somatic attributions and fewer normalizing attributions, than non-anxious participants for cardiac sensations. There was also a trend for anxious participants to generate this pattern of attributions for respiratory items.

Few studies have considered practical barriers and controlled for individual difference factors. Objective: to clarify depression treatment preferences among japanese undergraduates while considering practical barriers and controlling for individual difference factors. Methods: this was a cross-sectional study of 985 undergraduates. Depression treatment preferences were assessed by presenting them with nine hypothetical clinics. Conjoint analysis was performed using a random effect ordered probit model, controlling for the effects of gender, age, department, lifetime use of healthcare services, perceived etiology of depression, stigma towards depression, transportation time, opening hours, and treatment options. Results: transportation time and treatment options had the greatest average discrete changes than other factors. Although information is presented about treatment costs in the order medication (3,000 yen), psychotherapy (7,000 yen) and combination (10,000 yen), the order of predicted probabilities for positive ratings was combination (61.4\%), psychotherapy (54.9\%) and medication (23.2\%). Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. Conclusion: transportation time and treatment options have greater utility than other factors, and a combination of psychotherapy and medication is the most preferred treatment option despite having the highest treatment costs. Efforts to overcome these effects could help increase depression treatment preferences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,ADHERENCE;ATTITUDES;DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENTS;HELP SEEKING;MENTAL;HEALTH LITERACY;Depression,,

Factor analysis revealed four causal factors, common to both conditions, labeled as religious factors, physical factors, coping style and social/environmental stressors. Furthermore, four treatment factors emerged: religious means, professional help, help from others (non-professional) and self-initiated means. Explanatory variables for these beliefs were assessed using: a religious beliefs inventory (rbi) to measure religious beliefs; a values survey (vs) including a measure of christian religious values; and a religion and mental health inventory (rmhi) to measure cognitive dissonance (cf. Festinger, 1957) between religious faith and perceptions of mental-health principles. The results revealed that religious beliefs, religious values and cognitive dissonance function as predictors of the attribution of the causes and treatments, for major depression and schizophrenia, to religious factors. An additional finding of this study was that 38.2% of the participants endorsed a demonic aetiology of major depression, and 37.4% of the participants endorsed a demonic aetiology of schizophrenia.

The disease affects how the body breaks down food into energy. It is an insulin-deficient disease and causes heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease. Investigators of the centers for disease control and prevention and the american diabetes association evaluated patient treatment preferences to determine the upsurge in patient health-related quality of life (hrqol) and optimum health. The literature revealed that patients' preferences consisted of therapies and achievable goal setting using the health belief model (hbm) framework. This quantitative research aimed to predict therapies in diabetes management measured by promis 25 (instrument) for patients with type 2 diabetes. The generated data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (spss, version 24) t test, ancova for significant differences in therapy groups with statistical significance set at p < 0.05, multivariate logistic regression analysis, spearman's correlation for the strength and direction of monotonic association between two variables, and possible bivariate analysis to examine associations of concomitant factors.

Its assumptions continue to be challenged, especially by psychiatrists with a biologic-scientific orientation. Hence it is an appropriate model for examining the transitional area between textbook medicine and what are referred to as ""alternative"" treatment approaches. The historical development of psychiatry from the end of the 18th century was characterized on the one hand by the increasing influence of biological and technical methods of investigation and on the other by the increasing independence of the citizenry and societal acceptance of subjective emotional experience. The special contribution of freudian psychoanalytic theory lies in its function as a medicator between these two approaches, whereby it develops analogies between the scientific knowledge of the time and psychic processes. At the same time it provides explanations of emotional illness that the individual can comprehend. This is what is unique about classical psychoanalysis and at the same time makes it problematic, as evidenced, for example, by the fact that so many different schools have developed. The integration of psychoanalysis in the form of psychoanalytic psychotherapy into textbook medicine gives the latter the advantage of being able to reach a clientele that in addition to wanting scientific-causal explanations also has a desire for existential interpretations of psychopathological states.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES*;PSYCHOANALYTIC THERAPY*/EDUCATION;MENTAL DISORDERS/*THERAPY;CURRICULUM;EDUCATION;MEDICAL;FREUDIAN THEORY;HUMANS;MENTAL DISORDERS/PSYCHOLOGY;TREATMENT OUTCOME;Psychotherapy,,

Evidence from causal attribution theory and attribution studies in other medical conditions led to the hypothesis that parents who make internal attributions (self-blame) will have poorer psychological wellbeing. Design: a cross-sectional survey. Setting: postal questionnaires were sent to parents of children under the care of the south thames cleft service at guy's hospital. Participants: participants were recruited if they had a baby between 12 and 24 months old with a cleft lip and/or palate. Of 204 parents, 42 responded. Main outcome measures: a semistructured questionnaire about causal beliefs was completed alongside validated questionnaires measuring anxiety, depression (hospital anxiety and depression scale), and perceived stress (perceived stress scale). Results: causal attributions were grouped according to type (environmental, chance, self-blame, and no belief) and loci (external or internal). The most common attribution made was to external factors (54.4\%), followed by no causal attribution (38.1\%). Parents making an internal (self-blaming) attribution (16.7\%) had significantly (p < .05) higher scores on the hospital anxiety and depression scale anxiety measure (r = .32) and perceived stress scale (r = .33), but not on the hospital anxiety and depression scale depression measure (p = .283). Conclusions: the high number of parents making an external attribution can be explained by causal attribution theory. However, the percentage of parents making no causal attribution was higher than seen in previous research. Surprisingly, no parents blamed others. The main hypothesis was tentatively accepted because there were significantly higher anxiety and stress scores in parents who self-blamed; although, depression scores were not significantly higher.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Ian""=>[""No focus on a specific mental illness/disorder""]}",,CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS;CAUSAL BELIEFS;CLEFT LIP AND/OR PALATE;PARENTS;;PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING,,

In this system, encounters between physicians and patients become processes of negotiating explanatory models, such as when patients expect to receive medication because they believe that any severe emotional suffering and absence of energy that continues to limit their daily functioning is a medical problem.

The influence of laminar structure on reservoir quality is examined using a combination of geochemistry, mineralogy, and pore structures. Explanatory models are established. Three types of laminar units are distinguished in the study area based on differences in pore structure. These are clay mineral laminae (ua), clay mineral-ostracod laminae (ub), and clay mineral-felsic laminae (uc). Ua has illite intergranular pores, micro-fractures, and organic pores, with diameters of 0.5 similar to 2 mu m. Ub primarily contains ostracod shell margin fractures, pyrite intergranular pores, and chlorite intragranular pores. Uc contains albite and illite intergranular pores. Nitrogen adsorption tests show that ua has the highest clay content and the best specific pore volume and specific surface area, indicating that clay minerals are the main contributors to the pores in this type of unit. 2d-3d models of different laminae reveal that carbonate cement is widely developed in ub and uc, but dissolution pores are less developed, with the result that the porosity of ua is two to three times greater than that of ub or uc. It appears that intergranular pores and fractures, formed during the transformation of clay minerals during the advanced thermal evolution stage, are the main contributors to storage space and flow channels. Thermal evolution, clay mineral transformation, and carbonate cementation are the key factors causing differences between laminar units. In addition, clay mineral laminae (ua) are the most important laminar units for shale oil enrichment in the study area. This finding is of great significance for accurately predicting the distribution of shale ``sweet spots'' and guiding shale oil and gas exploration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,SHALE OIL AND GAS;SUB-MILLIMETER-SCALE EVALUATION;RESERVOIR PROPERTY;;LAMINAR PATTERN,,

Male and female inpatients in chemical dependency treatment at a central states regional public accredited psychiatric facility were administered the real events attributional style questionnaire (reasq), the depression adjective check list-form e (dacl-e; trait form), general hardiness test (pvs-personal views survey), and the effectiveness of coping behaviours inventory-adapted (ecbi-adapted). Routine nursing observations of participants' coping behaviors were summarized. These hypotheses were posed: (1) a positive relationship would exist between hardiness and attributional style. (2) hardiness and attributional style would positively relate to effective coping. (3) depression would negatively relate to effective coping. (4) women would have a more negative attributional style than men; would be less hardy and more depressed than men; and would rate themselves as coping more effectively than men on the social support dimension of the ecbi. A negative relationship was found among internal/external, composite attributional style, challenge, commitment, hardiness, income, education, and observed coping. There was partial support that women in the study were more depressed than men. The women displayed a partially more negative attributional style than men, scoring higher on the global dimension and tending to universalize negative explanations. In addition, women tended to score higher in challenge than men and to self-rate coping with urges to use drugs or drink as effective. However, observers were less likely to rate women as coping positively. Positive attributional style and challenge were the best predictors of effective coping (observed and self-rated) for the participants.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect on the prevalence rate of depression and anxiety in a nursing home population of attributing somatic symptoms of depression and anxiety to either somatic or psychiatric disorder. Symptoms of major depression (md), generalized anxiety disorder (gad) and panic disorder (pd) were measured using the schedules for clinical assessment in neuropsychiatry (scan). Somatic symptoms of md, gad and pd were attributed to somatic causes when the interviewer was not sure about a psychiatric cause. To analyse the effect of this attribution on the prevalence rate of md, gad and pd, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken in which symptoms that were attributed to somatic causes were recoded as symptoms attributed to psychiatric disorder. Prevalence rates of md, gad and pd were calculated before and after receding. The prevalence of md after receding rose from 7.5% to 8.1%. The prevalence of gad did not change. The prevalence of pd rose from 1.5% to 1.8%.

Assessments In Structured Clinical Interviews,2018,1,1,THE JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY: INTERDISCIPLINARY AND APPLIED,,,,,JENKINS MR and KIM NS,,,,,"When causal life-event explanations for disorder symptoms are available, clinicians tend to explain away those symptoms (ahn, novick, & kim, 2003; meehl, 1973), eschewing formal diagnostic guidelines such as the dsm-5 (american psychiatric association, 2013). We asked whether this effect is attenuated in the context of a structured diagnostic clinical interview procedure, which deliberately directs evaluators' attention to symptoms alone, or whether it is robust enough to continue to emerge. Across two experiments, lay evaluators given causal life-event explanations for disordered behaviors gave them lower judgments of abnormality and need for treatment compared to evaluators not given such explanations, regardless of whether they used a structured clinical interview. Thus, causal life-event explanations may have significant impact on clinical evaluations regardless of the mode of assessment. Implications for the clinical utility of structured interviews and the role of life-event context in diagnosis and classification are discussed.

Little research has been conducted on relations between challenging working and living conditions and psychological distress in latino migrant day laborers (lmdls), a particularly marginalized latino population in the united states. Aims . Consistent with a structural-environmental framework of lmdl vulnerability to health and mental health problems, this study tests a model of hypothesized pathways between working and living conditions and multiple forms of psychological distress. Method . Structural equation modeling was used to test the conceptual model with 344 lmdls who participated in a cross-sectional survey in the san francisco bay area. Results . As hypothesized, results reveal pathways between (1) working and living conditions; (2) working and living conditions and depression, as well as desesperación (desperation), the latter a latino cultural idiom of distress frequently expressed by lmdls; and (3) between living conditions and alcohol use.

Barriers to accessing pmh services include the stigma, non-availability of services, poor knowledge, negative perception, attitude among perinatal women (pws) and service providers. The present study attempted to examine the knowledge gap regarding perinatal depression (pd) among service providers [nursing providers (nps), medical practitioners (mps)] and service utilizers (pws). Methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted in two tertiary care teaching hospitals of india, one in a major metro and the other in a rural area. Pws, mps and nps were assessed for knowledge about pd using a semi-structured proforma and perinatal depression monitor. Results: among the 270 pws, 8.51% were knowledgeable (pwa) and 91.49% were ignorant (pwb) about depression. Pwb group were low educated (n = 140, 56.68%), and unemployed (n = 207, 83.80%) with lower family income [(=10,356 per month), n = 170, 68.28%)]. There was knowledge discrepancy among nps, mps and pwa group in terms of a) pd is a normal part of pregnancy (agree- nps = 71.52%, mps = 10.00%, pwa-17.39%), b)biological causes of pd (agree- nps = 45.23%, mps = 70.00%, pwa = 26.03%) and c)antidepressant medications for pd (useful- nps = 23.80%, mps = 70.00%, pwa = 21.73%). Majority of the respondents agreed that all women should be screened for depression during pregnancy (nps = 34.78%, mps = 80.95%, pwa = 95.00%) and postpartum periods (nps = 34.78%, mps = 76.19%, pwa = 90.00%). Conclusions: low pd literacy among the pws, misconception about aetiology and management among the nps could be major barrier for delivery and utilisation of pd services. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve pd literacy among pws and nps.

Most did not have any formal training during medical school on treating obese patients and three-quarters evaluated their training in psychiatric residency programs on weight loss/control issues as ""not adequate at all"" or ""not very adequate."" The majority regularly assisted their obese patients with weight management. Most psychiatrists felt confident to ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange (5as) regarding weight loss issues and believed that doing so would result in significant weight loss. The majority were more likely to advise obese patients to lose weight when comorbid conditions were present. The most common barriers to aiding obese patients were time constraints, poor patient compliance, lack of clear guidelines and practice tools, limited medical training on the issue, and fear of offending patients.; Conclusion: patients can no longer afford to have their psychiatrists provide cursory assistance with obesity.

Depression and alcoholism likely exist in greater proportions of physicians than in other segments of the working population, but at rates similar to those experienced by other kinds of health care workers; these health problems are often long-standing. Physicians generally look after themselves very badly in terms of seeking help. Ramifications of poor health include poor decision-making, memory and concentration deficits, selective attention, irritability, and interpersonal difficulties. The most common and strongly perceived causes of stress at work are high work demands and overload. It is likely that stress plays a role in the risk of medical accidents.

The study investigated the lived experiences of adults over 30 years old living with sickle cell disorder (scd) and sought to develop a model understanding participants' ability to function. Design. Over a period of 10 months, in-depth individual interviews were held with nine participants and three focus groups were held with six further participants. Methods. Grounded theory, a qualitative methodology, was chosen to explore functioning across domains of experience in order to build an explanatory model. Results. Physical, psychological, and social functioning were adversely effected by scd. Access to and quality of resources including friends, family, and finances formed the context in which participants attempted to manage the disorder. Management of scd improved over time as participants moved to acceptance of the condition. This allowed participants to strengthen their resilience by creating meaning, developing their identity, and actively coping with the effects of scd, thus improving their ability to function and to appreciate life. Conclusions. The study demonstrates the considerable resilience of people over 30 with scd, providing a positive and hopeful model which can be utilized clinically to support the functioning of people with scd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,"NA;Anemia, Sickle Cell",,

The aim of this study was to measure public stigma against pwmi and the factors associated with stigma in the gilgel gibe field research center (ggfrc) in southwest ethiopia. Methods: this community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from june to august 2012 among 845 randomly selected respondents by using the community attitudes towards the mentally iii (cami) scale, an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data was entered with epi-data and then exported to stata for analysis. Simple descriptive and linear regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of stigma against pwmi. Results: of the total of 845 respondents, 68.17\% were from rural districts. The mean stigma score was 2.62 on a 5-point score. The majority of the respondents (75.27\%) believed that mental illness can be cured. Stress, poverty, and rumination were the most often perceived causes of mental illness. Rural residents had significantly higher stigma scores (std. Beta = 0.61, p<0.001). A statistically significant inverse relationship was found between the level of education and degree of stigma (std. Beta = -0.14, p<0.01), while higher income was significantly associated with more stigma (std. Beta = 0.07, p<0.05). Respondents with higher scores for perceived supernatural causes (std. Beta = -0.09, p<0.01) and perceived psychosocial and biological causes (std. Beta = -0.14, p< 0.001) had significantly lower stigma levels. Conclusions: the study found a more undermining but less avoidant attitude towards pwmi. Rural residents showed higher levels of stigma. Stigma against pwmi was lower in people with an explanatory concept about the causes of mental illness and a higher level of education. Information, education, and communication about the causes, signs, and nature of mental illnesses would help to reduce stigma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Mentally Ill Persons,,

Previously proposed adherence models have not been sufficiently accurate in identifying patients who do not adhere to treatment. This study evaluated the importance of the social context in adherence by using a prospective, longitudinal analysis. Specifically, this study evaluated the effects of caregivers' causal beliefs about depression and their perceptions of stigma on three-month treatment adherence among patients with depression. Methods: fifty patients with major depressive disorder and their primary caregivers were identified at a psychiatric hospital's outpatient clinic. Attributions for the causes of depression ( either cognitive and attitudinal or medical and biological) and perceived stigma were assessed among caregivers at baseline, and patients' adherence was evaluated three-months after treatment began. Results: data were available for 47 patients at follow-up. Caregivers' attribution of depression to cognitive and attitudinal problems significantly predicted patients' decreased adherence. However, the degree of patients' adherence was not predicted by caregivers' attributions to medical and biological causes and caregivers' perceived stigma. Conclusions: the findings stress the importance of patients' social environment in determining treatment adherence and the necessity of educating caregivers about the impact that their causal attributions have on patients' behavior. Involving caregivers in treatment may improve their attitude toward patients with depression and, in doing so, enhance patients' adherence and outcome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Cultures determine cognitive schema and also how individuals express and deal with distresswhether it is physical or emotional. Cultures determine explanatory models of illness that individuals hold and allocate health resources as well as encourage individuals to follow certain pathways into care and accept or reject health care. Cultural variations in presentation of various psychiatric disorders have been studied, but not treatment responses as widely. It is inevitable that dietary habits, simultaneous use of alternative and complementary medicines and other factors such as pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics play a major role in acceptance of pharmaceutical agents and treatment outcomes across cultures.

Nevertheless, attributional bias, a social-cognitive subdomain, has not yet been studied in this population, despite its potential relationship with neuropsychiatric symptoms, and despite the possibility that deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, an effective treatment for disabling motor symptoms, worsens cognitive impairment. The present study therefore compared the attributional bias of patients with pd (stimulated and nonstimulated subgroups) with that of controls. It also explored the potential correlations between patients' attributional bias and their clinical scores. Methods: thirty-two patients with pd (12 stimulated and 20 nonstimulated) were recruited and matched with 32 healthy controls. Attributional bias was assessed using the ambiguous intentions hostility questionnaire, which yields three subscores: hostility bias, aggression bias, and blame. Depressive symptoms (hamilton rating scale for depression), paranoid thoughts (paranoia scale), global cognition (montreal cognitive assessment), and social functioning (social functioning questionnaire) were also assessed. Results: patients exhibited more hostile and aggressive biases than controls, especially in ambiguous situations. Stimulated patients had greater hostility and aggression biases and a higher blame score than controls in accidental situations. No significant differences were observed between stimulated and nonstimulated patients. Conclusion: to our knowledge, this is the first study to have assessed attributional bias in patients with pd and explored the impact of deep-brain stimulation on this particular subdomain of social cognition. Results suggest that patients exhibit attributional bias, and this impairment may be exacerbated in stimulated patients.

The main hypotheses were that the contextual program would have the greatest impact and that a match between participants' beliefs about depression and the model presented would moderate this effect. Seventy-four participants were randomized to the 3 programs and 12 participants served as a no-program control. The contextual and control programs reduced stigma significantly compared with the no-program control, whereas the biomedical program did not.

Two separate independent perspectives on schizophrenia will be analyzed and criticized in relation to this model. The first one from the works of henri grivois, inspired by the general anthropology of rené girard is therefore oriented toward the mimetic dimension of interactions. The critique will focus on the gratuitous reduction of imitation to the domain of bodily motor functions when a much wider understanding of the concept is needed. The second perspective, proposed by richard bentall et al., deals with the attributional style of paranoids and is therefore mainly cognitive. The critique will focus on the reductionist and solipsistic vision of a self unduly equated with self-esteem. I intend to show that their respective mimetic and attributional foci are both needed in order to have a better understanding of the delusional subject, for these two dimensions define the intersubjective space in which the self is built. As a matter of fact, the self is traditionally described as having two fundamental components, the me or object self and the i or agent self. But only the first one, the me, has been thoroughly investigated by the so-called 'social mirror' research tradition which originates in cooleys 'looking glass self' hypothesis. The 'i' has constantly eluded scientific investigation and has therefore been virtually ignored by psychologists in the twentieth century. Many researchers have even proposed abandoning it to the realm of philosophy. However, as soon as the social mirror metaphor is understood as the imitation of others attributions to the object self, we may conceive of the agentself as the product of these imitations of attributions along the causal dimension. The 'i', characterized by the feeling of being the first cause of ones own behavior, would therefore be of no less social origin than the 'me'. Attributions of intention, responsibility or causality made by others to the self, when mimetically interiorized, will feed the causal self, the 'i'. This unitary and psychological conception of self allows a new interpretation of some characteristic aspects of the onset of schizophrenia. The typical feeling of being a focus of attention of an entourage sometimes extended to the whole world can now appear as just the pathological version of the healthy 'centrality' of the self in the 'social mirror'. The question is: howdoes the bifurcation of the dynamics of self towards pathology happen? I hypothesize that if the causal attributions that normally 'feed' the self along the agency dimension are too scarce, this will lead the self schema to an 'abreaction' which consists of 'hallucinating' personal causal attributions in the minute attentions, attitudes and messages provided by anonymous public social interactions. All these signs, when perceived and delusionally interpreted, will help the subject maintain the vital feeling of being a 'cause' capable of 'effects' which characterizes animated beings as opposed to pawns. Hence, the fact that paranoids are prone to perceive others as having malevolent intentions towards them, far from being explained by bentalls hypothesissince a bad social self image doesnt improve self-esteemcan be interpreted as their longing for causal attributions.

A Community Sample,1998,1,1,JOURNAL OF WOMEN'S HEALTH,,,,,STEWART D and ABBEY S and MEANA M and BOYDELL KM,,,,,"Determined the major health concerns or problems of women and their personal attributions for the causes of their primary health concerns. A survey of women from the toronto area attending a women's health symposium was used. Completed questionnaires were returned by 153 attendees. Persistent fatigue was the primary and most commonly cited health concern. Fatigue was ranked 1st by 42 (27.5%) women and among the top 10 concerns by 123 (80.4%) women. Ss attributed their fatigue to a combination of home and outside work (63.4%), poor sleep (38.2%), lack of time for self (34.1%), lack of exercise (32.5%), financial worries (28.5%), relationship problems (22.0%), emotional causes (17.9%), care of ill family members (13.8%), lack of social or individual support (9.8%), poor physical health (8.9%), work in home or child care (3.3%), or gender bias/harassment (2.4%). Ss overwhelmingly endorsed social determinants as the cause of their persistent fatigue. Although depression and anxiety form the most robust associations with persistent fatigue in primary care and community studies, ss in this sample ranked these factors in 7th place in their attributions. Similarly, although physicians often assume physical causes for fatigue, women rank physical health low in their own attributions.

A national online survey of 541 us adults from the general population was conducted in november 2016 about knowledge and attitudes about homelessness and ptsd both in reference to the general population and the veteran population. Results found that participants reported more positive attitudes and endorsed more federal funding for homelessness and ptsd for veterans than other adults. Participants also reported greater safety concerns about ptsd among veterans than other adults. Among various background characteristics, only political identification with the republican party was consistently associated with attitudes in favor of veterans. The us public reports greater support for addressing homelessness and ptsd among veterans than other adults, supporting various government and private programs dedicated to veterans.

This study examined the relationships of acculturation levels, generational status, education, age, gender, having sought help for personal issues, knowing someone who has a mental illness, perceptions of mental illness, and willingness to seek psychological help among 292 vietnamese americans. Method. The sample was a convenience sample gathered throughout southern california from public places. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire composed of scales that measure: (1) acculturation levels and generational status (the suin-lew asian self-identity acculturation scale [sl-asia] developed by suinn, richard-figueroa, lew, & vigil [1987]); (2) attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help (the shortened version of the attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help scale [atspphs] developed by fischer and farina [1995]); and (3) perceptions of mental illness (opinions about mental illness [omi] developed by cohen & struening [1962]). Findings. The results indicated that acculturation levels, gender, age, generational status, education, personally knowing someone who has a mental illness, having sought help for personal issues, and various perceptions of mental illness did not predict willingness to seek professional psychological help among vietnamese americans. However, when the language variable was introduced, the results showed interaction between language and age, income, having sought help for personal issues, knowing someone who has a mental illness on acculturation and perceptions of mental illness regarding authoritarianism, benevolence, mental hygiene, social restrictiveness, and interpersonal etiology. Knowing someone who has mental illness affected attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help.

It has been well documented that a hostile attributional style of parents and hostile attributional style of children are associated with poor child outcomes. Therefore, the degree to which the combination of child and parent attributions predict child outcome better than each taken alone was also assessed. The first hypothesis was tested by calculating the correlation between parents' and children's global factors for social-information processing (sip) as well as each sip step separately. The second hypothesis was analyzed by utilizing hierarchical multiple regression in an autoregression model. The data did not support the idea that children learn their attributions or gist-like sip styles from their parents. Further, child and parent attributions/gist-like sip were not found to significantly and prospectively contribute to child antisocial behavior as found in previous research that tended to use less stringent measures and more extreme samples than that in the present study. Interestingly, though not hypothesized, the present findings suggest that child antisocial behavior may, in fact, precede attributions, contrary to the often unspoken presumption that attributions precede behavior.

Existing models cannot fully explain prime number identification for savants with weak arithmetical skills. The author shows that through the natural tendency of visual perception to be organized symmetrically, a distinction between prime and nonprime numbers can be made.

However, despite the advances in recognizing the behavioural and cognitive manifestations of adhd, there are currently many adults being diagnosed with adhd who went undiagnosed as children. This study investigated possible effects of not being identified with adhd until adulthood, specifically for women, using attribution theory as a model to make predictions. A total of 117 women with and without the symptoms of adhd, with ages ranging from 24 to 59, participated in this study. All participants were parents of at least one child with adhd. Home interviews were conducted consisting of questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and a forced-failure word search task. Results revealed that the women with adhd were more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, had a more external locus of control, had lower self-esteem, and engaged more in emotion-oriented and less in task-oriented coping strategies. They were also more likely to report dissatisfaction with their childhoods and feel more helpless to make changes as a child. Their attributions were more uncontrollable, stable, and global. Women with adhd made more internal, global, and stable attributions for their failure on the insolvable task compared with women without adhd. However, there were no group differences in frustration levels, number of words given-up on, and amount of time to find the solvable words. Attributions were not found to predict performance on the task. This study highlighted: (1) the importance of distinguishing between characterological and behavioural self-blame, (2) the increased risk for psychological problems with both adhd and an internal-uncontrollable attributional style, (3) the extensive feeling of helplessness women with unidentified adhd felt as children, and (4) possible contributors to emotional distress in women with adhd, including severity of symptoms, childhood environments, and attributional styles. There was strong evidence of the detrimental effect of having unidentified adhd as a child, indicating the need for earlier identification and intervention for people affected with this disorder.

Method: in 2002, a representative survey (n = 745) was conducted among the adult population of novosibirsk, using a fully structured interview that has been used in previous surveys in germany. Results: symptoms of schizophrenia were more frequently identified as an indication of mental disorder than were depressive symptoms. Psychosocial stress and biological influences were similarly frequently seen as the cause of schizophrenia, with the former prevailing among the respondents in the case of depressive symptoms. Psychotherapy was most frequently recommended as a treatment measure, also for schizophrenia. Presupposing that no treatment measures will be taken, respondents assessed the prognosis for both mental disorders negatively. Conversely, interviewees gave a positive treatment prognosis. Discussion: respondents from germany and novosibirsk showed similar beliefs, especially as regards the importance of biological influences and psychosocial stress and the assessment of psychotherapy as compared to psychopharmacology.

According to the hopelessness theory of depression, hopelessness mediates the association between attributional style and depression. The aetiological processes underpinning this influential theory remain unknown. The current study investigated genetic and environmental influences on hopelessness and its concurrent and longitudinal associations with attributional style and depression across adolescence and emerging adulthood. Furthermore, given high co-morbidity between depression and anxiety, the study investigated whether these maladaptive cognitions constitute transdiagnostic cognitive content common to both internalizing symptoms. Method: a total of 2619 twins/siblings reported attributional style (mean age 15 and 17 years), hopelessness (mean age 17 years), and depression and anxiety symptoms (mean age 17 and 20 years). Results: partial correlations revealed that attributional style and hopelessness were uniquely associated with depression but not anxiety symptoms. Hopelessness partially mediated the relationship between attributional style and depression. Hopelessness was moderately heritable (a = 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.280.47), with remaining variance accounted for by non-shared environmental influences. Independent pathway models indicated that a set of common genetic influences largely accounted for the association between attributional style, hopelessness and depression symptoms, both concurrently and across development. Conclusions: the results provide novel evidence that associations between attributional style, hopelessness and depression symptoms are largely due to shared genetic liability, suggesting developmentally stable biological pathways underpinning the hopelessness theory of depression. Both attributional style and hopelessness constituted unique cognitive content in depression. The results inform molecular genetics research and cognitive treatment approaches.

Recent research using individual task settings suggests that a major problem in schizophrenia is a dysfunctional theory of mind system leading to false mental state attributions. However, if a more low-level deficit to integrate own and others actions (action blindness) is present in schizophrenia is still unknown. Using a social simon task, we tested if schizophrenia patients have a deficit in self-other integration. Further, we tested for a possible genetic bias of this dysfunction by studying clinically unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. While schizophrenia patients showed no social simon effect, we found a reliable social simon effect in healthy participants and first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. Joint task performance differed statistically between patients and healthy controls. We did not find any differences in the size of the social simon effects of relatives and healthy controls. The present findings suggest that schizophrenia patients have severe problems with self-other integration, which may lead to problems in social interactions. Since first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients showed a reliable social simon effect, the evidence for a genetic bias of this social dysfunction in schizophrenia however is weak.

We investigated whether unstable self-esteem is a characteristic of bipolar disorder in remission. Methods: we compared 18 patients with dsm-iv bipolar disorder in remission, 16 patients with unipolar disorder in remission, and 19 healthy controls.

We also administered winters and neale's (j abnorm psychol 1985; 94: 282-290) implicit measure of attributional style. Results: whereas mean levels of self-esteem and affect were not abnormal in the remitted bipolar patients, the bipolar patients showed strong fluctuations in these processes. In common with the unipolar patients, they also showed a pessimistic attributional style on the pragmatic inference task (pit). Conclusions: instability of self-esteem and affect is present in bipolar patients, even when their symptoms are in remission, and has previously been found in people at genetic risk of the disorder.

Several socialization processes promote the development of relations that endorse or reject certain values or identities. Unfortunately, many of these relations arise from prejudiced values that generate negative attitudes such as stigmatization or discrimination toward some persons. According to psychosocial models, generation of stigma is a consequence of three aspects: lack of knowledge about the person's condition (ignorance); development of negative attitudes (prejudice) and a tendency to exclude or reject some individuals (discrimination). Particularly, in mental health problems, general public knowledge of severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia frequently develops in accordance to myths and misconceptions. For example, schizophrenics are commonly viewed as mad and incompetent individuals that produce fear and rejection. These erroneous conceptions originate from considering that they are incapable of controlling their acts, thus giving rise to aggressive, violent or dangerous conducts. Stigmatization impacts patients increasing depressive symptoms, anxiety and social withdrawal. Stigma also has a negative impact on diagnosis and treatment; timely diagnostic interventions and specialized treatments are frequently delayed in stigmatized individuals. Although it is reasonable to anticipate that stigmatization attitudes are more common among persons with low cultural levels, many studies have demonstrated that unfortunately this problem is also present in many health professionals, including those who work with the mentally ill. For these reasons different attempts hove developed to reduce stigma by means of mental health literacy interventions oriented to modify and eliminate misconceptions about mental patients and their illness. In this sense, mental health literacy is defined as any educational intervention aimed to increase recognition, management and prevention of mental illness. Many studies have demonstrated that this type of interventions have a positive impact in reducing negative attitudes toward patients, diminishing in consequence treatment gap. In accordance to this theoretical framework, the principal objective of this study was to evaluate in a group of female psychology students, their attitudes toward mental illness determining their perception of danger and aggressiveness in a schizophrenic patient. We hypothesized that perception of dangerousness and aggressiveness will correlate with more negative attitudes to mental illness. Additionally, we compared attitudes to severe mental illness according to other variables related to mental health literacy such as knowledge of etiology of illness and treatment options, among female student in their first half of their career and female student in their second half. We hypothesized that advanced student will have a higher level of mental health literacy and less negative attitudes to mental illness. Method a total of 110 female psychology students from a university in mexico city were included in the study. Group's mean age (+/- sd) was 21.6 (1.7) years (range 19-33 years). All subjects gave their consent to participate in a voluntary and anonymous manner. Sixty five students (59.1\%) were at the initial half-stage of their career (1st to 5th semester), and forty five (40.9\%) were at their last half-stage (6th to 10th semester). The study was approved by the institutional research and ethical committees (instituto nacional de psiquiatria ramon de la fuente), and by the university's authorities. The opinions about mental illness scale (omi), previously translated and standardized in our country (omi-m), was used to evaluate personal attitudes toward severe mentally ill persons. Omi-m is a 34-item self-report questionnaire which evaluates attitudes utilizing a 5-points liker scale procedure (1 = totally disagree; 5=totally agree). Evaluation includes six factors: 1. Separatism, which emphasizes the persons' perceived differences about a mental disorder and the desire of keeping a distance to be safe; 2. Stereotyping, defined as conceiving mentally ill persons in accordance to certain behavioral and intellectual patterns; 3. Restrictiveness, which includes items that uphold an uncertain notion regarding the rights of mentally ill persons; 4. Benevolence, which evaluates compassion to the mentally ill; 5. Pessimistic prediction, referring to the perception that mentally ill persons are incapable of improving on their symptoms and how society is also not optimistic in this respect; 6. Stigmatization, build upon items that perceive mental illness as a cause of shame. The public aggressiveness concept questionnaire, a self-rated instrument was also applied in the study. This questionnaire evaluates the perception of aggressiveness after reviewing a standardized clinical vignette of a patient with an active paranoid schizophrenia. The reviewer is asked to answer questions regarding the identification of aggressive conduct in the vignette, including the presence and intensity of verbal and physical violence. In another section, the way symptoms could be controlled is evaluated. Additional questions are included in the final section of the questionnaire aimed to evaluate concepts such as if the reviewer considers that the person in the vignette has a mental illness, what causes might originate this condition, and if he or she perceives the subject as socially dangerous. Data analysis was carried utilizing the spss, version 17.0, statistical program. Categorical variables description was done with rates and percentages; continuous variables were analyzed with means and standard deviation. Results ninety-five percent of students (n=105) recognized the presence of a mental illness in the vignette. However, only seventy-eight (70.9\%) considered psychiatric treatment (medication and/or hospitalization) as the most adequate intervention. Twenty-seven students (24.5\%) determined that a non-psychiatric/non-restrictive intervention was the best treatment. Finally, only five subjects (4.5\%) considered a restrictive intervention (restrain, isolation) as necessary to treat the condition. With respect to etiological aspects, students could choose one or more options that they considered were causing the illness. Global biopsychosocial etiologies as well as single medical, psychological and even familiar problems were attributed by a high percentage of the students as the cause of the condition. Sixty-five students (59.1\%) determined that the individual described in the vignette could be aggressive in some way but only 14 (12.7\%) considered the patient dangerous to society. Students that perceived agressiveness qualified higher in restriction, pessimistic prediction and global scores of the omi-m, indicating more negative attitudes to mental illness. No differences in mental health literacy and perception of aggression and dangerousness were found among students in the first and second stages of their studies. Discussion these findings show that a high percentage of psychology students considered the patient depicted in the vignette as aggressive. This conception, as expected, related to more negative attitudes and a prediction of a negative outcome. Also, many students perceived the patient as someone with limited capacities and a rare behavior generating thus the necessity of social isolation. Although these findings are impossible to be generalized to other groups of students, they suggest the need to include an educational program in the curricula to provide clear and objective information about aspects related to mental illness and stigma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,ATTITUDES;PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS;AGGRESSION;STIGMA;SCHIZOPHRENIA;Schizophrenia;Self Psychology;Attitude;Aggression,,

St-inclusive treatment of traumatic childhood experiences in other personality disorders has also shown significant effects (weertman and arntz, 2007). Considering that personality disorders were understood to be nearly impossible or at least very difficult to treat for a long time, researchers justifiably claim that the outcomes are very encouraging. Conversely, most of the effects of the treatment mean that many patients still suffer from a personality disorder after ending long-term and intensive treatment. Although it is possible that parts of the personality problems are resistant to treatment, it seems likely that treatment of these problems can be improved. One way in which therapy can be developed further is through scientific research into the illness model behind the therapy. Although therapy based on a wrong but convincing illness model can be effective, it is to be expected that therapy based on the right model is more effective and more efficient, at least if the known causes can be treated. This chapter offers an overview of experimental studies into schemas and other factors that are thought to play a causal role in theoretical models. In this chapter a number of themes and questions that emerge from the theory and practice of st are discussed, followed by a description of the experimental studies in which these are researched. The chapter concludes with some pitfalls that may be encountered when implementing this kind of study, and directions for the future.

rayyan-470329326,Lack Of Theory Building And Testing Impedes Progress In The Factor And Network Literature,2020,1,1,PSYCHOLOGICAL INQUIRY,,,,,FRIED EI,,,,,"The applied social science literature using factor and network models continues to grow rapidly. Most work reads like an exercise in model fitting, and falls short of theory building and testing in three ways. First, statistical and theoretical models are conflated, leading to invalid inferences such as the existence of psychological constructs based on factor models, or recommendations for clinical interventions based on network models. I demonstrate this inferential gap in a simulation: excellent model fit does little to corroborate a theory, regardless of quality or quantity of data. Second, researchers fail to explicate theories about psychological constructs, but use implicit causal beliefs to guide inferences. These latent theories have led to problematic best practices. Third, explicated theories are often weak theories: imprecise descriptions vulnerable to hidden assumptions and unknowns. Such theories do not offer precise predictions, and it is often unclear whether statistical effects actually corroborate weak theories or not. I demonstrate that these three challenges are common and harmful, and impede theory formation, failure, and reform. Matching theoretical and statistical models is necessary to bring data to bear on theories, and a renewed focus on theoretical psychology and formalizing theories offers a way forward.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,FACTOR MODEL;FORMAL THEORY;NETWORK MODEL;OPEN SCIENCE;REPLICABILITY;;STATISTICAL EQUIVALENCE;THEORY;Electric Impedance,,

Ss were administered the depression adjective checklist, an empathy test in which the stimulus words were designed to produce a 20% correct answer rate, and an anagram task. It was predicted that the more ss attributed failure on a word-association task to lack of ability (stable attribution), and the more they considered that ability to be important in other situations (global attribution), then the more poorly they would perform on a subsequent anagram task. Although results fail to confirm this prediction, evidence was found for an attributional bias in depression with the more depressed ss making more personal, stable, and global attributions for failure.

Consumers Discuss Their Causal Beliefs And Stigma,2017,1,1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH,,,,,LARKINGS JS and BROWN PM and SCHOLZ B,,,,,"The stigma associated with mental illness has several negative consequences for consumers (e.g., discrimination in employment and accommodation, reduced help-seeking, increased social isolation) and impacts their quality of life. Consumers beliefs around the causes of mental illness are thought to influence stigma and self-stigma. This study aims to investigate the types of causal beliefs consumers endorse about their own mental illness, mental illness in general, and consumers beliefs about causes endorsed by the public. Moreover, this study explores the impact that these beliefs have on factors that influence stigma and self-stigma. A thematic framework guided the analysis of semi-structured interviews with 23 consumers who self-identified as having mental illness. Consumers endorsed multiple causes simultaneously and causes differed between their own mental illness, thinking about mental illness in general, and the causal beliefs perceived to be held by the public. The majority of consumers thought that mental illness in general was caused by a combination of biogenetic, psychological, and environmental factors. Consumers endorsed fewer causal beliefs when considering their own mental illness, with all consumers stating that environmental factors contributed to their illness. Consumers thought that the public had a narrower range of causal beliefs and tended to think the public believed personal weakness/choice caused mental illness. Findings extend previous research and show that consumers causal beliefs may have an impact on several factors (e.g., control and management of illness, self-blame, feelings of responsibility, perceptions towards self) which are thought to influence treatment, recovery, and stigma.

Difficulties in emotion regulation are associated with binge eating and may represent one barrier to long-term intervention effectiveness in obesity. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and the extent of weight regain in a sample of adults who had lost, and then regained, weight, and to examine the characteristics associated with emotional difficulties. Methods: 2000 adults from three european countries (uk, portugal, and denmark) completed an online survey assessing self-reported weight loss and regain following their most recent weight loss attempt. They also completed a binge eating disorder screening questionnaire and, if they had regained weight, were asked if they attributed it to any emotional factors (a proxy for emotion regulation difficulties). Spearmans correlations and logistic regression were used to assess the associations between emotion regulation, weight regain, and strategy use. Results: emotion regulation difficulties were associated with greater weight regain (n = 1594 who lost and regained weight). Attribution to emotional reasons was associated with younger age, female gender, loss of control and binge eating, lower perceptions of success at maintenance, using more dietary and self-regulatory strategies in weight loss, and fewer dietary strategies in maintenance. Conclusions: weight-related emotion regulation difficulties are common amongst regainers and are associated with regaining more weight. Affected individuals are already making frequent use of behavioural strategies during weight loss, but do not apply these consistently beyond active attempts. Simply encouraging the use of more numerous strategies, without concurrently teaching emotion regulation skills, may not be an effective means to improving weight outcomes in this group.

One hundred and fifty-three mhcs participated by completing an online survey with an experimental manipulation in which hypothetical vignettes of narcissistic personality disorder (npd) and schizotypal personality disorder (spd) were paired at random with a genetic or psychosocial cause. Among all mhcs, genetic attributions of personality disorders were significantly associated with reduced empathy. Additionally, for npd, counseling self-efficacy and perceived psychotherapy effectiveness were significantly reduced when attributed to genetics. For spd, perceived medication effectiveness was significantly increased when attributed to genetics. Also, for spd, perceived psychotherapy effectiveness was significantly lower among mhcs with medical training than among those without medical training. Sixteen mhcs also participated in qualitative interviews to further examine beliefs and experiences regarding genetics. Mental health clinicians commonly viewed genetics and environment as equally important causes of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, mhcs emphasized a lack of knowledge of genetics and expressed dissatisfaction with education and training experiences regarding psychiatric genetics. This study adds to the literature by demonstrating adverse clinical impacts of genetic attributions among mhcs and underscores the need for further education and training to attenuate negative impacts in treatment.

Traditional psychiatric precepts suggests that good insight is inversely related to the severity of psychotic symptoms and directly related to depression scores, better clinical outcome, and treatment adherence. However, recent studies have recognised that insight does not predict outcomes, changes over time, and is dependent on the trajectory of the individual's illness and the social and cultural context arguing that ``insight'' is an explanatory model and a coping strategy. Methodological issues related to the assessment of insight, the limitations of psychiatric classification and complex interaction between biology and the environment make simplistic explanations of the concept of insight less than useful. The paper argues that the biomedical model should be presented without dismissing or devaluing patient beliefs and explanations. Psychiatry needs to embrace the complexity of mental illness and value diverse attempts at restoring homeostasis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,INSIGHT;ASSESSMENT;PSYCHOSIS;SCHIZOPHRENIA;CULTURE;Psychotic Disorders,,

A total of 62 patients who underwent renal transplantation in the urological kidney transplantation ward from a comprehensive 3a hospital of fujian province, from december 2016 to february 2018, were randomly divided into two groups: intervention and control group. There were 31 patients in the intervention group who underwent routine renal transplantation combined with attribution training, while 31 patients in the control group received routine renal transplantation. Five instruments were applied to evaluate these two groups of patients which are the basic data questionnaire, depression scale (sds), self-rating anxiety scale (sas), revised piper fatigue scale (rpfs), attribution questionnaire (asq), pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi). Attribution training can effectively improve patients attributional style, reduce depression, improve sleep quality and release fatigue. The early postoperative depression of renal transplant recipients is serious while attribution training can effectively improve depression, the sleep quality and fatigue, which solves the critical problems of clinical practice of kidney transplantation. Thus a strong basis for emotional problems improvement can be provided for renal transplant recipients.

To answer this question, we conducted the first review of the medical literature. Method: the medline, cinahl, and psycinfo databases were searched from 1988 to 2010, seeking case reports of dtd according to the dsm or the international classification of diseases definitions. For each article, we collected epidemiologic and clinical data, explanatory models used by authors, treatments, and information on the outcome. Results: we found 28 articles reporting 402 cases of patients with dtd worldwide. The data show an equal proportion of female and male patients, and a predominance of possession (69\%), compared with trance (31\%). Amnesia is reported by 20\% of patients. Conversely, hallucinatory symptoms during possession episodes were found in 56\% of patients and thus should feature as an important criterion. Somatic complaints are found in 34\% of patients. Multiple explanatory models are simultaneously held and appear to be complementary. Conclusion: data strongly suggest the inclusion of dtd in the dsm-5, provided certain adjustments are implemented. Dtd is a widespread disorder that can be understood as a global idiom of distress, probably underdiagnosed in western countries owing to cultural biases, whose incidence could increase given the rising flow of migration.

However, low rates of help-seeking for memory complaints are well documented. Little is known about the reasons behind the decision to seek or not to seek help with memory problems. The common-sense model of illness perception proposes that the beliefs people hold about their health underlie help-seeking behaviour. The present study investigated factors underlying the decision to seek help in people with smcs within the framework of the common-sense model of illness perception. Methods: cognition, illness perceptions, coping styles, depression and anxiety were assessed in 98 adults with smcs, aged 50 years and above, including 60 attending a memory clinic and 38 non-help-seekers. Results: objective cognitive performance did not differ between participants who had sought help and those who had not. Logistic regression revealed that illness perceptions including social comparison and causal attributions predict help-seeking behaviour. More general coping style did not predict help-seeking. Furthermore, participants who had sought help were more likely to have had a close relative with dementia. Conclusions: the results suggest that beliefs about memory, rather than objective cognitive impairment, are associated with the decision to seek help for smcs. The findings suggest that providing education regarding memory problems, in particular challenging causal attributions, may help to encourage help-seeking in people with smcs and improve care in the early stages of dementia.

Causal attributions of cad and their concordance with actual patient risk profiles were also examined. Method: a prospective study of 193 patients was conducted. Data were collected by self-report and from medical records at 3, 6, and 9 months after discharge. Baseline depression was assessed by structured clinical interview. The association between illness beliefs and adherence was tested with hierarchical linear regression controlling for clinical and demographic confounders. Results: most participants perceived high personal and treatment control and believed cad to be chronic in duration with severe consequences. A relatively low number of symptoms were endorsed as being part of cad. Heredity was considered the single most important and most commonly perceived cause of cad. Smoking, alcohol, emotional state, and heredity were significantly more likely to be endorsed as causal factors by respondents with these risk profiles. In multivariate analysis, illness belief, contributed an additional 6\% of the total variance explained by the model (p =.02). Perceptions of more serious consequences predicted better adherence (p =.03). Social desirability was the best single predictor of adherence. Conclusion: patient perceptions of risk factors were largely consistent with actual risk factors.

Studies show that the physical symptoms of heart failure are associated with depressive symptoms. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of this relationship. Aims: the purpose of our study was to examine the associations between physical symptoms, illness perceptions, coping strategies and depressive symptoms and to test the multiple mediation effects of illness perceptions and coping strategies on the relationship between physical symptoms and depressive symptoms in patients with heart failure. Methods: physical symptoms, illness perceptions, coping strategies and depressive symptoms were assessed using self-reported questionnaires among 302 patients (64.2 +/- 11.9 years, 54\% male) with heart failure in a tertiary general hospital. A serial multiple mediation model was tested using the process macro for spss. Results: depressive symptoms were positively correlated with physical symptoms (r=0.487, p<0.01), illness perceptions (r=0.499, p<0.01) and acceptance-resignation coping (r=0.580, p<0.01). The relationship between physical symptoms and depressive symptoms was mediated by illness perceptions (indirect effect: 0.036, confidence interval (0.014, 0.059)) and by acceptance-resignation (indirect effect: 0.034, confidence interval (0.019, 0.053)), respectively, and by these two in serial (indirect effect: 0.021, confidence interval (0.013, 0.033)).

A new and ambitious program of `causal revolution' has recently emerged in psychiatry that hopes to refurnish our taxonomies by discovering the underlying biological and psychological causes that create and maintain mental illness. I show that the sort of causal story envisioned by the program is a mechanistic property cluster (mpc) structure, which involves a causal mechanism that explains the co-occurrence of a disorder's signs and symptoms. I then build a model of fear in humans and sketch a novel account of specific phobia as a configuration of the fear system in thrall to deregulated network dynamics such as hysteresis, tipping points, and feedback loops. Specific phobia has an mpc structure. I close by reflecting on whether we can reasonably expect other mental disorders to fit an mpc mold, and thus lend themselves to future causal validation. This article shows that specific phobia holds a unique place in our picture of mental disorder that has so far been missed.

Fatigue and musculoskeletal pain are associated features but have never been studied systematically. We used a multidimensional assessment method to measure fatigue, its clinical relevance, and possible determinants. Methods: a questionnaire study was performed among 273 eds patients. The following dimensions were assessed: fatigue severity, functional impairment in daily life, physical activity, psychological distress, sleep disturbances, concentration problems, social functioning, self-efficacy concerning fatigue, causal attribution of fatigue, pain, and disease-related factors. Results: more than three-quarters of eds patients suffer from severe fatigue. Patients who are severely fatigued are more impaired than nonseverely fatigued patients and report a higher level of psychological distress. The 5 possible determinants involved in fatigue are sleep disturbances, concentration problems, social functioning, self-efficacy concerning fatigue, and pain severity. Conclusions: this is the first study of fatigue and its possible determinants in eds and shows that fatigue is a frequent and clinically significant problem in eds.

However, there is limited information in tanzania on the magnitude of perceived distress during pregnancy and meanings ascribed to such distress. A descriptive survey collected data using unstructured interviews from 12 traditional practitioners and 10 peri-urban women with previous pregnancy related mental health concerns identified using a depression vignette. The objectives were to describe the sources and characteristics of distress during pregnancy, and idioms of distress that could inform cultural adaptation of depression screening tools. Narrative analysis showed an emergent category of ""problematic pregnancies"" framed women's recollections of prolonged periods of sadness. This experience was qualified using various idioms of distress that were differentially emphasized depending on informant's perceived causes of health concern. The idiom kusononeka was consistently used to describe extreme sadness across causal categories and clustered with at least two typical features of major depression. This suggested existence of a construct with similarities to biomedical criteria for depression. ""Thinking too much"" emerged as a distinctive expression associated with prolonged sadness. Distinctive expressions of social functioning impairments were identified that can inform depression severity assessments. In conclusion, contextual inquiry into experiences of psychological distress showed distinct local idioms that clustered in patterns similar to symptoms of biomedical depressive episodes. Further studies to assess the utility of local idioms of distress and distress related functional impairment in depression assessment tools are warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,DEPRESSION/*ETHNOLOGY;DEPRESSIVE DISORDER/*ETHNOLOGY;PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS/*PSYCHOLOGY;ATTITUDE TO HEALTH/ETHNOLOGY;CULTURE;DEPRESSION/PSYCHOLOGY;DEPRESSIVE DISORDER/PSYCHOLOGY;FEMALE;HUMANS;MALE;PREGNANCY;SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS;TANZANIA;Pregnancy,,

One-third of young people with cfs/me have probable depression. Little is known about why depression develops, the relationship between depression and cfs/me, or what treatment might be helpful. Methods: we conducted nine semi-structured interviews with young people with cfs/me (aged 13-17years, 8/9 female) and probable depression, covering perceived causes of depression, the relationship between cfs/me and depression, and treatment strategies. Results: most thought cfs/me caused depression. Many discussed a cyclical relationship: low mood made cfs/me worse. A sense of loss was common. Cfs/me restricted activities participants valued and changed systemic structures, causing depression. There was no single helpful treatment approach. Individualised approaches using combinations of cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt), medication, activity management and other strategies were described. Conclusion: this study suggests that depression may be secondary to cfs/me in young people because of the impact of cfs/me on quality of life. Clinicians treating young people with cfs/me need to consider strategies to prevent development of depression, and research is needed into approaches that are effective in treating cfs/me with co-morbid depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME;CFS;ME;DEPRESSION;YOUNG PEOPLE;ADOLESCENTS,,

Responses from 232 college students who were recently cheated on revealed that negative appraisals (partner blame, self-blame, and causal attribution) had indirect effects on health-compromising behaviors through mental health (depression, anxiety, and distress). Moderated mediation analyses revealed that gender altered the indirect effect of partner and self-blame on health-compromising behaviors through mental health. Men's health-compromising behaviors did not differ based on their appraisals or mental health. However, women who reported negative appraisals and high levels of mental health consequences engaged in more health-compromising behaviors.

One potential explanatory model suggests abnormal neuromodulation in specific neural networks may result in reduced attention to socially important cues, leading to poorer understanding of another's emotional state or intentions. Objective: the current study experimentally manipulated neural networks using tdcs to examine this potential causal mechanism. The primary aim was to determine whether stimulation to the right temporoparietal junction (rtpj) improves visual attention, and secondary aims were to determine whether 1) stimulation improves social cognitive performance and 2) visual attention moderates this improved performance. Method: using a double-blind crossover design, 69 individuals with schizophrenia underwent both active and sham stimulation to either the rtpj of the ventral attention network (n = 36) or the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of the social brain network (dmpfc; n = 33). Following stimulation, participants completed tasks assessing emotion recognition and mentalizing. Concurrent eye tracking assessed visual attention, measuring proportion of time spent attending to areas of interest. Results: for emotion recognition, stimulation failed to impact either visual attention or social cognitive task accuracy. Similarly, neurostimulation failed to affect visual attention on the mentalizing task. However, exploratory analyses demonstrated that mentalizing accuracy significantly improved after stimulation to the active comparator, dmpfc, with no improvement after stimulation to rtpj. Conclusion: results demonstrate limited effect of a single stimulation session on visual attention and emotion recognition accuracy but provide initial support for an alternate neural mechanism for mentalizing, highlighting the importance of executive functions over visual attention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,SCHIZOPHRENIA;SOCIAL COGNITION;NEUROSTIMULATION;TDCS;VISUAL;ATTENTION;Schizophrenia;Photic Stimulation,,

Epidemiological studies report a higher incidence of depression among women then men (approximately 2:1). Among the various theories suggested to explain this gender difference, sex roles, attributional style, and self-discrepancy have been conceived as possible explanations. The relationship between gender and depression may be better understood through examining the possible contribution of these three independent variables. To examine these theories, a sample of 130 subjects was drawn from clients at the usu counseling center, the usu community clinic, the logan regional hospital, and students from an introductory psychology class at usu. Participation was based on voluntary informed consent of the subjects and approval of the above mentioned institutions. Each subject completed the beck depression inventory (bdi), extended attributional style questionnaire (easq), and a revised version of the short bem sex-role inventory (sbsri) measuring ideal versus actual self. Path analysis was used to examine the sequence of the relationships presumed by the androgyny model, congruence model, and masculinity model. Neither sex role was found to correlate significantly with depression. Overall, the directions of the path coefficients best supported the androgyny model, but these coefficients were too weak to explain the variance. Attributional style was related to depression, but no gender difference was found in the correlation between attributional style and depression. The correlation coefficient between feminine self-discrepancy and depression was positive but statistically insignificant for the females from the clinical sample and very small for females from the student sample.

Participants prompted with the myalgic encephalopathy name were more likely to attribute a biomedical cause to the illness, and less likely to consider patients as candidates for organ donation than those prompted with the cfs name. Although the medical trainees were less likely to consider the patient as malingering, and more likely to view the illness as leading to poorer quality of life and a poorer prognosis, they were also more likely to consider the illness a form of primary depression, more likely to think the patient would attempt suicide, and less likely to consider associated cognitive symptoms as severe.

In their postcrisis communication, food companies often direct the blame at the perpetrator in an effort to mitigate potential losses and regain consumer trust. The attempt to placate consumers may, in itself, potentially create psychological ripple effects in message readers. This study examined the interacting influence of two message characteristics: identity of the perpetrator of the crime (in-group/out-group membership), and the attribution of blame (reason why the perpetrator committed the crime), with message receiver characteristic (cultural identity) on psychological ripple effects such as blame, trust, anxiety, and future purchase intention. Results indicated that although group membership of the perpetrator was not significant in predicting outcomes for the organization, the attribution communicated in the message was. American message receivers blamed the organization more and trusted it less when personal dispositional attributions were made about the perpetrator. Asian message receivers blamed the organization more and trusted it less when situational attributions were made about the perpetrator. Lowered trust in the company and increased anxiety correlated with lower purchase intent for both american and asian message receivers. Implications for crisis message design are discussed.

Similarly high rates have not been reported in the countries of origin of these groups, which has led to a search for possible causes within the uk. The search for biological causes has not been fruitful. A number of social and service-related risk factors have been proffered to explain differences in illness rates, including socio-economic status, the role of psychiatry in social control, the validity of european illness models in ethnic minority groups, and the use of universalist rather than relativist approaches to psychopathology and diagnosis. These have rarely been investigated in depth and may be better studied using qualitative approaches rather than the quantitative epidemiological approaches that are currently relied on.

While the etiology of stigma may differ between conditions and, sometimes, cultural settings, the manifestations and psychosocial consequences of stigma and discrimination are remarkably similar. However, the vast majority of studies measuring stigma or addressing stigma through interventions employ a disease-specific approach. The current paper opposes this siloed approach and advocates a generic concept of `health-related stigma' in both stigma measurement and stigma interventions. Employing a conceptual model adapted from weiss, the current paper demonstrates the commonalities among several major stigmatized conditions by examining how several stigma measurement instruments, such as the social distance scale, explanatory model interview catalogue, internalized stigma of mental illness, and berger stigma scale, and stigma reduction interventions, such as information-based approaches, contact with affected persons, (peer) counselling, and skills building and empowerment, were used successfully across a variety of conditions to measure or address stigma. The results demonstrate that `health-related stigma' is a viable concept with clearly identifiable characteristics that are similar across a variety of stigmatized health conditions in very diverse cultures. A more generic approach to the study of health-related stigma opens up important practical opportunities - cross-cutting measurement and intervention tools are resource saving and easier to use for personnel working with multiple conditions, allow for comparison between conditions, and recognize the intersectionality of many types of stigma. Further research is needed to build additional evidence demonstrating the advantages and effectiveness of cross-condition approaches to stigma measurement and interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,HEALTH-RELATED STIGMA;MEASUREMENT;INTERVENTIONS;CROSS-CUTTING;APPROACHES;HIV;MENTAL HEALTH;LEPROSY;TUBERCULOSIS;NEGLECTED;TROPICAL DISEASES;DISABILITIES,,

In part i, we content-analyze recommendations from 10 current self-help books on anxiety and 10 on depression. In part ii, we asked 17 respected therapists and 18 individuals who believed that they have recovered from anxiety and 23 individuals who believe they have recovered from depression what they believe are the keys for recovery. We also asked them to rate the efficacy of seven popular affirmations. Through content analysis and descriptive statistics, we summarize their collective wisdom. Among the main findings are the recommendations for anxious and depressed individuals to actively seek help from multiple people and interventions, as well as to being open to trying innovative self-tailored interventions.

The objectives of the study were to explore the knowledge and attitudes of pakistani university students toward mental illnesses. People with mental illnesses are challenged not only by their symptoms but also by the prejudices associated with their illness. Acknowledging the stigma of mental illness should be the first essential step toward devising an appropriate treatment plan. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the university of punjab, lahore, cmh lahore medical and dental college, lahore, and university of sargodha, sub-campus lahore, from february to may 2014. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographics, general knowledge of psychiatric illnesses, and community attitudes towards mental illnesses (cami) scale. The questionnaire was distributed to 650 participants enrolled in different disciplines (social sciences, medicine and formal sciences). Results. Response rate was 81\% (527/650 respondents). Mean age was 20.98 years. Most of the students (331, 62.8\%) had an urban background and studied social sciences (238, 45.2\%). Four hundred and eighteen respondents (79.3\%) considered religion very important and most respondents considered psychiatrists (334, 63.4\%) and spiritual leaders (72, 13.7\%) to be best able to treat mental illnesses. One hundred and sixty nine respondents (32.1\%) considered black magic to be a cause of mental illness. Only 215 (41\%) respondents had ever read an article on mental illnesses. Multiple regression analysis revealed study discipline, exposure, perceived causes of mental illnesses and superstitions to be significantly associated with attitudes towards mental illnesses (p < .05). Conclusion. Although low awareness and exposure were found in this sample of pakistani university students, their attitude towards mental illnesses was generally positive. Most respondents gave supernatural explanations for mental illnesses but only a few believed that spiritual leaders can play a role in treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,SOCIAL STIGMA;ATTITUDE;MENTAL ILLNESS;SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY;SHAME;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,

Neither communication apprehension nor social anxiety was associated with causal attributions for speechlessness or the event's duration. Study 2 contrasted speechlessness arising from involuntary and voluntary origins. Participants who attributed their speechlessness to strategic causes reported higher levels of guilt and embarrassment but less overall negative affect than those who attributed their speechlessness to less volitional causes.

To distinguish between these competing explanations, the current authors employed a genetically and environmentally controlled sibling design (n = 101 sister pairs; ages 1836), which retrospectively examined the effects of differential sibling exposure to family disruption/father absence and quality of fathering. Consistent with a causal explanation, differences between older and younger sisters in the effects of quality of fathering on rsb were greatest in biologically disrupted families when there was a large age gap between the sisters (thus maximizing differential exposure to fathers), with greater exposure within families to higher quality fathering serving as a protective factor against rsb.

The person who experiences an ami must recover physically from the insult to the myocardium and must also adapt cognitively and emotionally to the life-threatening event of ami. Guided by the self-regulation of illness the purpose of this predictive correlational study was to determine the impact of illness representation (a measure of cognitive adaptation) at the time of ami on indicators of the stress response and on various physiologic and psychologic measures of recovery and adaptation. Illness representation, depression, anxiety, heart rate variability, salivary cortisol and the occurrence of complications were measured 24 to 48 hours after hospital admission in 49 subjects with ami who were treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between illness representation (as measured by the illness perception questionnaire); and depression (as measured by the beck depression inventory-ii) (r2 = .557, adjusted r2 = .409, f = 3.77, p = .001) and anxiety (as measured by the spielberger state anxiety inventory) (r2 = .56, adjusted r2 = .42, f = 3.87, p = .001) when controlling for sociodemographic, health history and lvef. Hierarchical logistic regression demonstrated that when holding all other independent variables constant, for each one unit increase in illness representation score the odds of having a complication increase by 8.3 percent (b = .08, wald = 5.59, p = .018, exp(b) = 1.083). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis did not support a relationship between illness representation; and measures of heart rate variability (i.e. Time domain and spectral analysis) or salivary cortisol. Illness representation after ami does have an impact on recovery. Persons with a negative representation of the meaning and significance of having suffered heart attack are more likely to be depressed and/or anxious and are more likely to experience a complication during the acute hospital stay.

Possible explanations for the sex differences in rates of depression are explored, including artifactual, psychosocial, genetic, and endocrine, and recent improvements in the specification and reliability of psychiatric diagnosis that have accelerated these research efforts are noted. Evidence indicates that these findings are not an artifact of differences between the sexes in reporting or seeking help; however, there are at present no definitive psychosocial explanations. Two studies suggest that genetic transmission per se cannot account for the sex difference. Endocrine studies have increased attention, and evidence indicates that demographic changes are of likely importance. It is suggested that research in these areas must also consider a birth cohort effect and the heterogeneity of major depression. It is concluded that it is unlikely that any one explanation will account for all these phenomena or that all types of depression will be associated with the same risk factors.

Results: participants in the group that were explicitly informed that the patient had a bpd diagnostic label reported significantly fewer reasons to be optimistic than the other two groups.

Affected individuals have an increased probability of involvement with the criminal justice system, contributing to a higher rate of arrest, and imprisonment compared with the general population; they are also inadequately treated once sentenced. Because prison staff play a central role in the identification of inmates with mental disorders, they could well be key to improving provision of care. There is however little knowledge of the conceptions, perceptions, and attitudes of prison staff toward adhd. Such information could help to identify starting points for awareness training and further implementation of specific adhd treatment. To bridge this gap, we undertook a study based on a qualitatively-driven mixed methods design, combining qualitative data collection in the form of narrative interviews with 19 prison staff from a swiss correctional facility with quantitative data collection in the form of a survey that included the attitudes toward prisoners scale. The interviews were analyzed with qsr nvivo 11 and a qualitative content analysis approach was used to evaluate findings. Prison staff were generally aware of adhd and its symptomology, believing it to a be ``real,'' but ``fashionable'' disorder and favoring hereditary-genetic or biological explanatory models for its development. They viewed inmates with adhd rather negatively, as complicating correctional efforts, and perceived them as sticking out, as tying up more resources and as frequently being involved in confrontations. Our findings suggest that difficulties in pragmatic aspects of communication and language comprehension may be perceived ``as not listening or following instructions,'' creating additional tensions. Consequently, inmates with adhd are more often exposed to disciplinary sanctions, such as solitary confinement-an intervention deemed ``necessary'' by staff. Therefore, staff training on adhd might need to cover evidence on adverse effects. Non-pharmacological interventions for treatment were preferred and considered to be highly efficacious. Skepticism toward pharmacological treatment prevailed, even when benefits from stimulant medication were described. Interestingly, this skepticism was not the result of negative experiences with the misuse and diversion of stimulants. Acceptance of multimodal treatment among prison staff may require customized strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,ATTENTION-DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD);ATTITUDES;CORRECTIONAL;FACILITIES;PRISONS;TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT;STAFF ACCEPTABILITY;;KNOWLEDGE-ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOR;PERCEPTION;QUALITATIVE RESEARCH;Prisons;Prisoners,,

This theoretical review aims to set the ground for future research on such cultural aspects in the dso. It provides a theoretical introduction to cultural clinical psychology, followed by a summary of evidence on cultural research related to ptsd and dso.

Reliable and valid assessment of ems may be hindered by interviewer and respondent disparities on certain demographic characteristics, such as ethnicity. The present study examined (a) whether ethnic minority patients reported different ems to ethnically similar interviewers in comparison with those with a different ethnicity, and (b) whether this effect was related to respondents social desirability, the perceived rapport with the interviewer and level of uncertainty toward their ems. Methods: a total of 55 patients of turkish and moroccan origins with mood and anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to ethnically similar or dissimilar interviewers. Ems were assessed, using a semi-structured interview, across 11 different categories of causes. Results: participants who were interviewed by an ethnically similar interviewer perceived interpersonal, victimization and religious/mystical causes as more important, whereas interviews by ethnically dissimilar interviewers generated higher scores on medical causes. These effects were not mediated by the perceived rapport with the interviewer, and social desirability had a modest impact on the results.

Using arksey and o'malley's methodical framework, we conducted a scoping review of the published literature, using electronic databases medline and psycinfo, and searched for articles published since 1999. Out of 1177 articles identified, 21 met the inclusion criteria. Thematic synthesis revealed valuable scholarly work on (1) depression rates, migration, and contextual determinants, (2) causation beliefs and help seeking, (3) acculturation and symptoms, (4) presenting symptoms and somatization, and (5) culturally sensitive assessment and care. Overall, this review has identified the importance of contextual determinants in the development of depression, low rates of seeking of professional help, subtle variations in somatization, and knowledge gaps in culturally sensitive care. The findings suggest that, rather than treating migration as a cause of mental distress, the accompanying conditions and events need to be further examined and addressed as potential risk or protective factors. Subtle variations in somatization are also evident, and future scholarly work should examine the notion of cultural scripts-namely, that people attend and react to particular experiences in culturally based ways. For this reason (among others), practice models need to develop strategies for culturally sensitive care, such as co-construction of illness narratives and finding common ground. Given the stigma of mental illness and the low level of seeking professional help, the role of primary care should be expanded. Further studies investigating mental health issues beyond depression are also warranted in the studied community.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,CHINESE;DEPRESSION;IMMIGRANTS;MENTAL HEALTH;SOMATIC SYMPTOMS,,

Adolescents with various psychiatric diagnoses were interviewed using a structured questionnaire including the illness perceptions questionnaire-revised (ipq-r). Results: fifty-two adolescents with various psychiatric illnesses were interviewed; their mean age was 12.7 years and the majority (67%) were female. Males had significantly higher scores on timeline and emotional representation (p<0.05), suggesting strongly held beliefs about chronicity of their illness and anger and worry about their condition. Adolescents own emotional state, stress, family problems and bad luck were endorsed by participants as some of the causal factors in their mental illness. Clinical implications: despite the importance of early intervention in psychiatric problems, engaging youth in the treatment process in pakistan remains difficult.

Today many articles and textbooks are written as though it has been established that major mental disorders are caused by brain disorders. The evidence on which these statements are founded however, is often equivocal. Biological theorists are reductionists. They assume that brain-behavior explanations proceed in one direction, from brain to behavior. Psychosocial factors are considered to be secondary influences, if they are considered at all, in explanations of mental disorders. These theorists tend to overlook two fundamental aspects of reductionistic explanatory models: (1) mental and social phenomena cannot be adequately understood at the level of physical processes, and (2) brain-behavior influences can proceed in either direction. This paper will review the reasons why much evidence of biological causality of mental disorders should be considered to be tentative rather than conclusive. It is argued that adequate explanatory models of mental disorders require adoption of a general systems theory model that will allow for the integration of knowledge from multiple levels of analysis, including biological, psychosocial, and cultural influences.

Taking the perspective of weiner's attribution theory, the biogenetic explanations can be helpful in reducing the perceptions of controllability of mental illnesses (e.g., schizophrenia). However, recent studies reveal that biogenetic explanations may increase social stigma and discrimination against people with schizophrenia. Aims: the current research, using weiner's attribution theory, empirically examined the effects of biogenetic beliefs on the desire for social distance via perceptions of controllability and stability of schizophrenia using a chinese sample. Methods: a cross-sectional study (n = 156) and an experiment (n = 124) were carried out. Participants were recruited from an urban city in china. In the experiment, participants were randomly assigned to receive a biogenetic/control lecture and filled out a survey. Results: biogenetic beliefs had indirect effects on the desire for social distance via decreased perceived controllability and increased perceived stability, which resulted in little to no change on the desire for social distance. Conclusion: the biogenetic approach could decrease the perceptions of controllability of schizophrenia which may reduce the desire for social distance; however, it could also increase the perceptions of stability which may increase the desire for social distance, especially among close others. Cautions are warranted when using and disseminating the biogenetic causes of schizophrenia amongin the general public.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,SCHIZOPHRENIA;BIOGENETIC APPROACH;ATTRIBUTION;CHINA;Schizophrenia,,

Where pluralistic attributions for mental health problems predominate, the development of global mental health (gmh) interventions in the form of task-shifting approaches create increased access to new ways of understanding and responding to distress. However, little is known about how participants in these initiatives manage these encounters. This qualitative study in malawi explored village-based health workers' (hsas) and patients' and carers' views of the causes of distress and how these beliefs influenced help-seeking and the health workers' response. Eight hsas and nine paired patients/carers were interviewed separately to enable each of nine experiences of distress to be explored. Findings revealed a complex set of personal, social and cultural influences that informed causative attributions and help-seeking decisions. Patients/carers viewed psychosocial stresses as compelling explanations and readily reported others attributing their distress to supernatural causes (bewitchment). Yet attributional beliefs alone were not the only influence over help-seeking, which evolved pragmatically in response to the impact of treatments and social pressure for conformity. In turn hsas navigated the interactions with patients/carers by emphasising the biomedical approach and discrediting bewitchment attributions. This caused tensions when biomedical interventions were unhelpful or the traditional healers' approach proved beneficial. Conclusions add to the call for such task-shifting approaches to work with communities to discern authentic and practical responses to mental distress that mirror the `pluralism and pragmatism' found in the communities they serve.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Ian""=>[""No focus on specific mental disorder""]}",,MALAWI;MENTAL HEALTH;CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS;HELP-SEEKING;TRADITIONAL;BELIEFS,,

Indeed, patients with mental illness appear to be more involved in r/s than the general population, lean on r/s to cope with symptoms, and find that r/s is often instrumental in the recovery process. R/s coping, however, is not always positive; the illness may produce clinically significant religious impairment. In short, r/s may be both a resource and a burden in patients lives. It follows that treatment that overlooks the r/s dimension is likely to be less effective. In this work, clinicians must consider the cultural context of the patient, for it shapes the patients r/s and his or her explanatory models of mental disorders and treatment. Furthermore, the clinician needs to be aware of his or her own r/s history, attitudes, and orientation to avoid imposing his or her view of r/s on the patient and to convey a sense of respectfulness and openness to the patients worldview. To achieve this task, clinicians need training in r/s issues, clinical practice, and supervision. Although work in the area of r/s and severe mental disorder is still in its early stages, it offers the promise of providing people with a more holistic and effective approach to their care.

Ss were asked to rate each face as either 'intelligent' or 'unintelligent' and then as either 'contented' or 'discontented.' The paranoid schizophrenics were less systematic than both the normals and the nonparanoid schizophrenics in their use of the stimulus dimensions in the judgments; the latter 2 groups were not significantly different in this respect. It was also found that there were significant differences among the groups regarding the average importance given to the different physical features with the profiles for the 2 schizophrenic groups being flatter than those of the nonschizophrenics.

Bailey (see record [rid]2020-69802-008[/rid]). The idea that something is inherently pathologic about people with sexual minority identities has a long and persistent history. Such theories, including biological and psychoanalytic approaches, have posited that homosexuality and mental illnesses are closely linked (byne, 2007; drescher, 2015). Following post-world war ii scientific development of stress theory and research on stigma and prejudice more generally, minority stress theory departed from this formulation in arguing that what makes sexual minority people ill are social arrangements (hobfoll, 1998; meyer, 2003). Most recently, bailey (2020) proposed a 'rival' genetic model to explain sexual minority disparities in mental health outcomes. In fig. 1, accompanying this commentary, the current authors depict baileys proposed model. The fgure shows that a genetic factor is responsible for both same-sex sexual orientation and neuroticism. In turn, neuroticism is related to rejection sensitivity and adverse mental health outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety). Neuroticism, together with these adverse mental health outcomes, is associated with increased reports of exposure to stigma, prejudice, and discrimination. This neatly explains the observation that sexual minorities report excess minority stress and adverse outcomes. In this model, reports of exposure to stigma, prejudice, and discrimination are spurious artifacts of neuroticism rather than accurate reflections of the world. This model is very different than the minority stress model, which has served as a leading model in explaining sexual and gender minority health disparities (institute of medicine, 2011). Bailey (2020) restricted his comments to sexual minorities, so the current authors discuss only sexual minorities in this reply, but similar arguments can be made regarding gender minorities. In summary, the current authors have shown that studies using multiple measures and designs extend the evidence for minority stress beyond the associational self-reports of stigma exposure cited by bailey (2020). They have also shown that the evidence for a genetic model, proposed by bailey as a rival to the minority stress model, is overly simplistic in its causal attributions and that the research evidence for such a model is weak.

F. Ho (1998), asian psychology is the study of psychological phenomena from an asian perspective that is rooted in systems of thought based in or gleaned from asian cultures. To this end, the histories, languages, and sociocultural practices of peoples from asia all represent sources of data from which the field has developed and grown. This chapter on the psychology of asians provides a critical foundation to a volume devoted to understanding psychopathology among asians. Culture shapes how individuals conceptualize and express psychological distress, thus culturally based explanatory models that take into account asian beliefs, values, and relational and personality styles greatly enhance the understanding of psychopathology among asians from an asian perspective. In addition, asian psychological concepts are useful to an understanding of the impact of mental illness. For example, lawrence yang and colleagues (2007) recently explored the influence of moral experience, or what matters most for individuals in their everyday living, on stigma about schizophrenia among chinese. Because social ties are central to the moral experience for many chinese, the stigma of schizophrenia can place individuals with schizophrenia and their families at great social risk for losing invaluable social connections. Within this cultural context, schizophrenia signifies more than an individual affliction, and family members must conceal the individual's mental illness or shun him or her in order to maintain the social network. Yang et al. Argued that through considering the relational aspect of chinese families, we can better understand the cost of schizophrenia for chinese with this mental illness. In this chapter, we describe the history of asian psychology and the core developments in this field as they relate to the study of psychopathology among asians. We then discuss challenges posed by the globalization of psychology and psychopathology. As the field of asian psychology is vast and growing rapidly, we provide selective coverage of the issues most salient to psychopathology and mental health.

Despite several prognostic studies on chronic fatigue, little attention has been paid to occupational outcomes. Method: a total of 127 fatigued employees on sick leave were followed-up after 4 years to determine long-term predictors of work disability, fatigue caseness and chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs)-like caseness. Measures included fatigue, physical functioning, illness attributions, psychological problems and emotional exhaustion. Results: thirty-three participants (26%) were receiving work disability benefits at the 4-year follow-up. Older age and lower levels of physical functioning predicted work disability. Weaker psychological attributions and lower levels of physical functioning were predictors of fatigue caseness. Cfs-like caseness was predicted by female gender and lower levels of physical functioning. Self-reported physical functioning remained a strong and statistically significant determinant of work disability [odds ratio (or) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.24-0.87] and cfs-like caseness (or 0.20, 95% ci 0.09-0.43) after controlling for confounders. Conclusions: this study suggests that physical functioning plays an important role in the persistence of fatigue complaints and work disability in employees on sick leave. The course of fatigue is a complex process, and exploring temporal relationships between fatigue, functional status and work status in future research could provide valuable information for the improvement of fatigue management.

This model holds that patients' florid symptoms and marked behavioral excesses are more likely to be perceived by their spouses as illness-caused and, consequently, will be associated with less marital discord than negative symptoms or symptoms that involve behavioral deficits. Consistent with this model, the classification of patients on the basis of their predominant symptom profiles revealed significant differences in the marital satisfaction ratings of their spouses. Spouses of patients with negative symptoms and impulse-control deficits reported significantly lower levels of marital satisfaction than spouses of patients with positive symptoms.

If attributions are an important cause of prejudice, what causes attributions? The background and context of attributions are an individual's entire network of beliefs and values. Attributions do not spring up separately and disconnected from each other, but they have an internal consistency, relate to each other in predictable ways, and make coherent sense. Attributions are ideological. As discussed in this chapter, attributions also come from prejudice. People will make attributions for the controllability of poverty or unemployment of fat people, or their negative health outcomes, to the extent that they dislike them. Alternatively, a sympathetic observer will emphasize genetics and physiology as causes of fatness and correlated health variables. Nevertheless, attributional approaches give an excellent proximal account of anti-fat attitudes and are an essential part of understanding this prejudice. In some cases, attributions are likely to serve as justifications for more ultimate causes, such as culture or evolutionary processes. In other cases, the attributions themselves are likely to form the foundation of prejudice. Attributional approaches integrate well theoretically with other approaches, and are certain to play a key role in any comprehensive account of prejudice against fat people.

This review critically examines the notion put forward in the literature that acs-associated depression constitutes a meaningful subtype that is qualitatively different from depressive syndromes observed in psychiatric patients; and evaluates the salience of an analogy to the acute sickness response to infection or injury as an explanatory model. Specific features differentiating acs-associated depression from other phenotypes are discussed, including differences in depression symptom profiles, timing of the depressive episode in relation to acs, severity of the cardiac event, and associated immune activation. While an acute sickness response analogy offers a plausible conceptual framework, concrete evidence is lacking for inflammatory activity as the triggering mechanism. It is likely that acs-associated depression encompasses several causative scenarios. (C) 2015 elsevier inc.

Abnormal lateralization of the functional language network, increased reliance on visual processing areas, and increased posterior brain activation have all been reported in asd and proposed as explanatory models of language difficulties. Nevertheless, inconsistent findings across studies have prevented a comprehensive characterization of the functional language network in asd. The aim of this study was to quantify common and consistent patterns of brain activation during language processing in asd and typically developing control (td) participants using a meta-analytic approach. Activation likelihood estimation (ale) meta-analysis was used to examine 22 previously published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri)/positron emission tomography studies of language processing (asd: n=328; td: n=324). Tasks included in this study addressed semantic processing, sentence comprehension, processing figurative language, and speech production. Within-group analysis showed largely overlapping patterns of language-related activation in asd and td groups. However, the asd participants, relative to td participants, showed: (1) more right hemisphere activity in core language areas (i.e., superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus), particularly in tasks where they had poorer performance accuracy; (2) bilateral mtg hypo-activation across many different paradigms; and (3) increased activation of the left lingual gyrus in tasks where they had intact performance. These findings show that the hypotheses reviewed here address the neural and cognitive aspects of language difficulties in asd across all tasks only in a limited way. Instead, our findings suggest the nuances of language and brain in asd in terms of its context-dependency. Autism res2016, 9: 1046-1057.

The literature has consistently demonstrated multiple pathways for predicting spousal violence, yet few studies have developed and tested integrative explanatory models of male spousal violence. Towards this end, this study attempts to construct a model of male spousal violence, based on an ecological framework of domestic violence. Predictors of spousal violence were integrated and examined at four theoretical levels of analyses: (1) ontogenic level: childhood exposure to family violence, borderline personality organization, anger and alcohol problem; (2) macrosystemic level: gender role belief and supportive attitude towards wife beating; (3) exosystemic level: socio-economic status and; (4) microsystemic level: marital satisfaction and psychological aggression. In addition, multiple pathways predictive of psychological aggression, the secondary criterion variable of the study, were also hypothesized and tested. A sub-group analysis based on immigration status on factors predictive of male spousal violence, and the role of acculturation on immigrant batterers were also investigated. Two hundred and twenty-six court-mandated male batterers from the greater toronto area participated in the study through the completion of a self report questionnaire. Path analyses were conducted on the cross-sectional data to examine the various interrelationships between parameters of the model. Goodness of fit indices supported the adequacy of the model, which accounted for 41% of the variance. Of the 9 hypothesized variables, 7 significantly predicted physical violence, except for men's trait anger and gender role beliefs. Childhood exposure to family violence was the strongest predictor of future perpetration of spousal violence. Multiple indirect pathways for explaining partner abuse were also identified. Immigrant batterers in the study were found to share similar predictors of violence with non-immigrants. However, men's level of acculturation failed to be a significant predictor of spousal violence. The results of the study were discussed with respect to an ecological analysis of spousal violence. In terms of clinical implications, counsellors are recommended to pay heed to the various empirically validated risk factors when undertaking assessments. An integrated treatment philosophy, which combines both gender resocialization and cognitive behavioural interventions are also recommended.

So far, the debate on class inequalities in health has mainly been centred around hypotheses on artefactual and selectional processes. Although most contributors to this branch of research have argued in favour of causal explanations, these have gained very little systematic scrutiny. In this article, several possible causal factors are singled out for empirical testing. The effect of these factors on class differences in physical and mental illness is studied by means of logit regressions. On the basis of these analyses, it is shown that physical working conditions are the prime source of class inequality in physical illness, although economic hardship during upbringing and health related behaviours also contribute. For class inequality in mental illness these three factors plus weak social network are important. In sum, a large part of the class differences in physical as well as mental illness can be understood as a result of systematic differences between classes in living conditions, primarily differences in working conditions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,HEALTH STATUS*;SOCIAL CLASS*;ADOLESCENT;ADULT;AGED;CAUSALITY;HUMANS;MENTAL DISORDERS/ETIOLOGY;MIDDLE AGED;SOCIAL SUPPORT;SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS;SWEDEN/EPIDEMIOLOGY;WORK;Socioeconomic Factors,,

Objective: the study examined whether causal attributions (natural, mystic, punitive and emotional) to a specific disability-visual impairments - mediate the relationship between culture and stigma towards individuals with visual impairments. Methods: a quota sample comprised of 305 university and college students was drawn. Data were collected via a self-reported questionnaire. Results: the main findings indicated that emotional and punitive causal attribution to visual impairments mediated the relationship between culture and visual impairments-stigma; israeli arab-palestinians had a higher tendency to attribute higher levels of punitive and emotional causes to visual impairments compared to israeli jews. Higher levels of punitive and emotional attributed causes for visual impairments were correlated with higher levels of visual impairments-stigma. Israeli arab-palestinians have a higher tendency to attribute visual impairments to mystic causes compared to israeli jews. However, this type of perceived causation was unrelated to visual impairments-stigma. Conclusions: interventions to reduce visual impairments-stigma should focus on misconceptions concerning causation. It is especially important to design culturally sensitive interventions for visual impairments stigma reduction among israeli arab-palestinians, which will focus on de-psychologizing visual impairments.

Young adolescents (n = 713, grades 5-7) completed questionnaires three times in their regular classrooms over 14 months. Participants who reported more self-blame for rejection were more likely to withdraw in response to rejection threat, and withdrawal and anxious rs were associated with increased depressive symptoms at t3 relative to t1. In contrast, adolescents higher in the angry form of rs and who reported more peer-blame for rejection were more likely to seek retribution, which in turn was associated with more overt/relational aggressive behavior at t3 relative to t1. Depressive symptom level measured at t1 also was associated with later rs and coping with withdrawal, and aggressive behavior at t1 was associated with later retribution. Sex of the participants did not moderate any longitudinal associations, and only one prospective path, from t1 depressive symptoms to t2 rs anxious, was moderated by age.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,PEER REJECTION;COPING;REJECTION SENSITIVITY;DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS;;AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR;Anger;Anxiety;Aggression,,

Attribution theory has been posited as an explanation for this relationship. Given that evidence-based psychotherapy is effective yet often not delivered to individuals with depression, the present study sought to determine factors that impact treatment credibility. Design non-treatment-seeking, depressed individuals (n = 229) were randomly assigned to read a psychoeducation article about depression that consisted of a biological causal explanation, psychosocial causal explanation, or a non-causal control. Methods attributional dimensions of locus, stability, and control were examined as mediating the relationship between causal explanation and treatment credibility and prognostic pessimism. Results individuals in the biological condition were more likely to find antidepressant medication a credible treatment for depression. The manipulation had no direct effect on preference for psychotherapy or prognostic pessimism. Attributional dimensions of locus, stability, and control did not mediate the relationship between causal explanation and treatment credibility. To the extent that the psychosocial article increased perceived instability of the depression cause, however, prognostic pessimism was reduced. Conclusions the present study has implications for framing education about depression in mental health literacy programs and public awareness campaigns. Practitioner points this study found that conceptualizing depression as biologically caused increased the credibility of medication but not psychotherapy participants reading a biological explanation of depression demonstrated an increase on some aspects of stigma and prognostic pessimism emphasizing the person-environment interaction rather than biological causes decreased the perceived stability of depression which was associated with a decrease in prognostic pessimism","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,ATTRIBUTION THEORY;CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS;DEPRESSION;AETIOLOGY;TREATMENT CREDIBILITY,,

However, its dynamic structure is currently unknown. The study aimed to estimate the dynamic structure of ptg at the nuance level based on ptg measurement items using network analysis. A three-wave longitudinal study was conducted from july 20, 2021, to january 30, 2022, among the victims experiencing the 2021 henan floods. The final sample (n = 297) completed reports of ptg after 0, 3, and 6 months of the disaster. We employed the graphical vector autoregressive model approach to estimate extended network models. Contemporaneous network results revealed strong positive associations between domains of ptg in the same measurement window, especially between new possibilities and personal strength. Moreover, temporal network resultsthe internal interplays among ptg items across measurement windowsrevealed that the domain of relating to others plays a central role in the dynamics of ptg. Although other domains predicted an increase in relating to others, relating to others inhibited the development of other domains, especially new possibilities and personal strength. Our study identifies the culture-specific process of ptg and provides empirical evidence on the explanatory models of ptg and the janusface model of ptg.

Three hundred and eighty-one italian students attending their first or fifth/sixth year of medical studies read a vignette portraying someone who met diagnostic criteria for `schizophrenia' and completed a self-report questionnaire. The study found that labeling the case as `schizophrenia' and naming heredity among its causes were associated with confidence in psychiatrists and psychiatric drugs. Naming psychological traumas among the causes was associated with confidence in psychologists and greater acknowledgment of users' right to be informed about drugs. Compared to first year students, those at their fifth/sixth-year of studies more strongly endorsed drugs, had less confidence in psychologists and family support, and were less keen to share information on drugs with patients. These findings highlight that students' beliefs vary during training and are significantly related to diagnostic labeling and belief in a biogenetic causal model. Psychiatric curricula for medical students should include greater integration of psychological and medical aspects in clinical management of `schizophrenia': more information on the psychosocial causes of mental health problems.

However, biogenetic explanations convey both stigmatizing and destigmatizing meanings (reducing blame but inducing perceived dangerousness and pessimism). This ambiguity may allow motivational factors to influence how individuals make sense of biogenetic explanations. In this research, we aimed: (1) to shed light on the motives that underpin stigmatizing attitudes, and (2) to investigate if these motives also predict how people interpret biogenetic explanations. In study 1 (n = 177), we found that motivations to compete for group dominance (social dominance orientation; sdo) and to maintain security and social cohesion (right wing authoritarianism; rwa) were associated with stigmatizing attitudes toward individuals suffering from depression and schizophrenia. Further, biogenetic explanations had different implications for stigma as a function of rwa, predicting high stigma in high-rwa people and low stigma in low-rwa people. In study 2 (n = 93), we found that the motives indexed by sdo and rwa predicted how people responded to a biogenetic explanation of schizophrenia, tending to reinforce stigmatizing attitudes. We discuss the implications of these findings for efforts to reduce stigma. (C) 2015 elsevier ltd.

There has, however, been little work examining differences between subtypes of this disorder. We therefore aimed to compare illness perceptions of patients with non-epileptic seizures (nes) and those with functional weakness (fw) with matching neurological disease controls to examine their specificity. Methods: the illness perception questionnaire revised (ipq-r) was completed by patients with functional limb weakness, non-epileptic seizures and patients with neurological disease causing limb weakness and epilepsy in two separate case control studies. Results: patients with fw (n=107), nes (=40), epilepsy (n=34) and neurological disease causing limb weakness (ndlw) (n=46) were included in the analysis. Both fw and nes patients reported a low level of personal control, understanding of their symptoms and a tendency to reject a psychological causation of their symptoms. However nes patients rejected psychological causes less strongly than fw patients (p<.01). Patients with nes were also more likely to consider their treatment to be more effective (p<.01). None of these differences appeared in a similar comparison between patients with epilepsy and patients with ndlw. Conclusion: although patients with nes tended, as a group, to reject psychological factors as relevant to their. Symptoms, they did so less strongly than patients with functional limb weakness in these cohorts. This has implications for both the way in which these symptoms are grouped together but also the way in which treatment is approached. (C) 2015 elsevier inc.

The effects of different kinds of treatment information on stigmatizing perceptions, however, have yet to be compared directly. This study compared three different educational interventions focusing on medication, cbt, and psychodynamic psychotherapy in their potential to reduce stigmatizing perceptions towards people with schizophrenia. Methods: in an online experiment 178 participants received one of three psychoeducation texts that focused on medication, cbt or psychodynamic therapy. The effects on stereotypical beliefs about psychosis (dangerousness, unpredictability, blame, prognostic pessimism) and emotional responses towards people with schizophrenia (anxiety, anger, sympathy) were tested. Results: perceptions of dangerousness, unpredictability, and anxiety towards people with schizophrenia were reduced in all conditions. Prognostic pessimism was reduced only after reading the cbt information. Limitations: no neutral control group was included. The sample was not representative with respect to level of education or gender. Conclusions: stigmatizing perceptions may be reduced by receiving information about any type of treatment for psychosis and without producing negative side-effects, although this needs to be replicated in a controlled study. However, information on cbt seems most suitable to reduce stigma, since it was able to reduce prognostic pessimism. (C) 2016 elsevier ltd.

This fails to address the issue of whether a distinctive attributional style underpins the everyday talk of paranoid individuals. This study aimed to investigate whether attributional models of paranoid delusions applied to spontaneous attributions generated in the discourse of 12 paranoid and 12 non-paranoid speakers. Causal attributions for negative and positive life experiences were extracted from interview transcripts and rated using the content analysis of verbatim explanations (cave) technique. It was found that, as a proportion, paranoids made more attributions for negative events that were of an external-personal, stable and global nature (as attributional models would predict). They also made significantly more external-personal attributions for negative events and, in one of two datasets, showed a more external mean cave rating for negative events than the non-paranoid controls. This paper highlights important issues underlying the extraction of attributions from paranoid talk, and discusses the implications for attributional models of paranoia and future discourse-based research in this area.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Methods: australian women and men (n = 488) aged 1873 years were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: no information, neutral information, eating disorders emphasis and obesity emphasis. Mixed-model analysis of variance (anova) was used to compare the perceived severity of eating disorders and obesity (within-subjects factor), while also testing the effect of manipulating information, i.e., selectively emphasising the occurrence and adverse effects of one condition or the other (between-subjects factor), on perceptions of severity. Correlational analysis was used to examine associations between perceptions of severity and potential covariates, those covariates for which significant associations were observed being included as covariates in the anova. Results: eating disorders were perceived to be a more severe condition than obesity and the information manipulation was largely ineffective. Perceptions of the severity of both eating disorders and obesity were found to be associated with several covariates, including gender, body dissatisfaction, familiarity with and beliefs about the prevalence of eating disorders and beliefs about the causes of both eating disorders and obesity.

The present study also developed a new interview measure to quantify cognitive vulnerability for depression (specifically generality of causal attributions) in children and parents (the child cognitive style interview or ccsi, and the parent cognitive style interview or pcsi). The ccsi and pcsi were conducted with a subset of 60 mother-child dyads from the full sample in the current study. Findings from the present study indicate the ccsi and pcsi are positively related to questionnaire measures of negative cognitive style and with depressive symptoms. This study also provides evidence of positive associations between maternal and child cognitive vulnerability for depression as well as positive associations between maternal negative inferential feedback and child cognitive vulnerability for depression. Withdrawn and harsh parenting behaviors were not related to child cognitive vulnerability for depression. The current study also provides evidence that the associations between maternal variables (i.e., maternal negative inferential feedback and maternal generality of causal attributions) and child negative cognitive style are moderated by maternal current depressive symptoms, such that these associations are stronger at higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms. Finally, the current study provides an extension of prior findings of positive associations between cognitive vulnerability for depression and depressive symptoms in children and adults.

Both gender and low socioeconomic status have been related to depression and other common mental disorders, but their possible relationship to mental health literacy remains uncertain. Aim: the aim of this study was to determine the gender differences in knowledge, attitudes and practices towards mental illness in a sample of qatari and other arab expatriates residing in the state of qatar. Design: this is a cross-sectional survey. Setting: primary healthcare centres in the state of qatar. Subjects: a multi-stage sampling design was used and a representative sample of 3,300 qatari and other arab expatriates above 20 years of age were surveyed during the period from october 2008 to june 2009. Of the study sample of 3,300, 2,514 subjects (76.2\%) expressed their consent to participate. Methods: a questionnaire was designed to assess the gender difference in knowledge, attitudes and practice towards mental illness. This questionnaire was administered to the arab adult population above 20 years of age who were attending primary healthcare centres for various reasons other than mental illness. Face-to-face interviews were based on this questionnaire, which included variables on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude and practice towards mental illness. Results: of the study sample, 49.2\% were men and 50.8\% were women. Overall, the studied women held more to the cultural beliefs related to some aspects of mental illness. For example, more women than men believed that mental illness is due to possession by evil spirits. Also, nearly half of the women thought traditional healers can treat mental illness; this belief was significantly lower in men. Some of the women considered people with mental illness as dangerous; a belief also significantly lower in men. Men had a better attitude towards mental illness than women. Men were more willing to visit a psychiatrist for their emotional problems, while women preferred a traditional healer. Women were more afraid than men to talk to the mentally ill. Knowledge of common mental illnesses was generally poor, and it seemed to be lower among women. Men obtained more information than women from the media; women favoured healthcare staff more than men did. Conclusion: the study reveals that men had better knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards mental illness than women. Most of the women were afraid and not willing to keep friendships with the mentally ill. The results of this study underline the importance of information in changing people's attitude towards mental illness. Recognition of common mental disorders was very poor in men and women.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,MENTAL ILLNESS;KNOWLEDGE;QATARI;ARAB POPULATION;MIDDLE EAST;GENDER;Arabs,,

Half of the ss seeing the obese girl were led to believe that her obesity was due to a glandular disorder beyond her control. Ss rated the obese target as more self-indulgent and less self-disciplined than the normal-weight target, except when her obesity was said to have resulted from a glandular disorder. However, ss did not differentially attribute the confederate's task performance as a function of her weight or her perceived responsibility for it.

Cancer may be particularly threatening in indian culture due to the myths surrounding its cause and prognosis. This study explored the prevalence of euphemism use by indian patients and the relationship among euphemism use and illness cognitions, affect, health behaviour, and spontaneous self-affirmation (a behaviour associated with dealing with threat). Methods in total, 350 cancer patients in india were recruited to take part in a study exploring patients' experiences of, and thoughts about, having an illness. They responded to a questionnaire measuring illness perceptions, coping strategies, anxiety, depression, health behaviours, and spontaneous self-affirmation. Patients were asked what words they used to describe their illness; euphemism users were those who used a euphemism (ie, non-medical term) as a first word. Results about 51\% of patients used a euphemism as a first word. Those with less education, unskilled employment, a lower income, and more children were more likely to be euphemism users. Euphemism users reported (a) weaker illness perceptions (less personal control, greater reporting of symptoms, and less understanding of their condition), (b) less use of 3 of 14 coping strategies, (c) less likelihood of spontaneously self-affirming, and (d) fewer healthy eating days. Conclusions euphemism use in patients was not related to distress but was related to negative illness perceptions and use of fewer coping strategies, suggesting that we need further study about the extent to which euphemisms signal issues in psychological adaptation to cancer diagnosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,CANCER;COPING;EUPHEMISM;ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS;INDIA;ONCOLOGY;;SELF-AFFIRMATION,,

Design/methodology/approach a cross-sectional and exploratory instrument development design, using exploratory factor analysis, was employed. Findings the scale demonstrated good psychometric properties revealing three sub-scales: causes, consequences (mother); consequences (baby). Originality/value the findings implicate the pips as the first robust psychometric measure, which can be used to in the assessment of practitioner knowledge of the causes and consequences of pmh.

Yet voice-hearing is also an important aspect of lived experience, not always satisfactorily addressed by medical diagnosis and treatment. Looking across cultures and historical eras suggests a wide range of possible kinds of voice-hearing experience. The medieval period is of special interest because its thought world takes for granted the possibility of the supernatural and its theories of medicine and psychology offer powerful explanatory models for hallucinatory experience. Some of the greatest religious writing in the period is inspired by hearing voices, while its fictions also play creatively with voice-hearing.

It has not been explored before in england or using a qualitative design. In 2001, the established somerset health panels discussed attitudes to stress, depression and help seeking. A contemporary secondary analysis of the data originally collected during these focus groups was undertaken to review the mental health literacy framework's six component parts: ability to recognise specific disorders or different types of psychological distress, knowledge/beliefs about risk factors and causes, knowledge/beliefs about self-help interventions, knowledge/beliefs about professional help, attitudes which facilitate recognition/help seeking and knowledge of how to seek information. The results reveal that qualitative data added depth to what was known previously and provided a range of new insights into mental health literacy. There are challenges about recognising symptoms as they emerge, compared with 'with hindsight'; there is a subtle balance between stigma and barriers to help seeking; accumulated adversity is perceived to be a key risk factor; coping strategies and stigma are cross-cutting themes; the general practitioner has significant influence in facilitating access to appropriate support. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the mental health literacy framework provides an appropriate architecture for the range of research and discussion on this topic, where qualitative research adds depth to what was known previously, and new insights have been generated that indicate how the model might be adapted or expanded in the future.

Although it is commonly believed that a strong causal link exists between psychological stress and hypertension, as well with other factors, such as obesity, just what kind of empirical evidence supports this assumption is still controversial. The aim of the study is to investigate if perceived stress have any interference with intrarenal resistance and hence with mechanisms related to essential hypertension (eh) and if anxiety, depression, self efficacy and illness perception can account for perceived stress. Patients and methods. Obesity, insulin resistance (homa), doppler renal resistive index (r r i) and glomerular filtration rate (ger) are studied along with psychological stress measure (psm), illness perception questionnaire (ipq-r), generalized self-efficacy scale (gse) and hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads) in 119 hypertensive patients referred for stable lasting eh, and 150 normal controls. Lower salt/lower calories mediterranean diet, physical activity increase and smoking withdrawal counseling were provided. Results. By odds ratios, higher risk of eh is associated with greater perceived stress, older age, lower gfr, obesity, greater rri and insulin resistance. By multiple linear regression the most significant variable that accounts for higher rri are abdominal obesity and arterial pulse pressure; the only significant independent psychological variable that accounts for abdominal obesity are psm and identity ipq subscale. Self-efficacy anxiety and illness perception subscales (ipqr), accounts significantly for 62.0\% of the variance to psm, with possible effects on rri and on the pathophysiological hypertension cascade. Conclusion. Worst identity and treatment control perceptions of eh, and a lower self-efficacy are the main psychological factors accounting for a greater stress. Interventions aimed to reduce perceived stress can be warranted in eh.

The purpose of the present paper was to develop a new parent attribution for child eating scale (paces), then to examine how parent perceptions measured by the paces were associated with child variables and parent feeding practices. Participants included parents of 393 children from a hospital feeding clinic (68.2% boys; mean age = 55.4 months). Parents completed surveys to report children's demographic, medical, and feeding variables, three-point ratings for possible origins of these feeding problems, and their own use of nine child-feeding practices. Exploratory factor analysis of the parent ratings produced the 21-item paces with four dimensions: permissive parenting, medical treatments, oral problems, and vomiting fear. The paces showed acceptable goodness-of-fit, internal reliability, test-retest reliability, and support for its validity with expected correlations with child and parent variables. Multiple regression revealed that nine child variables (age, body mass index, gender, autism, gastrointestinal problems, neurological problems, oral motor problems, texture feeding problems, diet variety) explained 1941% of the variance in the four paces attributions, with oral motor problems significantly correlated with all of them (negatively with permissive parenting, positively with the other three), suggesting that its occurrence in combination with other child variables guides parent explanations for children's feeding problems. Multiple regression also found that many food choices was the only parent feeding practice significantly correlated with all four paces attributions (positively with permissive parenting, negatively with the other three), suggesting that it may be parents' primary response to attributions they develop for their children's feeding problems.

The study was specifically designed to ascertain whether the individuals identified with ad/hd during adulthood are at risk for insecure attachment and maladaptive attributional styles.

Participants were 50 men and 50 women ranging from 22 to 60 years of age. Participants were recruited through the behavioural research unit at alberta children's hospital, community agencies, advertisements, and word of mouth. Participants were interviewed and completed questionnaires that measured attachment style, attributional style, level of dissatisfaction with childhood, perception of risk of intimacy, level of social support satisfaction, self-esteem, perceived locus of control, history of childhood abuse, and the presence of anxiety and depression. Results suggested that there is a high incidence of child abuse with adults with ad/hd symptomatology who were not identified in childhood and that abuse was a significant predictor of childhood dissatisfaction and attachment style.

By offering us a model that enables us to conceive of such a differentiation he has made possible our monitoring the phenomena of our consulting room for their realizations. The theory of alpha-function and beta-elements has already proved itself fruitful for clinical observation in the area of communication of meaningful messages versus communication-like missiles of meaningless stuff. In work with psychotic children it has helped us to recognize their response to bombardment with emotional experiences for which they have no capacity either of containment or thought. It also gives us a basis for distinguishing between immaturity and psychosis. A report presented by mme eve cohen at a seminar held in paris in april 1982 throws some valuable light on the problem. Mme cohen's material concerned her patient, henri, aged twenty-six, who had had a breakdown while abroad after six years of aimless wanderings following upon his mother's departure from the family home to live with a lover with whom she had had a secret liaison for over ten years. I approach this material from two different angles: first, from the vantage point afforded by henri's presenting us with conscious processes for forming the symbols which we are more accustomed to see fully formed in dreams; second, from the point of view of the interaction of projection and introjection at the basic level of perception of self and objects.

Notably, findings identified recurrent and unique pathways connecting illness beliefs to the different indicators through meaning- and problem-focused coping strategies, avoidance and social support. Conclusions: the common sense model can represent a useful framework to be tested in rehabilitation programs, jointly addressing illness beliefs and coping resources for the promotion of psychological adjustment among persons with ms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS;COMMON SENSE MODEL;ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS;COPING;;WELL-BEING;DEPRESSION;Multiple Sclerosis,,

A total of forty final-year students were administered a modified des questionnaire consisting of twenty-five questions to determine the perceived causes of stress. Salivary cortisol levels during the first week of the semester, the final week of clinical training, and one hour before the final didactic examination were assessed. Baseline cortisol levels were significantly lower than the cortisol levels in the clinic, and both these values were significantly lower than the salivary cortisol levels before the examination (p < 0.001). Comparison of cortisol levels to the perceived sources of stress and demographic data collected showed that certain discrepancies may exist between the perceived and actual stress felt by dental students at different times in the academic semester.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,SALIVARY CORTISOL;STRESS;ANXIETY;DENTAL STUDENTS;SAUDI ARABIA;Biological Markers;Hydrocortisone,,

H. Ahrens and d. A. Haaga (see record [rid]1993-21524-001[/rid]) failed to support the prediction that expectancy mediates the relationship between attributional style for negative outcomes and anxiety, because the measure of expectancy failed to evaluate the type of expectations directly involved in the etiology of anxiety (i.e., threat expectancy). 104 college students (aged 1848 yrs) were interviewed, and their scores on measures of attributional style for positive and negative outcomes, threat expectancy regarding the prospect of future unemployment, and anxiety about future unemployment (unemployment anxiety) were obtained. Findings support the prediction that threat expectancy mediates the relationship between attributional style for negative outcomes and unemployment anxiety. There was also evidence consistent with the tripartite model of anxiety and depression that attributional style for positive outcomes is unrelated to the cognitive processes that generate anxiety.

The gastroparesis cardinal symptom index was used to measure gastroparesis symptom severity, qol was explored using the pagi-qol, illness perceptions were measured using the brief illness perception questionnaire, the carver brief cope scale assessed coping styles, and psychological distress was investigated using the dass21.; Results: structural equation modeling resulted in a final model with excellent fit. Gastroparesis symptom severity directly influenced illness perceptions (ß = .52, p < .001) and qol (ß = .30, p < .001). Illness perceptions directly influenced maladaptive coping (ß = - .64, p < .001), psychological distress (ß = - .32, p < .001), and qol (ß = .30, p = .01).

Furthermore, the impact supplement of the extended sdq surveys for perceived problems, impact, and burden. Objective this paper aims to examine the psychometric properties of the parent form and to investigate differences in the sdq scores for sociodemographic and socioeconomic subgroups. Patterns of association with other measures of mental health and descriptive comparison with the first normative sample are also reported. Methods within the bella study module of the german health interview and examination survey for children and adolescents (- ), a total of 2,406 children and adolescents aged 7-16 years as well as their parents answered the items of the sdq and the additional impact supplement. The internal consistency of scale responses was assessed via cronbach's a (alpha). Likert scale assumptions of sufficient and similar item-total correlation and item variance were investigated. The factorial validity of the sdq measurement model was tested by means of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Mean score differences between males and females, age groups (7-10 years vs. 11-16 years), and socioeconomic status groups (winkler index) were examined via anova. Results factor analysis provided an exact replication of the original five-factor sdq subscale structure. All subscales were sufficiently homogeneous. The mean total difficulties and sdq subscale scores of the bella sample did not differ from the first german normative data. Younger children were more impaired on various sdq scales than older children, girls were more emotionally affected, and boys showed more externalising problems. Conclusions the present study confirmed the validity and reliability of the parent-reported sdq scale structure. The sdq was found to be a valid and helpful questionnaire for use in the framework of an epidemiological survey.

Increasing mental health literacy has been proposed as a method to potentially facilitate help-seeking behaviour via enhanced problem recognition, but this assertion has yet to be examined empirically. In the present study, 165 university students were recruited to take part in an online mental health study. Participants were randomly assigned to either a stigma reduction or mental health literacy condition. In addition, half of the participants within each group were assigned to complete a mental health symptom self-assessment. Preintervention data on symptomatology, barriers to treatment, and attitudes about mental health were collected pre- and post- intervention. Overall, students reported generally low levels of stigma about mental health and positive beliefs about treatment efficacy. However, participants reported a number of treatment barriers including: questioning the seriousness of their symptoms and a desire to handle the problem on their own. Post-intervention analysis found that those participants with an untreated mental illness reported significantly poorer attitudes about seeking treatment compared to those who were treated. Amongst untreated participants, the mental health literacy condition, but not stigma reduction condition increased positive attitudes about seeking mental health services. In addition, support was found for an explanatory model such that those in the mental health literacy condition with an affirmative mental health self-assessment reported increased problem identification, which in turn, was positively associated with greater helpseeking attitudes and intentions. These results add to the evidence that mental health literacy should be considered a critical barrier to help-seeking amongst post-secondary students, at least for those with low levels of stigma.

In order to test the hypothesis that the drd2 a1 allele is only associated with alcoholism in subjects with elevated stress exposure, we examined the gene-stress interactional model in a sample of males of mayan descent in the olancho district of honduras. Ascertainment was based on an epidemiologic, observational cross-sectional design, and the study was approved by the institutional review board. A total of 309 adult males (age range 18-87 years) were interviewed by a physician or a public health nurse, blood samples were obtained for genetic studies, and participants were administered the short version of the michigan alcoholism screening test (s-mast) and the hispanic stress inventory (hsi). Three explanatory models were evaluated. The first model tested the effect of the demographic variables alone as predictors of mast scores, the second tested the effects of stress and drd2 genotypes separately, and the third tested the effect of the interaction between stress and the drd2 genotypes. Neither model 1 nor model 2 yielded significant results; neither mast scores nor hsi scores were found to be associated with drd2 genotypes. However, model 3 was confirmed reflecting a significant (p<.05) interaction between drd2 genotype and stress score as a predictor of mast score. Additionally, this difference was found to be largely accounted by the hsi occupational/economic stress score, which had a highly significant (p=.003) interaction with drd2 genotype as a predictor of mast score. This stress score was the only one of four that showed levels of stress as high as hsi scores in a us population. The mast scores of a2a2 genotype participants were found to be nearly identical in low stress and high stress participants, whereas the mast scores of a1a2 participants increased modestly with stress (p=.01) and that of a1a1 participants increased markedly with stress (p=.001). These findings support the hypothesis that drd2 genotype-phenotype associations depend on the magnitude of stress exposure, and they lend support to the view that variability in drd2 study outcomes may in part be explained by this gene-environment interaction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,ALLELES*;ALCOHOLISM/*GENETICS;POLYMORPHISM;GENETIC/*GENETICS;RECEPTORS;DOPAMINE D2/*GENETICS;STRESS;PHYSIOLOGICAL/*GENETICS;TAQ POLYMERASE/*GENETICS;ADOLESCENT;ADULT;AGED;80 AND OVER;ALCOHOLISM/PSYCHOLOGY;CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES;HUMANS;MALE;MIDDLE AGED;REGRESSION ANALYSIS;PHYSIOLOGICAL/PSYCHOLOGY;Alcoholics,,

Two types of maternal beliefs were examined: the causal attributions and the parenting goals. Contextual effects on maternal beliefs were also examined, as maternal responses have been found to vary for different child misbehaviors. Finally, recognizing that transactional and bidirectional models of development have emphasized the potential impacts of children on their parents and that both social behaviors and parents' beliefs about social behaviors vary for boys and girls, the relation of child gender to both maternal beliefs and adjustment to preschool was examined. Ss were 75 mother and their preschoolers (aged 2.55.8 yrs). Mothers completed measures including the child behavior vignettes. Five to 6 mo later, preschool teachers completed the preschool behavior questionnaire. Ss' parenting goals and causal attributions for misbehaviors varied according to child gender and the nature of the transgression. When mothers reported goals that were appropriate for transgression, teachers reported a greater display of behavior competence with peers while at preschool.

These causal attributions typically become the distinguishing principles on which the sub-categories are based. In this chapter, the authors discuss the topics of substance abuse and heterogeneity along with the epidemiology of drug abuse and risk factors such as antisociality. In addition to the research on the association between substance use disorders and antisociality, there is a large body of literature reporting connections with behavior disinhibition and affect dysregulation. In conclusion, this discussion illustrates the convergences in the research findings on risk factors that point to possible clusters having implications for further understanding the heterogeneity of substance abuse and the identification of drug abuse subtypes.

Although it is in principle descriptive, it also entails an explanatory dimension: single psychological symptoms are conceived as genetically arising from a holistic structure of personal experience, i.e., the patient's being-in-the-world - and of its dynamic unfolding over time. Yet both classical and current phenomenological approaches tend to identify the essential disorder or ``trouble generateur'' (minkowski) of mental illness within the individual, thereby neglecting the relevance of the social context not only for the emergence of symptoms but also for their treatment. The work of wolfgang blankenburg on schizophrenia represents a noteworthy approach to overcome this individualistic tendency. He introduced the concept of ``loss of common sense'' as the structural core of schizophrenic experience and being-in-the-world and he considered the social and most importantly familial context for the emergence of schizophrenic experience. By accounting not only for personal experience but also for interactional structures of families and social milieus in which experience is embedded, blankenburg thereby offered ways to combine phenomenological and systemic explanations of mental disorders. Beside his most renowned work on ``the loss of common sense,'' in this paper we also present his family studies of young persons with schizophrenia, which have so far received little if no attention. We thus discuss the different ways in which blankenburg expanded the phenomenological approach into a more systemic and social direction. We then link blankenburg's work with current systemic explanatory models of schizophrenia and explore the clinical and scientific implications of this link. Finally, we call for further research on the synergy effects between the two.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,PHENOMENOLOGICAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;SYSTEMIC THERAPY;PSYCHOSIS;;PHENOMENOLOGICAL SOCIOLOGY;THERAPY OF PSYCHOSIS,,

Treatment default was seen as a result of multilevel factors related to the patient (lack of means, being a migrant worker, distance to treatment site, poor understanding of treatment, drug use, mental illness), medical team (high patient load, low motivation, lack of resources for tracking defaulters), treatment organization (poor communication between treatment sites, no systematic strategy for patient education or tracking, incomplete record keeping), and health care system and society. Tailored recommendations for low- and higher-cost interventions are provided.; Conclusions: interventions to enhance tb treatment completion should take into account the local context and multilevel factors that contribute to default.

Recognition of mental disorders, as the first step to seeking help from professional sources, has been well studied in developed countries, yet little is known about the situation in rural areas of developing countries like china. The purpose of the study is to understand the recognition of depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse and its predictive factors in a chinese rural sample methods: face-to-face interviews were conducted on a representative rural adult sample in a cross-sectional study in china (n = 2052). Respondents were presented with three vignettes depicting depression, anxiety and alcohol abuse and asked to label the disorder and its cause to assess their recognition of the three mental disorders. They also completed the patient health questionnaire (phq-9), the generalized anxiety disorder scale (gad-7), and the alcohol use disorders identification test (audit) to assess their current mental health status. Results: the alcohol abuse vignette was more frequently attributed as a mental problem than the depression vignette and anxiety vignette. The correct labeling rate was 16.1 \% in the depression vignette, 15.5 \% in the anxiety vignette, and 58.2 \% in the alcohol vignette. Higher education is the common and also strongest factor positively predicting the recognition of all three vignettes. Beyond that, being female is an independent predictor of correct recognition of alcohol abuse, while recognition of depression and anxiety were positively predicted by younger age. Conclusions: lower recognition of depression and anxiety as compared to alcohol abuse confirms the importance and need to increase the public's awareness and knowledge about common mental disorders. Recognition of common mental disorders could be improved through general public campaign and education, while paying attention to the unique predictive factors for each specific disorder and implement targeted intervention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY;RECOGNITION;MENTAL DISORDERS;RURAL;CHINESE;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section;Anxiety;Alcoholics,,

The resulting 10-item scale (the pid-5-ors) produced adequate-to-good estimates of internal reliability and was significantly correlated with the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory-2 restructued form (mmpi-2-rf) overreporting validity scales, providing evidence of concurrent validity. The criterion validity of the pid-5-ors was demonstrated in an analog simulation design study. More specifically, university students instructed to overreport (n = 80) scored substantially higher on the pid-5-ors relative to both a group of genuine psychiatric patients and students instructed to complete the pid-5 under standard (honest) instructions (n = 161); the effect size magnitudes associated with these differences were large. Classification accuracy analyses further revealed that high scores on the pid-5-ors were associated with high specificity (and thus, low rates of false positive classifications) in differentiating overreporters from genuine patients, with sensitivity being somewhat weaker.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,PERSONALITY INVENTORY FOR DSM-5;VALIDITY SCALES;RESPONSE BIAS;;OVERREPORTING;MALINGERING;Personality Inventory,,

From our data, there was consensus about what constituted a serious mental disorder. However, the other disorders were not seen as mental disorders. Although there was an acknowledgement of biological and social causes of serious mental illness, the dominant view was that of supernatural causes.

rayyan-470329489,The Influence Of Meaning Making On Distress And Well-Being Following Spinal Cord Injury: A Cross-Sectional Examination With Military Veterans,2009,1,1,NA,,,,,DEROON-CASSINI TA,,,,,"There are many risk factors that have been linked with distress following a traumatic spinal cord injury. Peritraumatic variables such as perceived life threat and dissociation have been associated with an increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd). The conservation of resources theory proposes that it is the loss of resources (e.g., material possessions, personal characteristics, finances) that contributes to both depression and ptsd. Appraisal processes such as global and situational meaning making have been documented as both inhibiting and facilitating posttrauma psychological health. However, research has not been conducted that combines the injury characteristics, resource loss, and meaning making influences on psychological outcomes with individuals who have experienced a spinal cord injury. This study proposes and evaluates a new model of posttrauma psychological outcomes that is based on these identified traumatogenic factors by emphasizing the individual perspective through narratives. Eighty-five spinal cord injured veterans completed semi-structured interviews assessing perceived loss of physical, personal, and energy resources; level of global meaning; ptsd; depression; and psychological well-being. Objective ratings of level and completeness of spinal cord injury were retrieved from medical records to calculate injury severity. Additionally, narratives were generated in response to open-ended questions about meaning and impact of the injury, identity and autobiography formation, and coping efficacy. This study utilized a mixed-method approach that involved a grounded theory qualitative evaluation of situational meaning making narratives. Also, quantitative analyses were used to investigate the influence of injury severity, loss of resources, and meaning making on psychological outcomes post-injury. Results revealed that the variables of interest did not differ across time since injury. Resource loss was positively associated with depression and ptsd and negatively associated with psychological well-being. However, the severity of the spinal cord injury was not associated with psychological outcomes, even though this directly relates to functionality. Global meaning and resource loss were significant predictors of psychological outcomes. Finally, consistent situational meaning making themes were generated describing causal attributions, degree of life change, identity loss and integration, and post-injury growth. Implications of these findings related to factors that are associated with quality of life and human resiliency are discussed, as are suggestions for psychological intervention.

However, this potential linkage between subjective self-other attribution (explicit agency) and automatic self-monitoring of an action (implicit agency) has not been examined fully. The present study included two experiments conducted with the same group of healthy participants (n = 48) in order to examine explicit (exp. 1) and implicit (exp. 2) measures of the sense of agency in speech. Exp. 1 suggested that participants who tend not to attribute a fed-back voice to themselves (the other-attribution group) might have a stronger tendency toward auditory hallucinations, as measured by the auditory hallucination experience scale 17 (ahes-17). Furthermore, the results of exp. 2 suggested that this other-attribution group might not utilize auditory feedback during speech production, indicating the expected link between explicit and implicit agency.

A systematic search and review of the literature were conducted, and 13 articles were selected. Five explanatory models of internalized stigma were identified: the socio-cognitive model; the model of personal discrimination, internalized stigma, and intention to participate in collective actions; the internalized stigma model; the socio-cognitive-behavioral model; and the causality model of self-stigma-related factors in people with anxiety disorders. The models were found to include psychosocial, self-concept, and mental health variables. Notably, while the socio-cognitive model was the most tested, only some of the associated studies were fully validated. The model of personal discrimination, internalized stigma, and intention to participate in collective actions was fully validated; the rest were partially validated. Thus, it was concluded that models of internalized stigma explain this phenomenon from psychosocial variables such as acceptance and application of stereotypes. Cognitive-behavioral strategies, peer support, disclosure, and psychoeducational strategies are the most relevant for reducing internalized stigma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,EXPLANATORY MODELS;INTERNALIZED STIGMA;SELF-STIGMA;MENTAL DISORDERS;;PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES;Mental Disorders,,

Caregivers play a critical role in the outcome of mental illness in their children, yet there is limited research on effective means to engage caregivers in the ed and provide the support they need. Our aim was to determine caregivers' perceptions about mental illness in their children, specifically regarding suicidality and depression, the impact of the children's mental health on the caregiver, and barriers to and facilitators of treatment. Methods guided by qualitative descriptive methodology, we conducted semistructured, open-ended interviews with a purposive sample of english-speaking primary caregivers of children 6 to 17 years old who presented with suicidal ideations or behaviors to 1 urban pediatric ed. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and conventional content analysis was performed. Results the participants (n = 20) were largely single ethnic-racial minority mothers. Content analysis identified 6 categories: caregivers' definitions of mental health, depression, and suicidality; perceived causes of mental illness; difficulty in identification of mental illness; the influence of the mental illness on caregivers; a complex network of communication among involved parties that resulted in the child's ed visit, as well as barriers to and facilitators of treatment. Conclusions we identified several categories that encapsulate caregivers' perceptions of mental health and mental illness in their children and its effect on them. Future research should explore how inner-city eds might partner with schools and trusted community-based organizations to enhance caregiver knowledge, reduce obstacles to care, increase screening for at-risk youth and implement strategies to optimize outcomes for children with depression and suicidal ideations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH;ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS;CAREGIVER;ATTITUDES;QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE;Caregivers,,
rayyan-470329497,Spiritual Beliefs In Bipolar Affective Disorder: Their Relevance For Illness Management,2003,1,1,JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,,,,,MITCHELL L and ROMANS S,,,,,"Background: there has been growing interest in investigating religion as a relevant element in illness outcome. Having religious beliefs has been shown repeatedly to be associated with lessened rates of depression. Most of the limited published research has been restricted to elderly samples. Religious coping is thought to play a key role in religion's effects. Strangely, psychiatric research has neglected this area. Methods: a questionnaire covering religious, spiritual and philosophical beliefs and religious practice was given to a sample of patients with bipolar affective disorder in remission. Results: most patients often held strong religious or spiritual beliefs (78\%) and practised their religion frequently (81.5\%). Most saw a direct link between their beliefs and the management of their illness. Many used religious coping, and often religio-spiritual beliefs and practice put them in conflict with illness models (24\%) and advice (19\%) used by their medical advisors. Limitations: this was a cross-sectional design without a control group and thus it is not possible to determine causal associations from the data set. Conclusions: religio-spiritual ideas are of great salience to many patients with bipolar disorder and shape the ways in which they think about their illness. Many reported experiencing significant paradigm conflict in understanding and managing their illness between medical and their spiritual advisors. These data suggest that the whole area of religion and spirituality is directly relevant to people living with a chronic psychiatric illness and should be firmly on the discussion agenda of clinicians working with patients with bipolar disorder.

Prior research has identified three distinct groups of children participating in the above phenomenon: bullies, passive victims and aggressive victims (or bully-victims). These groups have different profiles in their intra-individual (personal), as well as their family environments. The most important personal characteristics refer to their temperament, the degree of psycho-pathology issues, gender and age. Further, differences have been found in terms of attitudes such as attributions, and in terms of being different in a way that sets the individual apart from a mainstream group. Regarding family parameters, factors such as parental involvement and parental style, as well as parental depression have been shown to be related to child bullying and victimization at school. Among the many explanatory models that have been suggested, very popular are recently the transactional models, proposing that a bi-directional influence exists between parents and children.

The four mediating types of threats, which influence prejudice according to itt are: intergroup anxiety, negative stereotyping, realistic and symbolic threats. In this study, the itt-model was tested using structural equation modeling on data collected in sample of 187 dutch employees. Two alternative explanatory models are proposed in which, first intergroup anxiety and then negative stereotyping mediate the relation between the other itt threats and prejudice. The data show a good fit with the model in which negative stereotypes are considered as mediator variable.

The present research aimed at analyzing depression from a socio-psychological perspective, focusing on the role of causal attributions on the origins of depressive disorders. Therefore, a model of depression is suggested in which the role of social factors such as stressful life events and coping strategies, social support, alienation and self-esteem are considered. The results are consistent with the attributional style hypothesis, as well as with the attribution model of depression. However, the results also point to the fact that the attributional style is not significantly associated to depression when taking into consideration the role of other social variables.

Design and methods: a cross-sectional design was employed. Parents of a child with autism spectrum disorder (asd) were asked to complete the lay-beliefs about autism questionnaire (lba-q) and answer questions about treatments used. Only items inquiring about a cause of autism were retained for analysis. Series of forward stepwise logistic regressions were performed with each treatment as dependent variable and the scores given to each of the cba items as independent variables. Results: 78 parents were included. The most strongly held causal beliefs were brain abnormalities and genetic factors. Parents who had more beliefs in the causal role of very early traumatic experiences were less likely to use behavior therapy and pecs. Higher beliefs in illness during pregnancy increased the odds of medication use. Stronger beliefs on the role of food allergy were associated with higher use of detoxification treatments, special diets, and vitamins. On the contrary, these beliefs reduced the odds of drug use. Conclusions: causal beliefs are associated with treatment choices. Such preliminary results highlight the value of continued studies, not only to establish the causal nature of these associations, but also to demonstrate the utility of modifying such beliefs for both parents' and child's benefits. Identifying parents' beliefs about their child's illness may be an important step in formulating interventions facilitating appropriate care. (C) 2011 elsevier ltd.

The central concerns of medical/psychiatric anthropology have been to understand popular categories of and systems for classification of illness, to examine the relationship of illness categories to cultural understandings of the body, and to interpret the role of categories of illness in mediating between the personal and social spheres. At the same time, the paper also discusses the interplay of popular categories and psychiatric diagnoses. This paper examines the multiple experiences of nervios among puerto ricans in puerto rico and new york city. Our contention is that nervios is more than a diffuse idiom of distress, and that there are different categories and experiences of nervios which provide insights into how distress is experienced and expressed by puerto ricans and point to different social sources of suffering. The data in this paper come from the responses to a series of open-ended questions which tapped into people's general conceptions of nervios and ataques de nervios. These questions were incorporated into follow-up interviews to an epidemiological study of the mental health of adults in puerto rico.

It was hypothesized that depressive changes should most likely occur in ss with a preexisting insidious as and who failed, in their own eyes, on the exam.

Public surveys show high recognition of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) in relation to military contexts, but this has not been investigated with other sources of trauma.; Methods: a self-selecting sample of 2960 participants from uk and ireland completed an online survey. Participants viewed one of three vignettes that described either a male or female character experiencing identical ptsd symptoms, that differed only by trauma source (military combat, industrial accident, sexual assault). Participants were asked to state i) whether a mental health problem was being experienced, ii) what it was, and iii) what help should be sought.; Results: trauma type was a key predictor of classification as a mental health problem, correct identification of ptsd, and help-seeking suggestions. For participants shown the military scenario the odds of recognising ptsd were 5.2 times higher than for those shown the sexual assault vignette, and 2.2 times higher than for those shown the accident scenario. Age (younger), gender (female), education (university), and personal mental health experience were additional significant predictors of higher recognition of ptsd.; Limitations: reasons for failing to recognise a mental health problem/ptsd were not explored. The online convenience sampling method may limit generalisability of results.; Conclusions: recognition of ptsd is significantly affected by trauma source. The data confirmed the pervasive association with military combat and suggest under-recognition of ptsd from other traumas, particularly sexual assault.

The sample consisted of 73 students (unselected for at-risk features) from a single elementary school. The facilitator (a school counselor) of the self-determination intervention was randomly assigned to treatment and control classrooms; the students remained as an intact group in their classrooms. Pretest and posttest measures assessing explanatory style, depressive symptoms, and self-determination were completed by the students. Posttest comparisons for the treatment and control group indicated a nonsignificant difference for the three dependent measures: explanatory style, depressive features, and self-determination. However, the posttest treatment group mean showed (nonsignificant) evidence of a benefit for the treatment group on the measures of depressive features, and self-determination (gp). Pretest to posttest change for the treatment group children was not statistically significant in the areas of explanatory style, depressive features, and level of self-determination. However, the means of the treatment group showed (nonsignificant) unproved scores from pretest to posttest on explanatory style, depressive symptoms, and in self-determination (gp and sn subscales). Post hoc statistical analyses found two statistically significant findings: (1) pretest and posttest treatment group distributions showed decreasing levels of depressive features from pretest to posttest for the children; and, (2) the number of at-risk children for depression in the treatment group decreased from pretest to posttest, while the number of at-risk for depression children in the control group increased from pretest to posttest. These results indicate that there is still a great deal that is not known about how this self-determination intervention effects the explanatory style, depressive features, and the level of self-determination for sixth-grade students. However, the post hoc findings did show that at-risk children did benefit in decreasing their depressive symptoms. Hence, additional research is needed in order to further examine the relationship between self-determination and its effect on attributional style and symptoms of depression.

Significant symptomatic differences between the depressed cfs group and dcs were observed for features such as self-esteem and guilt as well as attribution of illness. All the cfs groups tended to attribute their symptoms to external causes, whereas the dcs experienced inward attribution. This suggests that an outward style of attribution protects the depressed cfs patients from cognitive changes associated with low mood but at the expense of greater vulnerability toward somatic symptoms such as fatigue.

Two studies found differences between maladaptive and high personal standards perfectionism in the functionality of counterfactuals and variables relevant to behavior regulation. Maladaptive but not personal standards perfectionism predicted making more upward counterfactuals after recalling a negative event and was linked to a variety of negative markers of achievement. Maladaptive perfectionism was associated with making controllable, subtractive, and less specific counterfactuals. High personal standards perfectionism moderated the effects of maladaptive perfectionism on counterfactual controllability.

Twice a week for up to 10 weeks, participants described the events that occurred each day and provided measures of their daily affect, self-esteem, and depressogenic thinking. Participants also provided trait-level measures of affect, depression, and self-esteem. Measures of daily well-being representing each model covaried jointly and independently with daily negative and positive events. Positive events buffered the effects of negative events on daily self-esteem and daily depressogenic thinking, whereas there was no buffering effect for daily affect. More depressed people were more reactive to positive events, and those higher in trait pa were less reactive to negative events. Buffering effects for self-esteem were more pronounced for those with lower trait self-esteem, and buffering effects for daily depressogenic adjustment were more pronounced for those with higher trait negative affect. The results suggest that affect- and self-based models provide complementary perspectives on relationships between psychological well-being and daily events.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,DAILY EVENT;SELF-ESTEEM VARIABILITY;MULTILEVEL MODELING,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate factors, including explanatory models (patient perspectives) of illness, associated with common mental disorders and with frequency of consultation among women of indian origin in primary care. The investigation was conducted in a general practice in west london with a large indian population. Consecutive woman attenders of indian descent were screened with the general health questionnaire-12 to identify probable cases of psychiatric morbidity. 100 patients were interviewed with the revised clinical interview schedule (cis-r), a specific tool for the diagnosis of common mental disorders, and the short explanatory model interview, which elicits the individual's conceptualization of his or her illness. Those patients who satisfied cis-r criteria were classified as `cases', the others as `controls'. Common mental disorders were documented in 30\% of patients. The general practitioner's diagnosis of common mental disorders had a sensitivity of 17\% and a specificity of 91\%. Individuals with common mental disorders had a higher frequency of consultation (p=0.017), were less likely to see depression as an indication for medical intervention and were more likely to withhold some of their concerns from the general practitioner. Incorrect diagnosis by the gp was most likely to occur when patients did not disclose all their complaints. These associations were all statistically significant after adjustment for possible confounders by multiple linear and logistic regression. Women of indian origin in this sample had rates of common mental disorders similar to those in other uk populations. Differing conceptualizations of common mental disorders may contribute to their underrecognition in women of indian origin.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Mental Disorders;Referral and Consultation,,

Based on high rates of non-converters to psychosis, especially in children and adolescents, it was suggested that chr criteria were: (1) pluripotential; (2) a transdiagnostic risk factor; and (3) simply a severity marker of mental disorders rather than specifically psychosis-predictive. If any of these three alternative explanatory models were true, their prevalence should differ between persons with and without mental disorders, and their severity should be associated with functional impairment as a measure of severity. Aim to compare the prevalence and severity of chr criteria/symptoms in children and adolescents of the community and inpatients. Methods in the mainly cross-sectional examinations, 8-17-year-old community subjects (n = 233) randomly chosen from the population register of the swiss canton bern, and inpatients (n = 306) with primary diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 86), eating disorder (n = 97), anxiety including obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 94), or autism spectrum disorder (n = 29), not clinically suspected to develop psychosis, were examined for chr symptoms/criteria. Positive items of the structured interview for psychosis-risk syndromes (sips) were used to assess the symptomatic ultra-high-risk criteria, and the schizophrenia proneness instrument, child and youth version (spi-cy) was used to assess the 14 basic symptoms relevant to basic symptom criteria. We examined group differences in frequency and severity of chr symptoms/criteria using chi(2) tests and nonparametric tests with cramer's v and rosenthal's r as effect sizes, and their association with functioning using correlation analyses. Results the 7.3\% prevalence rate of chr criteria in community subjects did not differ significantly from the 9.5\% rate in inpatients. Frequency and severity of chr criteria never differed between the community and the four inpatient groups, while the frequency and severity of chr symptoms differed only minimally. Group differences were found in only four chr symptoms: suspiciousness/persecutory ideas of the sips [chi(2) (4) = 9.425; p = 0.051, cramer's v = 0.132; and z = -4.281, p < 0.001; rosenthal's r = 0.184], and thought pressure [chi(2) (4) = 11.019; p = 0.026, cramer's v = 0.143; and z = -2.639, p = 0.008; rosenthal's r = 0.114], derealization [chi(2) (4) = 32.380; p < 0.001, cramer's v = 0.245; and z = -3.924, p < 0.001; rosenthal's r = 0.169] and visual perception disturbances [chi(2) (4) = 10.652; p = 0.031, cramer's v = 0.141; and z = -2.822, p = 0.005; rosenthal's r = 0.122] of the spi-cy. These were consistent with a transdiagnostic risk factor or dimension, i.e., displayed higher frequency and severity in inpatients, in particular in those with eating, anxiety/obsessive-compulsive and autism spectrum disorders. Low functioning, however, was at most weakly related to the severity of chr criteria/symptoms, with the highest correlation yielded for suspiciousness/persecutory ideas (kendall's tau = -0.172, p < 0.001). Conclusion the lack of systematic differences between inpatients and community subjects does not support suggestions that chr criteria/symptoms are pluripotential or transdiagnostic syndromes, or merely markers of symptom severity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS;RISK ASSESSMENT;MINORS;COMMUNITY;INPATIENTS;;PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING;Psychotic Disorders,,

Moreover, the neural representation of trait information is thought to be located in the ventral part of the medial prefrontal cortex (vmpfc). In order to verify this latter finding, this study compared the performance of 8 patients with hypoperfusion of the vmpfc, 10 with hypoperfusion excluding the vmpfc and 15 healthy controls on trait and causal attribution questionnaires consisting of several events presented in brief written scenarios. We also investigated whether vmpfc hypoperfusion influenced the experienced intensity of the negative or positive valence of the events. Our results showed that patients with ventral hypoperfusion performed significantly worse on trait attributions in comparison with the non-vmpfc group and healthy controls. All groups performed equally well on causal attributions. These findings support previous research suggesting that the vmpfc is critically involved in enduring trait attribution, but not in temporary causal attribution. Considering the emotional experience of valence, the findings showed more intense valence ratings for negative events and persons. This confirms the role of the vmpfc in the modulation and regulation of negative emotions.

Many participants felt confused, at least initially, about the source of their fatigue, although most offered their hiv disease as a possible cause. However, many who did so also believed it was caused in part by other, generally less threatening causes, such as age, overexertion, or excess weight.

Participants at a large southern university (n = 139; 78% female; average age 19.77) received bogus screening results indicating high depression risk, then viewed an explanation of depression etiology (fixed biological vs. Malleable) before receiving a treatment referral (antidepressant vs. Psychotherapy). Participants accepted the cover story at face value, but some expressed doubts about the screening task's ability to properly assess their individual depression. Within the skeptics, those given a fixed biological explanation for depression were relatively unwilling to accept either treatment, but those given a malleable explanation were much more willing to accept psychotherapy. Importantly, differences in skepticism were not due to levels of actual depressive symptoms. The present findings indicate that information about the malleability of depression may have a protective effect for persons who otherwise would not accept treatment.

Evidence from general population studies challenge some assumptions, suggesting that measurement difficulties might relate to the characteristics of mental health samples, rather than measurement itself. This paper assesses the impact of mental illness on qol and its measurement, examining whether the life-conditions, opportunities and qol of different mental health-status groups vary, and if explanatory models of domain-specific and global qol differ. Objective life-conditions, access to life- opportunities and subjective qol were assessed over 2 years, using the same methodology in severe mental illness (smi; n = 149 (baseline)/ n = 126 (follow-up)), common mental disorder (cmd; n = 794/354) and no disorder (n = 1119/583) groups. Objective life-conditions were worse in the smi group than in mentally healthy population and cmd groups, but the opportunities available to the smi group were no more restricted than the cmd group. Subjective qol ratings reflected this; smi group scores were lower than the healthy population and in some life- domains the cmd group. Models of qol suggested that life-quality was explained differently in the three groups.

In this study, we examined whether memory and executive functioning changed over the course of treatment and which clinical variables were associated with change. Designneuropsychological assessments were administered at baseline and endpoint of a randomized controlled trial as secondary outcome. Methodstrauma survivors (n=88) diagnosed with ptsd received trauma-focused psychotherapy within a 17-week randomized controlled trial. Neuropsychological tests were the california verbal learning test, rivermead behavioural memory test, stroop color word test, and trail making test. Resultssignificant, small- to medium-sized improvements in verbal memory, information processing speed, and executive functioning were found after trauma-focused psychotherapy (cohen's d 0.16-0.68). Greater ptsd symptom decrease was significantly related to better post-treatment neurocognitive performance (all p<.005). Patients with comorbid depression improved more than patients with ptsd alone on interference tasks (p<.01). No differences emerged between treatment conditions and between patients on serotonergic antidepressants and those who were not. Conclusionsthis study suggests that neurocognitive deficits in ptsd can improve over the course of trauma-focused psychotherapy and are therefore at least partly reversible. Improvements over treatment are in line with previous neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies and effect sizes exceed those of practice effects. Future research should determine whether these changes translate into improved functioning in the daily lives of the patients. Practitioner points patients with ptsd have difficulties performing verbal memory tasks (e.g., remembering a grocery list, recall of a story) and executive functioning tasks (e.g., shifting attention between two tasks, ignoring irrelevant information to complete a task). Verbal memory, information processing speed, and executive functioning significantly improved in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder over the course of trauma-focused psychotherapy. Improvements were equal in size for two different trauma-focused psychotherapies (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy and brief eclectic psychotherapy for ptsd). Medium-sized effects were found for recall of a story, whereas effects in other aspects of verbal memory, information processing speed, and executive functioning were small-sized. No causal attributions can be made because we could not include a control group without treatment for ethical reasons. Findings may be more reflective of patients who completed treatment than patients who prematurely dropped out as completers were overrepresented in our sample.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,"POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER;VERBAL MEMORY;EXECUTIVE FUNCTION;;TRAUMA-FOCUSED PSYCHOTHERAPY;TREATMENT OUTCOME;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Psychotherapy;Memory",,

Statistically, there were no significant differences in the smsf score between the two groups on admission and at the time of discharge. The programme had no effect on the readmission rate. However, the smsf score of the participation group significantly improved from the start of the programme to patient discharge. Furthermore, improvement of depressive symptoms, feeling of recovery and adherence were found in the participation group. The programme seemed to provide a psychotherapeutic effect for the patients and promoted cooperation with occupational therapist and other specialists in the hospital. The efficacy of psychoeducation in preventing recurrence of depression remains to be demonstrated, and methods of investigating effective approaches for this purpose need to be considered in the future.

Explanatory models of illness beliefs and behaviors suggest that an individual's beliefs about a disorder and its treatment will influence their adherence. Given that beliefs about medications may influence adherence to antidepressants, we examined beliefs about medications in relation to antidepressant adherence in a primary care sample. Objective: the purpose of this report is to 1) describe beliefs about medication in primary care patients prescribed antidepressants for depression; 2) examine the factor structure of the beliefs about medicines questionnaire (bmq) and compare it with the previously reported factor structure of the bmq in medical conditions; and 3) examine the association of medication beliefs with self-reported medication adherence. Results: factor analysis indicates that the bmq is valid in a sample of primary care patients receiving treatment for depression and has a similar factor structure to that obtained in samples of patients with chronic medical conditions. Beliefs about medications are significantly associated with self-reported adherence. Severity of depressive symptoms and specific concerns about antidepressants are significantly associated with self-reported medication-taking behavior. Findings suggest that in addition to telling patients how to take their medications, primary care physicians should also educate patients about the short-and long-term effects of the medication, how the medication works, and that antidepressants are not addictive.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,ADHERENCE;DEPRESSION;ANTIDEPRESSANTS;PRIMARY CARE;Antidepressive Agents,,

The usefulness and great heuristic value of this newly created diagnosis are undisputed today. In spite of its obvious qualities, there have always been conceptual difficulties with the diagnosis, mainly concerning the crucial a-criterion. The a-criterion of ptsd (i.e. The trauma criterion according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders) represents the conceptual core of the diagnosis. It is much owed to social and political stances of its original authors and stipulates a monocausal etiology of the disorder. This is in fact inadequate and misleading. Furthermore, the a-criterion is tautologic and therefore dispensable. It may be more appropriate to define ptsd strictly on the basis of descriptive, phenomenological terms and to omit the a-criterion, in order to avoid useless confusions about causal attribution.

In this dissertation, we compared explanatory models of substance use including the self-medication hypothesis, the social learning model, and the rebound hypothesis to characterize the association between anxiety and alcohol use in groups with various levels of experience with drinking. Additionally, we included depression symptoms in our studies to assess whether the relationships we found between anxiety and alcohol were unique or similar to those found with other forms of negative affect. In chapter 1, we investigated the relationships between several types of social anxiety symptoms and the onset of alcohol use in middle school students. We found that social anxiety significantly predicted initiation of drinking at both extremely high and low levels, and sex differences were observed. Chapter 2 follows with an analysis of the impact of social anxiety, depression, and alcohol expectancies on youths' drinking. We found that the self-medication hypothesis characterized the relationship between depression symptoms and drinking behavior, while the relationship between social anxiety and alcohol use was explained by social learning theory. Chapters 3 and 4 examined alcohol and drug use relapse characteristics in an adolescent substance use disordered treatment sample. In chapter 3 we found that compared to youth with only a substance use disorder, comorbid youth relapsed more often and more rapidly after treatment. In chapter 4, anxiety symptoms were more likely reported to improve than worsen immediately after relapse and in the two weeks following the relapse episode, indicating support for the self-medication hypothesis, while depression symptoms worsened in youth who relapsed with stimulants, which is consistent with a rebound effect. Chapter 5 is a replication of the study in chapter 4 with adults post-treatment for substance use disorders, with and without comorbid psychopathology. Unlike in the adolescent sample, almost no adults reported improvements in any psychiatric symptoms following relapse, however depression symptoms were rated as worsening more than anxiety symptoms.

Although depression can be successfully treated, 75% of americans do not receive care. Treatment rates among latinos immigrants are significantly lower than non-immigrant latinos and non-hispanic whites. Known factors for mental health-care disparities such as poverty, insurance coverage, language barriers, and access to specialty mental health services in latino neighborhoods do not fully explain the differences in treatment rates. Significant, but poorly understood factors influencing depression treatment among latinos in the united states are lack of culturally congruent care, low mental health literacy, and stigma. Even though churches are a major source of health information, social and spiritual support for latinos, the conceptualization of culturally congruent care rarely addresses religious beliefs. Therefore, one strategy to reduce disparities in depression treatment is to partner with churches to address faith-based stigma. Community-based participatory research is recognized as a methodology particularly well suited for creating successful culturally targeted interventions. The purpose of this article is to describe the process of creating a faith-based mental health literacy intervention in the caribbean latino community using the principles of community-based participatory research.

The present study tested that prediction with 227 undergraduates by determining whether the content of ss' attributional styles at 1 point in time predicted the severity of their depressive response (multiple affect adjective check list) to receiving a low grade on an exam at a subsequent time. Consistent with the prediction, ss with an internal or global attributional style for negative outcomes at time 1 experienced a depressive response when confronted with a low grade; ss with an external or specific attributional style were invulnerable to this response. In contrast to results for the internality and globality dimensions, ss' scores along the stability attribution dimension were not correlated with the severity of their depressive response to the low grade. In the absence of a negative life event, ss' generalized tendencies to make internal or global attributions for negative outcomes at time 1 were not significantly correlated with their subsequent changes in depressive mood, although there was a nonsignificant positive correlation between severity of depressive response and the tendency to make global attributions for negative outcomes at time l.

After having reporting their swb level, 240 participants from two age groups (young adults and their parents) were asked to indicate the extent to which they based their swb judgment on different types of comparisons [social, temporal and telic (what i would like it to be) comparisons]. The participants also indicated if they perceived various causes (internal and external) to be responsible for their current level of well-being. Results indicated that social comparisons were not perceived as being important in swb evaluation. Telic comparison was reported to be more used than other comparison types by young adults, but related negatively to the swb level. Participants attributed their well-being more to internal than external causes. However, the more strongly they could ascertain various causes (internal and external) to explain their swb, the higher their swb level was. It is suggested that individuals' accounts of the processes involved in their personal well-being evaluation could be a useful approach to understand and promote the experience of happiness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Cognition,,

Consistent with the diathesis-stress hypothesis, hierarchical linear modeling revealed that attributional style moderated the impact of daily hassles on depressive symptoms. Negative attributional style predicted greater depressive symptom reactivity in response to stress. The results also indicate that attributional style was not predictive of the number of subsequent daily hassles. Thus, the data were supportive of a differential reactivity to stress model, but not supportive of a differential exposure to stress model. Implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in the hopelessness theory are discussed.

It is not known whether this biased attributional style also characterizes individuals at clinical risk for psychosis or if it is associated with their emergent paranoia. Methods: thirty-three clinical high-risk patients and 15 age- and gender-similar controls were assessed with the internal, personal, and situational attributions questionnaire for externalizing and personalizing attributional biases and for potential correlates with suspiciousness and other symptoms. Results: both patients and controls had a similar external-personalizing attributional style that was unrelated to symptoms, including suspiciousness. Conclusions: consistent with other studies, a biased attributional style was not associated with subthreshold paranoia. Therefore, a biased attributional style is likely not a trait that contributes to emergent paranoid delusions but is instead a state-dependent correlate of paranoid delusions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,ATTRIBUTION;HIGH RISK;PSYCHOSIS;SCHIZOPHRENIA;SOCIAL COGNITION;Psychotic Disorders;Adolescent,,
rayyan-470329546,The Emergence Of Gender Differences In Depression During Adolescence,1994,1,1,PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN,,,,,NOLENHOEKSEMA S and GIRGUS JS,,,,,"There are no gender differences in depression rates in prepubescent children, but, after the age of 15, girls and women are about twice as likely to be depressed as boys and men. In this article, three models for how gender differences in depression might develop in early adolescence are described and evaluated. According to model 1, the causes of depression are the same for girls and boys, but these causes become more prevalent in girls than in boys in early adolescence. According to model 2, there are different causes of depression in girls and boys, and the causes of girls' depression become more prevalent than the causes of boys' depression in early adolescence. According to model 3, girls are more likely than boys to carry risk factors for depression even before early adolescence, but these risk factors lead to depression only in the face of challenges that increase in prevalence in early adolescence. Most studies of gender differences in depression have focused on the effects of individual variables on depression in girls and boys rather than on testing models of how these differences develop. Evidence for the variables most commonly thought to contribute to gender differences in depression in children and adolescents is reviewed, and this evidence is related to the three models for how these differences develop. It is concluded that model 3 is best supported by the available data, although much more research is needed. Before adolescence, girls appear to develop more risk factors for depression than boys; girls also apparently face more new challenges in early adolescence than boys. It is argued that these factors combine, as specified in model 3, to generate gender differences in depression beginning in early adolescence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Adolescent,,

In behavioral medicine, the limited data are available on obese peoples physical activity and its related psychological predictors based on psychological theories. Purpose: to identify the differences in physical activity and its related motivational attributes among normal weight, overweight, and obese adolescents and to find the effect of body mass index (bmi) and the self-determination theory (sdt) constructs in predicting physical activity. Method: one thousand seventy-one students ranging from seventh to ninth grades were randomly selected from three junior high schools in seoul (359 normal weight students, 468 overweight students, and 244 obese students). A korean version of behavioral regulation in exercise questionnaire-2 and leisure time exercise questionnaire were applied to measure the participants motivational attributes and physical activity. Results: overweight and obese adolescents showed higher scores on amotivation and externally motivated regulations for physical activity than their normal weight counterparts. Internal regulation was more significant for physical activity in normal weight adolescent. However, there was no difference in physical activity among the three groups. Additionally, the findings identified that bmi and the sdt constructs were significant to explain physical activity. Conclusion: this study offers fundamental knowledge in gaining a clearer understanding of the types of motivation most likely to contribute to the initiation and promotion of physical activity in overweight and obese adolescents.

Patient beliefs may affect detection and subsequent engagement with management. Q-methodology can help to identify viewpoints that are likely to influence either clinical practice or policy intervention.; Aim: to identify socially shared viewpoints of comorbid depression, and characterise key overlaps and discrepancies.; Design and setting: a q-methodology study of patients registered with general practices or community clinics in leeds, uk.; Method: patients with coronary heart disease or diabetes and depression from three practices and community clinics were invited to participate. Participants ranked 57 statements about comorbid depression. Factor analyses were undertaken to identify independent accounts, and additional interview data were used to support interpretation.; Results: thirty-one patients participated; 13 (42%) had current symptoms of depression. Five accounts towards comorbid depression were identified: overwhelmed resources; something medical or within me; a shameful weakness; part of who i am; and recovery-orientated. The main differences in attitudes related to the cause of depression and its relationship with the patient's chronic illness, experience of shame, and whether medical interventions would help recovery.; Conclusion: there are groups of patients who do not perceive a relationship between their depression and chronic illness; they may not understand the intention behind policy initiatives to identify depression during chronic illness reviews. Tailoring detection strategies for depression to take account of different clusters of attitudes and beliefs could help improve identification and personalise management.

Globally, disparities range from countries where there is little provision to those where, despite the availability of evidence-based mental health care, service access and outcomes are mediated by social factors such as socio-economic status, race/ethnicity, and culture. This is salient because increasingly diverse populations are inevitably created with globalization. We posit that in multicultural contexts, effective therapeutic engagement requires therapists who are competent and confident to work with diversity and difference, utilizing insights into their own as well as their clients' internal and external worlds. Although there are many reasons why psychotherapies can be insensitive and harmful, for example, the inherent power imbalance in therapeutic relationships, a lack of awareness of cultural and ethnic variation and needs are among them. Acquisition of `cultural competence' and increasing availability of culturally-adapted interventions should, in theory, enable practitioners to work with a range of individuals with whom they might have little in common. However, whilst cultural adaptation appears promising, there are concerns regarding its viability as a strategy for tackling disparities in access to psychological care. Evidence for cultural competency is patchy at best. We show how and why delivering effective psychotherapy in the twenty-first century requires a paradigm shift from current approaches to truly integrated models, developed in collaboration with recipients of care. Coproducing interventions, training, and means of evaluating them with clients necessitates taking into consideration social contexts, alternative conceptualizations of mental health and disorders and difficulties, and what constitutes appropriate helpful interventions for psychological distress. Practitioner points upskilling therapists to work with diversity and difference is essential for effective delivery of psychological treatments. Increasing the availability of culturally-adapted interventions together with therapists who are sufficiently competent and confident to deliver them should enable practitioners to work with a range of individuals with whom they might have little in common. Coproducing culturally appropriate means of responding to mental health difficulties, staff training and development, and service evaluation methods with clients necessitates taking into consideration social contexts, alternative explanatory models of mental health and `illness', and what constitutes helpful interventions for psychological distress.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,CULTURAL ADAPTATION;CULTURAL COMPETENCE;CULTURE;DISPARITIES;;ETHNICITY;GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH;PSYCHOLOGICAL CARE;Self Psychology;Psychology,,

Child abuse is at the end of a neglect continuum, which ranges from neglect due to parental ignorance to deliberate maltreatment; it is not always possible to distinguish the point at which neglect becomes abuse. Abuse can take the form of a direct physical attack, severe or unusual discipline, the deprivation of basic needs such as food, or any other action that could result in immediate physical or mental damage to the child. The types of injuries frequently encountered in physically abused children are described. It is noted that the major problem in determining the extent of child abuse lies in establishing the ratio between the number of actual cases and the number of reported cases. It is contended that current statistics underestimate the actual problem. Etiological factors involve a social derivative of biological, psychological, and cultural interaction. The etiological contributions of psychodynamic, social learning, family structure, environmental stress, and mental illness models are delineated. Strategies for management and intervention based on a multi-disciplinary approach are outlined.

Perceived controllability of anxiety symptoms appears to be shaped partially through verbal persuasion; however, little is known about the origins of these beliefs. Extant findings indicate that the perceived controllability of other mental health concerns can be caused by exposure to etiological explanations. Specifically, exposure to biological and genetic explanations causes lower perceived symptom controllability, whereas exposure to psychological and social explanations does not impact perceived mental health controllability in this way. Despite these findings, this causal relationship remains unexamined with regard to anxiety. The present study aimed to provide the first test of the potentially causal relationship between exposure to biogenetic and psychosocial etiological explanations and perceived anxiety controllability. Participants were randomized to view one of two presentations about the etiology of anxiety and completed a self-report measure of anxiety controllability. Any relationship between etiological beliefs and perceived anxiety controllability was impossible to determine due to failure of the experimental manipulation to produce statistically significant differences between groups on a manipulation check. A model of naïve theory formation, perseverance, and change is used to compare methods of the current study with those of studies that effectively manipulated lay beliefs about mental health. Factors negatively impacting motivation for processing naïve theories and biases in processing of novel information are identified as potential causes of the manipulation failure in the present study. Future studies may successfully manipulate participants' beliefs by motivating naïve theory processing, establishing an environment conducive to naïve theory processing, and presenting content likely to overcome biases in information processing.

In study 1, which looked at 6 emotions (happiness, hope-challenge, anger, guilt, fear-anxiety, and sadness), 136 undergraduates reported on their attributions, appraisals, and emotions during past encounters associated with a variety of situations. In study 2, which focused on anger and guilt, 120 undergraduates reported on these same variables in response to experimenter-supplied vignettes that systematically manipulated theoretically relevant attributions. The results of both studies indicated that the emotions were more directly related to appraisals than they were to attributions, and study 2 provided evidence that appraisal serves as a mediator between attribution and emotional response. These findings lend support to the hypothesized status of appraisal as the most proximal cognitive antecedent of emotion.

News media and public attention have focused on the implications of this trend for infants exposed to opioids prenatally, with state policy responses varying in the extent to which they are punitive or public health oriented. We fielded a six-group randomized experiment among a nationally representative sample of us adults to test the effects of narratives portraying a woman with opioid pain reliever addiction during pregnancy on beliefs about people addicted to opioid pain relievers, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, policy attitudes, and emotional responses. Portraying a high socioeconomic status (ses) woman in the narrative lowered perceptions of individual blame for addiction and reduced public support for punitive policies. Depicting the barriers to treatment faced by a low ses woman lowered support for punitive policies and increased support for expanded insurance coverage for treatment. The extent to which narratives portraying successfully treated addiction affected public attitudes depended on the ses of the woman portrayed. These findings can inform the development of communication strategies to reduce stigma toward this population, reduce support for punitive policies, and increase support for more public health oriented approaches to addressing this problem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,MESSAGE FRAMING;PUBLIC OPINION;SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS;ADDICTION;;VULNERABLE POPULATIONS;WOMEN'S HEALTH;Pregnancy,,

We have developed a new measure, the side effect attribution scale (seas), which examines the degree to which people believe their symptoms are treatment side effects. Methods: the seas was tested in three new zealand studies: a vaccination sample (n = 225), patients with gout or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 102), and patients switching to a generic medicine (n = 69). The internal reliability of the scale was examined using cronbach's alpha. To assess validity, the side effect attribution total score and side effect attribution binary score were related to a number of psychological measures associated with side effect reporting. Results: the scale showed good internal reliability across the three studies, with cronbach alphas ranging from 0.840 to 0.943. Analysis of the effect sizes showed that the attribution total score was generally more strongly associated with nocebo responding than attribution binary score. Participants had greater side effect attribution total scores if they had higher expectations for vaccination side effects (r = 0.18, p = .028), more worry about future vaccine effects (r = 0.16, p = .046), a higher perceived sensitivity to medicines (r = 0.50, p < .001), greater anxiety (r = 0.25, p = .016), greater intentional non-adherence (r = 0.30, p = .003), greater medicine information seeking (r = 0.26, p = .010), lower trust in pharmaceutical agencies (r = -0.29, p = .026), and lower medicine efficacy beliefs (r = -0.46, p < .001). Conclusions: the seas provides a more nuanced assessment of symptom attribution beliefs. It appears to be more sensitive measure than just a side effect total, as it is associated with a greater number of relevant psychological variables. Future research should examine the scale in other populations and settings.

According to this model the antidepressant effect is caused by a change in sleep architecture triggered by the ictal events induced by ect. This change in sleep architecture - a profound change in the neurophysiological and neurochemical state of the organism - is what causes the therapeutic effects of ect and not any simple change in the release of neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors and/or hormones. This realization also means that a comparable antidepressant effect could be achieved without the need of inducing seizures, but with the help of behavioral interventions that explicitly take aim at changing sleep architecture.

We investigated the influence of psychological factors on hrql and disability in copd individuals recruited from the general population. In line with leventhal's common sense model, we expected psychological factors to be associated with hrql and disability even after controlling for medical status. Methods: individuals with copd (n=502; 59.7years old; gold grades were i: 3\%, ii: 17\%, iii: 34\%, iv: 46\%) were assessed through an online survey administered via copd patient organisations in germany. Individuals filled in the short form health survey (sf-12), copd assessment test, patient health questionnaire (modules: gad-2, phq-15, phq-9), brief illness perception questionnaire, a questionnaire that assesses causal illness attributions, and the internal illness-related locus of control scale of the `kkg questionnaire for the assessment of control beliefs about illness and health'. Multiple linear regressions were calculated. Results: the investigated factors explained high variances (disability=56\%, physical hrql=28\%, mental hrql=63\%, p <=.001). Better mental health, more optimistic illness perceptions, attribution to psychological causes, and stronger internal locus of control were associated with lower disability and better hrql. Comorbid somatic symptoms contributed to high disability and low quality of life. Conclusion: psychological factors, such as illness perception, attribution and internal locus of control, were associated with disability and hrql.

We assessed whether this uncertainty reflected heterogeneity among subgroups of hispanic persons and investigated possible mechanisms. Specifically, we examined factors associated with medication preferences in non-hispanic white and spanish-speaking and english-speaking hispanic persons. Methods: we analyzed data from a follow-up telephone interview of 839 non-hispanic white and 139 hispanic respondents originally surveyed via the 2008 california behavioral risk factor surveillance system. Measures included treatment preferences (for treatment plans including vs not including antidepressants); depression history and current symptoms; sociodemographics; and psychological measures. Results: compared with non-hispanic white respondents (adjusting for age, sex, history of depression diagnosis, and current depression symptoms), spanish-speaking hispanic (adjusted odds ratio [aor] 0.41; 95\% ci, 0.19-0.90) but not english-speaking hispanic (aor, 1.18; 95\% ci, 0.60-2.33) respondents had a lower preference for antidepressant inclusive options. Endorsing a biomedical explanation of depression was associated with a preference for antidepressant inclusive options (aor, 4.76; 95\% ci, 3.13-7.14) for all respondents and accounted for the effect of spanish-language interview. Accounting for other factors did not change these relationships, although older age and history of depression diagnosis remained significant predictors of antidepressant inclusive treatment preference for all respondents. Conclusions: spanish-language interview and less belief in a biomedical explanation for depression were associated with hispanic respondents' lower preferences for pharmacologic treatment of depression; ethnicity was not. Understanding treatment preferences and illness beliefs could help optimize depression treatment in primary care.

Interview texts were transcribed, translated and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Most informants identified the case as a depression pattern, a term that lacked clear definition and standardised criteria. The mechanism of disease for mdd symptoms were regarded to be liver-qi dysregulation and an imbalance of yin and yang. The tcm practitioners implemented individualised diagnosis, treatment, and a holistic concept without clear distinction between the mind and the body. This contrasted with the biomedical tradition of separating psychologisation and somatisation.

Objective: the investigation and documentation of different socio-demographic and personality-specific factors in regards to preventative measures and consequent specific health behaviors during the covid-19 pandemic, based on the health belief model. Method: an online survey was conducted on n = 3,006 individuals living in germany and austria during the early stages of lockdown. The questionnaire consisted of a self-administered section, exploring the dimensions posited in the health belief model: perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, perceived benefits of health-promoting measures, and engagement in health-promoting behaviors. Additionally, the following standardized scales were used to record personality determinants: the stress coping style questionnaire svf 78 to evaluate coping and processing strategies in stressful circumstances, the positive and negative affect schedule (panas) to assess the emotional state induced by the coronavirus crisis, the ui-18 scale to diagnose the intolerance of uncertainty, and the state-trait anxiety inventory (stai) to assess anxiety. Results: in line with the health belief model, four groups were created based on perceived susceptibility and engagement in health-promoting behaviors, and consequently studied in relation to personality determinants. Those four groups differed significantly in regards to almost all personality dimensions (p <= 0.005). Group 1 (n = 450) shows a reduced engagement with protective measures and displays underestimation of the covid-19-pandemic. Group 2 (n = 984) displays many positive personality variables and high compliance with protective measures. Group 3 (n = 468) perceives the subjective risk of disease as high, but high emotional discomfort and stress caused by the protective measures leads to the activation of a complex fear defense. Group 4 (n = 1,004) is highly anxious and therefore compliant. Conclusion: this typification has implications for establishing the appropriate support systems. This is particularly important to encourage compliance with preventive regulations within the groups, which showed poor abidance for several reasons. For group 1, further education on the realistic threat and efficient protective measures is as central as the fostering of empathy for others; with its resource-conscious exemplary behavior group 2 could be used as a positive social role model. Group 3 would benefit from promoting self-care, while group 4 requires information on psychosocial assistance availability in order to mitigate the high stress to which the group members are subjected.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,COVID-19;LOCKDOWN;PREVENTIVE MEASURE;HEALTH BELIEF MODEL;;ONLINE-SURVEY,,
rayyan-470329570,Descriptive Psychology And The Person Concept: Essential Attributes Of Persons And Behavior,2019,1,1,NA,,,,,SCHWARTZ W,,,,,"Inauspiciously, i started graduate school skeptical about my field of studyclinical and experimental psychology. As an undergraduate, i was impressed by the reasonably designed experiments described in my psychology classes, but the personality theories taught read like warring theologies. And what made it worse, the more scientific they sounded, the less i recognized anyone i knew. Where was the person in the theory? Not alone, i remember one of my professors saying, 'with so much horseshit around, there must be a pony in there somewhere.' Other than refinements in experimentation and the acknowledgment of failures to replicate classic studies, not much has changedexcept, too often, rebranding practices with the prefix 'neuro.' Clinicians, when they bother with theory at all, still align as partisans of faith. Even today, when my students interview for training sites theyre asked if their orientation is psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, or humanistic. To quell their anxiety, i suggest they answer theyve a psychodynamic and social-learning appreciation of relationships, and a set of cognitive-behavioral tools they empathically apply. Some hear this and relax, intuitively feeling it expresses what they actually try to do. Id like to offer their intuition explicit coherence. What gives a subject matter coherence and integrity? Once a subject matter is identifiedin our case, the behavior of personswhat must it account for, and what manners of observing, formulating, theorizing, explaining, etc., are compatible with the subject or violate its integrity? And, crucially, are there concepts so fundamental to the subject that they must be maintained? Heres a first reminder: as a psychologist and a behavioral scientist, all of my professional work is the work only a person can do. This, of course, holds for all of us. As a psychologist who practices psychotherapy my interests center on the behavior and characteristics of people, especially how we come to be the way we are and how we can change. This requires having the concept of a person in the first place. Fortunately, we already do, but its mostly implicit. This book is about making it systematic and explicit. Being systematic and explicit provides clarity and facilitates negotiation about where we agree, disagree, or dont have a clue. My introduction to the person concept came early fall 1972 when i read somewhere nasa had asked, 'if green gas on the moon speaks to an astronaut, how do we know if its a person?' God knows why it came up but north of nederland, high in the rockies, warm around a campfire, a classmate said one of our professors had an answer.

This is known as the 'correspondence bias.' This tendency can lead normal, intelligent persons to make suboptimal decisions. Here, we used a neuropsychological approach to investigate the neural basis of the correspondence bias, by studying economic decision-making in patients with damage to the ventromedial pfc (vmpfc). Given the role of the vmpfc in social cognition, we predicted that vmpfc is necessary for the normal correspondence bias. In our experiment, consistent with expectations, healthy (n = 46) and brain-damaged (n = 30) comparison participants displayed the correspondence bias during economic decision-making and invested no differently when given dispositional or situational information. By contrast, vmpfc patients (n = 17) displayed a lack of correspondence bias and invested more when given dispositional than situational information. The results support the conclusion that vmpfc is critical for normal social inference and the correspondence bias. The findings help clarify the important (and sometimes disadvantageous) role of social inference in economic decision-making.

Method: in all, 320 adults completed a two-part questionnaire. In the first part, they were given two vignettes describing a 30-year-old female and a 45-year-old male both with depression. They were asked what they thought (if anything) was wrong with the person and how they could best be helped. In the second part, they completed two questionnaires, one which lists 47 possible causes and the other 48 possible treatments for depression. Results: most participants diagnosed' depression for the two vignettes although they chose very different terms and offered a variety of cures', including medication and counselling. The questionnaires about cause and cure factored into seven interpretable factors which were logically correlated. A series of regressions showed that sex, age, media interest, political beliefs, experience with depression and other mental illnesses as well as having known of others diagnosed with depression predicted different beliefs about the causes and cures of depression. Conclusion: people have a detailed and multidimensional view of the causes and cures for depression which is systematically related to each other.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,DEPRESSION;MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY;AGE,,

In study 1, the japanese edition of hopelessness scale for children developed by kazdin, french, unis, esveldt-dawsan, and sherick (1983) was constructed. Seventeen original items were translated into japanese and they were administrated to 405 fifth- and sixth-graders. All of the items could be included to the japanese edition of hopelessness scale. The reliability and validity was examined. In study 2, the relation between hopelessness and causal attribution in children were investigated. The causal attribution questionnaire developed by higuchi, kambare, and otsuka (1983) and the hopelessness scale developed by study 1 were administered to 188 sixth-graders. Children with high scores in hopelessness scale significantly attributed negative events to much more effort factor than children with low scores. It supports neither the reformulated learned helplessness model nor the causal attribution theory of achievement motivation. It was explained mainly from points of self-serving attribution, cultural difference, and social desirability.

One possible risk factor is attributional style or the types of causes individuals habitually offer for negative life events. This study examined the association between pessimistic attributional style and symptoms of ptsd. Because of methodological problems with the traditional questionnaire measurement of dispositional attributional style, this investigation added a structured content analysis of participants' trauma narratives to examine associations between trauma-specific attributions and ptsd symptoms. Dispositional attributional style, measured by the attributional style questionnaire (asq), was significantly associated with ptsd symptoms, but traumaspecific attributions more strongly predicted symptoms.

South asian participants made significantly higher attributions of responsibility and reported more anger in response to the vignette compared to caucasian participants, regardless of vignette ethnicity. Both south asian and caucasian participants attributed more responsibility and control to the vignette of the same ethnicity compared to the vignette of a different ethnicity, although this effect was slightly stronger for the south asian participants. Exploratory analyses conducted to examine interactions between participant ethnicity and vignette gender yielded no significant effects.

This collection of excellent papers on longitudinal mri studies provides a balanced overview on what is going on in the field of psychiatric neuroimaging. Imaging in general has contributed largely in attempting to unravel the pathophysiology of psychosis, and in particular longitudinal imaging lead to better models of investigating neurodevelopment. More recently, the imaging field clearly moved the bar up and the ambition is for brain scans to be helpful in clinical practice, e.g., can we predict who is going to be ill? Can one predict future outcome? With the development of new explanatory models, such as neuroinflammation, innovative ways of data processing and analysis, and advances in imaging techniques, one can expect imaging findings will contribute to our understanding of the biological basis of psychosis and may become a valuable tool in the clinics.

It was predicted that cognized arousal (due either to perception of actual arousal or to arbitrary feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a non-emotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to higher subjective report of anxiety and to greater avoidance than with either of these conditions unmet. Results on the subjective report measure generally support this hypothesis. Arbitrary feedback about arousal level did not interact with the actual arousal manipulation, nor did it produce changes in pulse rate or blood pressure, further supporting a cognitive interpretation of the effects of autonomic arousal on subjective report.

The attributional theories reviewed include learned helplessness theory, the reformulation of learned helplessness, and the hopelessness theory of depression. The interpersonal theory of depression of james coyne (1976a) was used as the interactional context to examine how attributional theories could be integrated for a new theoretical framework in understanding depression.

A Systematic Literature Review",2020,1,1,CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY \& PSYCHOTHERAPY,,,,,GODWIN TL and GODWIN HJ and SIMONDS LM,,,,,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) is one of the most debilitating health conditions in the world. There has been a vast amount of research into factors that increase the likelihood of developing ocd, and there are several explanatory models. Current cognitive models of ocd can be split into appraisal-based and self-doubt models. To date, cognitive-behavioural therapy for ocd (grounded in appraisal-based models) is the recommended treatment approach, and research into the importance of self-doubt beliefs has been somewhat neglected. This paper therefore aims to consolidate current research, utilizing a systematic review approach, to establish the relationship between fear of self, self-ambivalence, and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. A systematic search was conducted based on inclusion criteria identified for this review. Papers were then individually appraised for quality and key data extracted from each paper. A total of 11 studies were included in the final sample. Fear of self and self-ambivalence were both consistently found to be significant predictors of obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. In particular, research suggests that there is a strong link between self-doubt beliefs and obsessions and obsessional beliefs related to ocd.

A model of recovery was proposed demonstrating the interactive relationship of these three variables over time. This model hypothesized that initial alcohol use would influence future decisions to drink through the mediating effects of attributions and motivation. Cognitive coping skills would be more influential than behavioral skills in avoiding future relapse and improving drinking status over time. The effect of early cognitive coping on future drinking was proposed to be indirect, mediated by attributions and motivation. The effect of attributions and motivation on future drinking would also be indirect, mediated by the later use of both behavioral and cognitive coping skills. This model was tested using data from project match, an niaaa-funded, multi-site treatment matching study (n = 1728). The full model could not be tested because of inadequacies in the instrument used in the study; modest support was found for components of the proposed model. Two thirds of participants drank during treatment but of these, 40% were abstinent or drinking less after one year. Early drinking was mediated by internal attributions and external motivation, but abstinence was not mediated by internal motivation. Internal motivation was found to mediate the effect of initial cognitive coping on ongoing abstinence and the effect of internal motivation was mediated by both cognitive and behavioral coping. Both internal attributions and external motivation had a moderating effect on the effect of both early cognitive and early behavioral coping on continued drinking. Cognitive coping was not found to be more influential on long-term recovery than behavioral skills. Those whose drinking improved used eleven different behavioral and cognitive skills significantly more than those whose drinking increased or remained the same. Attending aa was the only coping strategy that consistently differentiated improved from unimproved drinkers at each of the three follow-up periods.

Most women (63%) reported high levels of growth. Multivariate analyses revealed that positive reappraisal coping, and emotional support were associated with higher levels of growth, and depressive affect was negatively associated with growth. In addition, african american women reported more stress-related growth than that reported by white women. Stressor characteristics (i.e., disease stage, number of physical symptoms, and time since hiv diagnosis), self-esteem, perceived control, practical support, and positive affect were not associated with growth. These findings suggest that stress-related growth is more than positive reappraisal and the absence of negative affect, and that social resources may facilitate greater growth.

Depression is rarely diagnosed in primary care settings in vietnam, and those afflicted usually only seek professional care when the illness has become very severe. Depressive disorders affecting mothers are an important cause of low birth-weight, childhood stunting, under nutrition and adverse mental development, and a study has shown a 33\% prevalence of postnatal depression symptoms in ho chi minh city. Methods: the aim of this study was to elicit illness explanatory models (ems) of depression and postnatal depression from nine mothers and nine health workers. The study was conducted in a semi-rural area in vietnam, and the ems were elicited through semi-structured interviews where a case vignette of depression was used as the basis of questioning. Results: the ems elicited were predominantly somatosocial in nature and the mothers assigned a strong personal responsibility for care. Psychiatric treatment and care was seldom recommended. Lack of communication was described as an important factor concealing depression, and together with the lack of care-seeking can be expected to impede effective treatment. Limitations: the results of this study cannot be generalised beyond the group studied, or the context of ba vi, though we believe that analytical generalisation to other contexts can be made. Conclusion (clinical relevance): the results of this study highlight the importance of depression and postnatal depression being diagnosed in primary care, and of a cross-sectoral approach for the prevention of depression in vietnam, which takes into account the social causation of depression in women.

Data came from the collaborative psychiatric epidemiology surveys (cpes), 2001-2003. The study included 7587 non-latino white, 4746 african american, 1442 mexican, 1106 other hispanic, 656 other asian, 600 chinese, 577 cuban, 520 vietnamese, 508 filipino, and 495 puerto rican individuals. The composite international diagnostic interview (cidi) was used to measure psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (mdd), general anxiety disorder (gad), social phobia, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), alcohol abuse, and binge eating disorders. A single-item measure was used to estimate physical srh. Demographic (age and gender) and socioeconomic (education and income) factors were also measured. Unadjusted and adjusted correlations between psychiatric disorders and physical srh were calculated. Major ethnic variations were found in the correlation between psychiatric disorders and physical srh; as well as the role of demographic and socioeconomic status (ses) factors in explaining these associations. Non-hispanic whites, cubans, and african americans showed more correlations between psychiatric disorders and physical srh than other ethnic groups. In non-hispanic whites, the associations between psychiatric disorders and physical srh were explained by demographic factors. In african americans, the link between psychiatric disorders and poor physical srh were explained by ses indicators. In conclusion, although single-item physical srh measures are traditionally assumed to reflect the physical health needs of populations, they may also indicate psychiatric disorders in some ethnic groups, such as non-hispanic whites, cubans, and african americans. Demographic and socioeconomic factors also have differential roles in explaining the link between psychiatric disorders and physical srh. Physical srh does not exclusively reflect physical health, and it may be more biased by mental health across some ethnic groups.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,ETHNIC GROUPS;PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS;SELF-RATED HEALTH;Ethnic Groups,,

Thus, this qualitative study examined (a) how widows in nepal understand grief, (b) whether a local construct of pcbd exists, and (c) its comparability with the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (dsm-5), terminology. Methods: using an adapted explanatory model interview catalogue (emic) framework, semistructured interviews with 25 widows and 12 key informants, as well as three focus-group discussions (n = 20), were conducted between october 2014 and april 2015. Through an inductive grounded theory-based approach, we used the constant comparative method, iteratively coding transcripts to identify themes and patterns in the data. Also, we created two lists of grief responses, one of early reactions and another all reactions to grief, based on the frequency of mention. Results: no single term for grief was reported. Widows reported a local construct of pcbd, which was broadly compatible with dsm-5 terminology but with important variation reflecting societal influence. Surviving torture during conflict, economic and family stressors, and discrimination were mentioned as important determinants that prolong and complicate grief. Suicidal ideation was common, with about 31\% and 62\% of widows reporting past-year and lifetime suicidality, respectively. Findings may not be generalizable to all nepali widows; participants were recruited from a non-governmental organization, from kathmandu and its neighboring districts, and were primarily of reproductive age.

The sociocultural brain provides a new perspective on human brain functional organization, highlighting the role of human sociocultural experience and its interaction with genes in shaping the human brain and behavior. Drawing on cutting edge research from the burgeoning field of cultural neuroscience, it reveals the cross-cultural differences in human brain activity that underlie a multitude of cognitive and affective processes, including visual perception/attention, memory, causal attribution, inference of others' mental states, self-reflection, and empathy. In addition, it presents studies that integrate brain imaging and cultural priming to explore the causal relationship between culture and brain functional organization.

Participants listed approach and avoidance goals separately and generated explanations for why they would (pro) and would not (con) achieve their most important approach and avoidance goals, before rating the importance, likelihood, and perceived control of goal outcomes. Counter to hypothesis, depressed persons did not differ from never-depressed controls on number of approach or avoidance goals, or on the perceived importance of these goals. However, compared to never-depressed controls, depressed individuals gave lower likelihood judgments for desirable approach goal outcomes, tended to give higher likelihood judgments for undesirable to-be-avoided goal outcomes, and gave lower ratings of their control over goal outcomes. Furthermore, although controls generated significantly more pro than con reasons for goal achievement, depressed participants did not.

Design: 263 participants took part in an experimental study using vignettes describing the symptoms of four conditions: depression, schizophrenia, psoriasis and type 1 diabetes. The within group factor was condition type (physical and mental health). The between groups factor was duration of symptoms (two weeks/ 'acute' or one year/ 'chronic'). Measures: participants completed the illness perception questionnaire - revised for healthy individuals (figueiras & alves, 2007) and questions regarding their attitudes about the importance of personal attributes, such as optimism and resilience, in recovery ('personal recovery'). Results: the inter-relationship of illness representations followed some of the general patterns found in previous research. Participants attributed mental health vignettes to more psychosocial causes and placed more importance on personal recovery than they did for physical health vignettes, although there were some interaction effects of chronicity. Personal recovery attitudes positively correlated with psychosocial causes in all conditions and perceived personal control in all conditions except diabetes. Conclusion: preliminary evidence was found that lay attitudes about personal attributes being important for recovery was more endorsed in mental health than physical health conditions and was related to perceptions of personal control and psychosocial causes of illness.

Different models of interpretation as to be found in scientific literature are reviewed. On the basis of today's physiological knowledge, five hypotheses on causal explanation of pain insensitivity in schizophrenics are discussed: hypalgesia and analgesia are an expression of motorial inability to react; a consequence of a disorder of consciousness; an analgetic effect of neuroleptic drugs; a basic deficit in schizophrenia and; a result of a disturbed psycho-physiological development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,SCHIZOPHRENIC PSYCHOLOGY*;HYPESTHESIA/*PSYCHOLOGY;NOCICEPTORS/*PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;PAIN MEASUREMENT/*METHODS;SCHIZOPHRENIA/*PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;HUMANS;SCHIZOPHRENIA;CATATONIC/PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;CATATONIC/PSYCHOLOGY;SENSORY THRESHOLDS/PHYSIOLOGY;Schizophrenia;Somatoform Disorders,,

In this paper, we examined one such mechanism: control attributions. To do so, we ran an experiment (n = 140) in which we manipulated mortality salience and type of failure (relevant vs. Irrelevant consequences) with which participants were faced. Participants were then instructed to evaluate the possible causes of their failure. The results indicated that participants assigned to the mortality salience condition, compared to those assigned to the control group, were more prone to making controllable attributions. That is, even in situations in which individuals are motivated to avoid responsibility (i.e., a relevant failure), mortality salience increased perceived controllability. These results suggest that attributions might serve as a control mechanism to compensate for the sheer uncontrollability of death.

The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between acculturation, mental health ideology, willingness to seek mental health services, and actual utilization of such resources among mexican american men. Method. A convenience sample was composed of 179 men of mexican american descent attending three community colleges and a private university in southern california, with a mean age of 26 years. The opinion about mental illness scale (omi) was used to measure five mental health ideologies: authoritarianism, benevolence, mental hygiene ideology, social restrictiveness, and interpersonal etiology. The acculturation rating scale for mexican american-ii (arsma-ii) was used to measure acculturation. The attitude toward seeking professional psychological (atspp) was used to measure willingness to seek help. Surveys were completed in classroom settings. The cronbach alpha measures of internal consistency within the present study were low for atspp and the ideology subscales of benevolence, mental health ideology and social restrictiveness. Results with these measures should be interpreted cautiously. Result. Anova, pearson correlation, t-test, and content analysis were used to analyze the data. A pearson correlation showed that those men who scored higher on mental hygiene ideology were less willing to seek mental health services (r = -.34). Different levels of acculturation were unrelated to seeking help, and any of the mental hygiene ideology scales. Those who have sought help compared to those who have not were more willing to seek mental health services. Content analysis of two open-ended questions indicated that those who receive psychological help tend to embrace a positive view toward those who need mental health, which is likely to be attributed to their past and present help seeking behavior. It is likely that their past experiences receiving mental heath services influence their perceptions about mental health services. Future research should further examine a more diverse sample of mexican american men to add to the understanding of their mental health belief system and help seeking behavior.

Methods a community sample of african americans, latinos, and white diabetic adults receiving services in 1 of 2 central austin, texas facilities participated in the study. Each participant was given a survey, which consisted of the following 5 components: (1) illness screener questions, (2) demographic questions, (3) patient health questionnaire, (4) depression treatment questionnaire, and (5) illness perception questionnaire. A binary logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between cultural perceptions of symptoms and the predictor variables. A multinomial logistic regression analyses was used to examine the relationship between treatment and provider preferences for the symptoms of depression and ethnicity. Results the first research question addressed whether there were differences across ethnicity in how symptoms of depression are attributed among patients with diabetes. There were 7 causal beliefs that were associated with differences in cultural endorsements of the causes of depressive symptoms. In addition, culture was associated with treatment preferences but not with provider preferences. Conclusions the utility of assessing a patient's understanding of symptoms of depression to determine how personal illness models impact treatment preferences and clinical implications of how knowledge of patient's causal attributions can aid medical and behavioral health providers working in collaborative management of diabetes and depression are discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA,,

However, not every child who experiences physical abuse exhibits significant maladjustment. A prominent model has been proposed in the sexual abuse literature attributing variability in adjustment to cognitive (attributions) and emotional (shame) processing (feiring, taska, & lewis, 1996). The present study was a pilot examination of the relationship between variables in this model within a cpa population. Data from 64 children between the ages of 7 and 17 presenting for treatment subsequent to confirmed or suspected cpa was extracted from a research repository for analyses in the present investigation. As has been demonstrated in previous literature, more self-blame was associated with higher rates of depression and ptss among this sample. A significant relationship between severity of abuse and adjustment was not detected. Furthermore, self-blaming attributions remained significantly related to negative adjustment, even when controlling for severity of abuse. The present study also supported a relationship between the experience of shame and negative adjustment in children who have experienced physical abuse; however, shame did not mediate the relationship between attributions and adjustment in this cpa sample. Given the smaller than projected sample size and limited power, data collection is ongoing, and analyses of the present investigation will be re-run in the future when a more complete data-set has been obtained.

However, little is known about how people assess simplicity in causal explanations or what the consequences of such a preference are. We contrast 2 candidate metrics for simplicity in causal explanations: node simplicity (the number of causes invoked in an explanation) and root simplicity (the number of unexplained causes invoked in an explanation). Across 4 experiments, we find that explanatory preferences track root simplicity, not node simplicity; that a preference for root simplicity is tempered (but not eliminated) by probabilistic evidence favoring a more complex explanation; that committing to a less likely but simpler explanation distorts memory for past observations; and that a preference for root simplicity is greater when the root cause is strongly linked to its effects. We suggest that a preference for root-simpler explanations follows from the role of explanations in highlighting and efficiently representing and communicating information that supports future predictions and interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,EXPLANATION;SIMPLICITY;PARSIMONY;CAUSAL INFERENCE;INFERENCE TO THE;BEST EXPLANATION;Causality,,

Method forty-one individual interviews and six focus group interviews (n=28) were held with female turkish, moroccan and surinamese creole family carers who are looking after a close relative with dementia, and who live in the netherlands. Qualitative analysis has been carried out, supported by the software maxqda. Results the dominant explanations of dementia given by the female family carers interviewed are in line with what downs etal. Describe as the explanatory models dementia as a normal ageing process' and dementia as a spiritual experience'. In addition, some female family carers gave explanations that were about an interplay between various factors. Turkish and moroccan informal caregivers ascribe the causes of dementia relatively often to life events or personality traits, whereas surinamese creole caregivers frequently mention physical aspects, such as past dehydration. However, the explanatory model dementia as a neuropsychiatric condition', which is dominant in western cultures, was rarely expressed by the informal caregivers. The female family carers generally talked openly about the dementia with their close family, whereas particularly in the turkish and moroccan communities open communication within the broader communities was often hampered, e.g. By feelings of shame.

Partner violent (pv) and nonpartner violent (npv) groups were compared on hypothesized risk factors.; Results: in the year before treatment, about two thirds of the women were victimized by their male partners, and a similar proportion engaged in violence toward their male partners. Severe violence also was high, with 22% victimization and 50% perpetration prevalence. Women committed more violent acts overall and were more likely to commit severely violent acts than the men in these couples. Risk factors for pv in both the victimization and perpetration models were as predicted: less education, lower income, greater relationship problems, stronger beliefs in the link between relationship problems and the female patient's drinking, greater cocaine use by the perpetrator of violence and greater emotional distress of the men. Greater alcohol and drug use and more severe alcohol problems also distinguished male perpetrators from their nonviolent counterparts in the female victimization model. Predictions that female patients in the pv group would report greater substance use and problems, childhood violence exposure and emotional distress than their female counterparts in the npv group were not supported for either victimization or perpetration models.; Conclusions: partner violence is a serious problem for women in alcoholism treatment.

Results: most participants believed that bn would be difficult to treat and that relapse would be likely, were initial treatment successful. Primary care practitioners, psychologists, counsellors and close friends were perceived as helpful in the treatment of bn by the vast majority of participants. Lifestyle changes, including taking vitamins and minerals, were also highly regarded, whereas participants were ambivalent about the benefits of psychiatrists and antipathetic towards the use of prescription medication. Most participants believed that bn is common among women in the community and many had occasionally or often thought that it ``might not be too bad'' to have such a problem. Low self-esteem was considered the most likely cause of bn. Conclusions: beliefs and attitudes likely to be conducive to low or inappropriate treatment seeking exist among women with bn-type eating disorders in the community.

The paper draws on author's earlier work focusing on the (i) scientific construal of the clinical claims psychoanalysis makes and (ii) its philosophical-hermeneutic construal that extends to metapsychology. The former involves mainly a therapy premised on the empirically testable causal hypotheses, while the latter involves claims to meaning connections. As a ``theory of human nature and therapy,'' the claims of psychoanalytic inquiry are subjected to a thought-experimental-test-design patterned after what i call the paradox of the lost original text. The linguistic analog of the lost original text having any number of surviving translations in any number of languages is relevant in the context of psychoanalytic interpretation of dreams, especially to ``recovering'' the latent contents of a dream from its manifest contents. The thought-experimental-test-design sets limit to the possibilities of exploring the unconscious mind without rendering freud's methodology irrelevant or useless. The paper then briefly rethinks the frontier(s) of psychoanalytic inquiry, viewed as a branch of clinical psychology, for its relevance to the contemporary issues of individual psychical well-being. Premised on the methodological imperative of opening these frontiers to a deeper investigation than has been possible over the past hundred years, the challenging task of probing the frontiers of research opened by psychoanalytic inquiry in the world of individual psychical life, well-being and suffering is shown to extend to far deeper worlds in the ecology of consciousness, demanding carefully crafted methodological variance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,UNKNOWN KNOWABLES IN SCIENCE;MOTIVATIONAL EXPLANATIONS;EXPLANATIONS OF;ACTION BY EXPLANATORY REASONS (ER EXPLANATIONS);EXPLANATIONS OF ACTION;BY RELEVANT CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS (RC EXPLANATIONS);METHODOLOGICAL;VARIANCE,,
rayyan-470329620,Cognitive Specificity Of Depression And Anxiety: Methodological Issues And Research Findings,2000,1,1,PSYCHOLOGY: THE JOURNAL OF THE HELLENIC PSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,,,,,KLEFTARAS G,,,,,"An increasing number of studies question the distinctiveness of depression and anxiety and show, firstly, that depression and anxiety are highly correlated and, secondly, that many of the cognitive mechanisms that characterize them are very similar. Thus, although there are numerous studies concerning depression and anxiety separately, there is relative confusion regarding the cognitive variables which differentiate each of them. It is becoming increasingly clear that the study of cognitive specificity of depression and anxiety requires a comparative methodological approach that differentiates these states in the same study. In this paper the conclusions of a relatively limited number of studies adopting such an approach are presented. These studies generally focus on 'thought content', 'locus of control', 'causal attributions' and 'information processing'. Then, implications of these findings as well as certain methodological issues and weak points are discussed and, finally, ways are proposed in order to deal with them. More specifically, the discussion focuses mostly on the general distress (psychopathology) factor, the methods of assessment, the chronobiology of depression and anxiety, the control groups and the comparisons of multiple groups and their combinations.

The articles in the issue examine the topic from a variety of approaches, but each of them addresses the central problem of how normal-range individual differences are related to abnormal behavior. Seven of these articles examine personality in relation to specific types of psychopathology: personality disorders, alcoholism and antisocial personality, mood and anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. It is impossible to summarize the wealth of findings that are contained in these articles; each deserves to be examined carefully. However, we can note some general conclusions here. First, it is abundantly clear that personality traits and psychopathological disorders are, in fact, empirically related. Second, although the observed relations tend to be orderly and psychologically meaningful, they also are relatively nonspecific. That is, one does not see a one-to-one correspondence between a given trait and a specific disorder; rather, each of the extensively studied traits is associated with several diagnostic categories. Third, due to a paucity of relevant data, the nature of these observed relations is still largely unclear. Several different explanatory models have been proposed, and each has received at least suggestive support in the literature.

It was our assumption that this should also be reflected in the beliefs about mental disorders held by the general public. Methods: in autumn 1990, immediately after german reunification, a representative survey on lay concepts of schizophrenia and depression was carried out in both parts of germany. In all, 2118 personal, fully structured interviews resulted in the west, 980 in the east. Results: in general, there were more similarities than differences between west and east, particularly as concerns causal attributions (with psychosocial stress being most frequently seen as etiologically relevant) and treatment recommendations (with psychotherapy clearly favored over drug treatment). However, there were also some differences, most notably a stronger tendency in the west to define depressive behavior in psychiatric terms and to recommend established forms of psychiatric treatment for its management. Conclusions: our assumption that the exposure to different cultural influences should have led to discrepant beliefs about mental disorders was only partly confirmed. Especially with regard to schizophrenia, the prevalence of the dominant stereotype hardly differed between west and east.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Mental Disorders;Germany,,

Experiences Of Mental Illness And Perspectives From Providers, Patients, And Caregivers In Mexico",2020,1,1,NA,,,,,RAMIREZ STEGE AM,,,,,"Understanding the cross-cultural variability of conceptions of mental illness is essential to diversify scholarly knowledge on traditionally westernized conceptions of distress. Mexico is of particular scholarly interest given the historical, social, political, and academic exchanges between mexico and the u.s., with an uptake in westernized psychological practices that can be culturally incongruent with indigenous conceptions of self and mental health. This dissertation study sought to understand the mental illness experience from the perspective of mexican patients, their caregivers, and psychiatric providers using the semi-structured dsm-5 cultural formulation interview (cfi; apa, 2013). A total of 19 cases were collected, and using thematic analysis (braun & clarke, 2006) i report on the common themes related to how stakeholders described the mental illness experience, including the cause and treatment expectations. Patients and caregivers often identified interpersonal causes of distress, while providers described overall biopsychosocial components. Providers further described that increasing 'illness consciousness,' that is, a 'scientific' and biomedical understanding of distress, could increase the adoption of a sick role and improve illness management (usually through psychiatric medication) and outcomes. Another prominent theme was related to the gendered expectations of women, often seen as self-sacrificing ('mujeres abnegadas'), in the cause and maintenance of mental and emotional distress, despite multiple experiences of gender-based trauma. Finally, the prominent role of family is discussed in providing treatment support through symptom management and help navigating mental health care systems. Overall, findings are discussed in the context of the mexican mental health system and a globalized push toward 'psychological modernization' (duncan, 2017) through 'psicoeducación' (psychoeducation) into western-based conceptions at the expense of interpersonally-based explanatory models and treatment interventions.

His arguments do not appear to consider alternative hypotheses and are therefore vulnerable to the criticism of selective bias. Birtchnell argues that (1) parents, particularly mothers, cause dependence in their children; (2) female children are especially vulnerable; (3) a trait or lifelong predisposition is created for dependence; and (4) this affects the individual's relationship in adulthood or his/her liability to depressive illness. Some assumptions of birtchnell's definition are suggested and questioned, and an alternative framework is proposed. Birtchnell's assumptions are questioned particularly with regard to women, since women are likely to be seen as dependent and depressed, and birtchnell's illustrations center on female clients.

However, research into illness belief and self-efficacy of patients with alcohol-related liver disease is sparse.; Design: a cross-sectional survey.; Methods: a cohort of 159 patients with alcohol-related liver disease who attended the liver outpatient clinics at a london hospital (october 2012-november 2013) completed a set of validated instruments measuring illness beliefs, self-efficacy, emotional states and quality of life.; Findings: the mean age of enrolled patients was 52 years, 67% male, 26% live on their own, 61% had no previous history of other chronic illness and average model for end-stage liver disease and the audit alcohol consumption questions scores were 11·0 and 3·5 respectively. After adjusting for demographic and illness characteristic components, multiple regression analysis shows that the three illness belief components 'symptoms', 'understanding' and 'concerns' made a significant contribution to their confidence to self-manage their liver condition and the 'symptoms' component makes a signification contribution across to all outcome measures: anxiety, depression, quality of life and self-efficacy.; Conclusion: interventions designed to improve these patients' understanding of their illness and strategies to manage their symptoms are likely to improve their self-management, quality of life and reduce anxiety and depression.

Gender, socioeconomic status and diagnosis explained significant variance in different coping strategies while illness representations contributed between 5\% and 21\% additional explained variance. While identity, causal attributions and emotional representations explained variance in the use of avoidance and distancing, perceived personal control was important in explaining efforts to make health behavioural changes following an abnormal result. Relatively more use of escape-avoidance coping following a first abnormal screen was significantly associated with non-participation in screening 2 years later. (C) 2008 elsevier ltd.

The sample included 75 parent-child dyads, in which parents reported on their abuse risk and children independently completed measures of depressive and anxious symptomatology and a measure on their attributional style. Findings supported the model that children's attributional style for positive events (but not negative events) partially mediated the relationship between abuse risk and internalizing symptoms, with significant direct and indirect effects of abuse risk on internalizing symptomatology.

The aim of this study was to explore the association of minor affective psychopathology and the regular use of psychotropic medication with temperament and character profiles from cloninger's personality model, in a sample of active professional people. Methods: this cross-sectional study included 498 non-clinical subjects, teachers in a local school system. Instruments used included the self-administered general health questionnaire (ghq-28) to measure psychiatric morbidity; the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) to measure depressive symptoms; documentation of regular use of psychotropic medication; and the temperament and character inventory (tci-125) for personality traits self-assessment. Results: the proportion of subjects presenting psychiatric morbidity (ghq-28>6) or depressive symptoms (ces-d>20) was significantly higher among explosive, passive-aggressive, and obsessional temperament profiles. And among schizotypal, moody, melancholic and dependent character profiles. Similar results were observed with the scores on each of the four ghq-28 subscales (depression, anxiety, social dysfunction, and somatic symptoms). The regular use of psychotropic medications was significantly higher among the passive-aggressive and explosive temperament types, and among the schizoptypal and moody character types. Limitations: being a cross-sectional study, no causal attributions can be inferred. Subjects on sick leave were excluded, so the sample was not representative of the general population. The data were collected using self-reporting questionnaires, and no specific psychiatric diagnoses were obtained.

The emotional impact on parents at the birth of their new-born with cl/p could affect parent-child relationships. In light of insufficient scholarly attention parental experiences and perceptions, this study reports on caregivers' perceptions of health service provision and support for children born with cleft lip and palate in south africa. Methods: the study setting consisted of 11 academic hospital centres situated in six of south africa's nine provinces. At each of the academic centres cleft clinic, five to ten parents or caregivers were selected purposively. Participants were interviewed, using a semi-structured interview schedule that elicited socio-demographic information, explored the family experiences of having a child with cl/p, and their perceptions of care provision and support services available. The interviews were analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: seventy-nine participants were interviewed. Their mean age was 33.3 years (range 17-68 years). The majority of the parents were black african (72\%), unemployed (72\%), single (67\%) and with only primary school education (58\%). The majority of the children were male, with a mean age of 3.8 (sd = +/- 4.3) years. Five broad themes emerged from the interviews: emotional experiences following the birth of a child with cleft lip and palate; reactions from family, friends or the public; the burden of care provision; health system responsiveness; and social support services. Caregivers reported feelings of shock, anxiety, and sadness, exacerbated by the burden of care provision, health system deficiencies, lack of public awareness and insufficient social support services.

We focused on three systems of beliefs distinguished in the literature: biological, psychosocial and magical-religious. Methods: the sample comprised 253 patients (n=117 aymara, and n=136 non-aymara) of public mental health centers in chile (33.6\%), peru (33.6\%) and bolivia (32.8\%) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and each patient's primary caregiver. We administered to patients and caregivers a questionnaire with scales assessing the perceived causes of schizophrenia. Linear regression models were fitted to compare differences in the levels of causal beliefs between aymara and non-aymara patients and caregivers, and to identify socio-demographic and clinical predictors of different types of beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia. Results: adjusted for socio-demographic and clinical covariates, levels of psychosocial beliefs were significantly higher for aymara caregivers (0.33, 95\% confidence interval (ci)=0.05, 0.62) than non-aymara caregivers. Conclusions: contrary to expectations, beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia among aymara are not more magical-religious than those of their non-aymara counterparts.

The internal, personal and situational attributions questionnaire (ipsaq) was administered to 29 schizophrenia patients (10 with current paranoia), 26 psychiatric patients (ocd) and 33 healthy controls. Acutely paranoid patients made fewer internal attributions for positive and negative events, thus replicating a previously reported decreased sense of self-causation. This kind of attributional style was related to acute positive symptomatology, but not to persecutory beliefs in particular. No evidence was found for a relationship between personalizing blame and the severity of current persecutory beliefs. An analysis of the narrative causal statements of the ipsaq revealed that paranoid patients more often made external-situational attributions particularly for positive events.

Key aims were (1) to establish that psychosocial and behavioral protective factors and risk factors can account for cross-sectional and developmental variation in heavy episodic drinking, and (2) to examine whether protection moderates the impact of risk on heavy episodic drinking. Method: random- and fixed-effects maximum likelihood regression analyses were used to examine data from a three-wave longitudinal study. Data were collected in fall of 2002, spring of 2003, and spring of 2004 from college students (n=975; 548 men) who were first-semester freshmen at wave 1.

Key predictors of heavy episodic drinking were social and individual controls protection (e.g., parental sanctions for transgression and attitudinal intolerance of deviance, respectively); models risk (peer models for substance use); behavioral protection (attendance at religious services); and behavioral risk (cigarette smoking and marijuana use). Changes in controls protection, models risk, and opportunity risk were associated with change in heavy episodic drinking. Conclusions: an explanatory model based on both psychosocial and behavioral protective and risk factors was effective in accounting for variation in college-student heavy episodic drinking. A useful heuristic was demonstrated through the articulation of models, controls, support, opportunity, and vulnerability to characterize the social context, and of controls, vulnerability, and other behaviors to characterize individuals.

Maladaptive attributional style and social support correlated with multiple measures of concurrent depressive symptoms. Life stress generally failed to correlate with concurrent depressive symptoms. Prospectively, attributional style failed to predict depressive symptoms, whereas social support predicted mother but not self-, ratings of depressive symptoms. The interaction between attributional style and subsequent life stress generally failed to predict future depressive symptoms. Limited specificity was found in that risk factors correlated similarly with depressive symptoms and aggressive behaviors. Findings showed that attributional style was primarily a concomitant of depressive symptoms in the present sample, although length of follow-up and age need to be considered when testing the temporal relationships posited by causal attributional style models.

The social selection and the social causation theoretical models explaining the relationship between social support and symptomatology are evaluated. Literature supports both opposing positions and a reciprocal causation model is proposed to explain divergent findings. Social functioning (socioeconomic status [ses], education, income] employment, and financial adequacy perceptions) variables were evaluated for their impact on symptomatology. Significant financial stressors were also evaluated for impact on psychiatric symptomatology. If social support is a malleable environmental characteristic it is important for psychiatric health and program planning. Outcome variables included social support, psychiatric symptomatology, and length of inpatient stay (los). A short mail survey, assessing mental health and social support was sent to members of the mood disorders association of manitoba. Client members ( n approximately 600) were asked to complete the surveys and return them by mail (response rate of 36%). Every six months follow-up surveys were mailed until data for four time-points were collected (time-1, -2, -3, and -4 sample sizes are n = 232, n = 146, n = 123, n = 96 respectively). Path-analytic techniques incorporating cross-lagged panel regression models were used to evaluate the models. Social support and psychiatric symptomatology were inversely related, with small to moderate effect sizes (approximately r = .30) supporting both social causation and selection theoretical models. These findings provide support for some form of reciprocal causation model. Ses variables did not impact the models; but financial adequacy perceptions influenced them. The social causation model may be a better explanatory model for these participants. Almost all of the variables, including symptomatology, explain approximately 4% of variability in los.

Despite this, voice hearers still experience a great deal of stigma, which can have serious negative impacts on the person's experience of their voices, and their recovery. Research has demonstrated that healthcare professionals may be a major source of the stigma surrounding voice hearing, with service-level implications for the development and delivery of evidence-based interventions. Therefore, reducing this stigma is a critical intervention target. The purpose of this narrative review is to examine evidence for interventions aimed at reducing stigma towards people who hear voices, in populations of healthcare professionals, students, and the general public. The available evidence supports the use of anti-stigma interventions based around direct contact with voice hearers and education about voice hearing.

This article has focused narrowly on specific cellular elements of the stress-adaptational mechanisms, including the ac-pka and plc-pkc transductional cascades, together with specific response elements, such as the hpa axis, bdnf, and nmda receptors; however, other important mechanisms, including specific receptor subtypes (e.g., 5-ht1a and ne alpha 2), transmitter systems (e.g., acetylcholine and depamine), and hormones (e.g., thyroid and growth hormones and prolactin), which may be important, have not been discussed.

Method: the study included 666 jefferson medical college students who graduated in 20112013. Students used a peer nomination instrument to identify classmates who had a positive influence on their professional and personal development. At matriculation, these students had completed a survey that included the jefferson scale of empathy and zuckermankuhlman personality questionnaire short form and abridged versions of the rosenberg self-esteem scale and ucla loneliness scale. In multivariate analyses of variance, the method of contrasted groups was used to compare the personality attributes of students nominated most frequently by their peers as positive influencers (top influencers [top 25% in their class distribution], n = 176) with those of students nominated least frequently (bottom influencers [bottom 25%], n = 171). Results: the top influencers scored significantly higher on empathy, sociability, and activity and significantly lower on loneliness compared with the bottom influencers. However, the effect size estimates of the differences were moderate at best. Conclusions: the research hypotheses were partially confirmed. Positive social influencers appear to possess personality attributes conducive to relationship building, which is an important feature of effective leadership. The findings have implications for identifying and training potential leaders in medicine.

Objective: to investigate the causal attributions of patients and their gps for fatigue, their level of agreement, and the association between patients' attributions, and fatigue characteristics and other illness perceptions. Methods: baseline data, collected between 2004 and 2006, of a prospective cohort study among 642 adult patients presenting to dutch primary care practices (n = 147) with a main symptom of fatigue, were used. Patient causal attributions and illness perceptions were measured using the revised illness perception questionnaire (fatigue version). Gp causal attributions were measured with an open question included in the form that was completed at the end of the patient's visit. Fatigue severity was measured using the checklist individual strength. Results: psychosocial causes were among the most often reported causal attributions by both patients and gps. In 33\% of 519 cases, the gp had no idea about the cause whereas the patient did. Overall, the agreement between the first reported causal attribution of patients and gps was low. Qualitative differences in the labelling of causes were also found. Type of attribution (physical vs psychosocial/psychological) was associated with duration of fatigue (40 vs 25 months), and personal control (score 17.4 vs. 18.9). Conclusion: most patients and gps had ideas about the causes of fatigue, but differences were found in the first reported causes and the labelling of causes.

There were five primary goals of the study: (1) to present an indepth description of the delusional thought structure and content in schizophrenic chamorros; (2) to explore the potential connection between the chamorro cultural and historical context, and the content of chamorro delusional thought; (3) to discover the chamorro schizophrenics' explanatory models of their mental health problems; (4) to investigate whether chamorro schizophrenics reported the presence of factors associated with less industrialized cultures; and (5) to evaluate the usefulness of employing a qualitative methodology in an investigation of psychotic thought processes. Twenty chamorros diagnosed as schizophrenic from mental health facilities in saipan and guam were interviewed. An interpretive cultural analysis was conducted to relate content categories to the cultural context. Results indicated that, with the exception of two culture-specific delusional themes (witchcraft and poisoning), there were no remarkable differences in delusional thought content between north american and chamorro schizophrenics. The explanatory models described by the informants were also similar to those expected in north american mental health clients. Informants reported the strong presence of extended family; however, this influence was not always positive. The informants also described considerable stigmatization of mental health clients. In general, the findings indicate that there is an amalgamation of western and chamorro cultural content, an adoption of western explanatory models, and few factors characteristic of less industrialized cultures. This likely reflects the chamorro history of colonization and westernization, and the current cultural context of american and chamorro values and beliefs. Finally, a qualitative, cultural analysis proved to be a useful tool to understand the experience and world view of schizophrenic individuals. This methodology generated detailed data which allowed the informants the freedom to construct their own stories. Suggestions for cross-cultural, individual psychotherapeutic treatment with schizophrenic individuals are offered.

For the causal self attributions a differentiation was recommended between attributions of the child's disability and attributions of the child's concrete problem developed as a concequence of the disability. For uncertainty intolerant compared to uncertainty tolerant mothers three out of four maternal ratings (disablity- and problem-specific self attribution; problem-specific healing prognosis) correlated more strongly with ratings of the psychologists treating the disabled child. When controlled for mood level the depressive symptom's probability was higher the more the mothers attributed the disablity's cause to themself, the less they attributed the cause of the concrete problem to themself, and slightly the smaller their uncertainty tolerance was.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,DISABLED CHILDREN;CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION;UNCERTAINTY TOLERANCE;;DEPRESSION;INFORMATION PROCESSING;Disabled Children;Prognosis,,

Loss first precipitates a destabilization of values. If the destabilization persists and is severe, a loss of identity or self occurs. This loss of identity, called value diffusion, often leads to depression. Two categories of values are described: continuity values, which involve relationships, and discontinuity values, which involve achievement. A case study of a 70-yr-old depressed woman is presented to illustrate value diffusion theory and to contrast it with psychoanalytic theory and learned-helplessness theory as causal explanations of depression.

Women living with vietnam veterans suffering from ptsd report higher levels of relationship problems and lower levels of relationship satisfaction relative to women whose partners do not have ptsd. The present investigation examined the role of attributional processes in the association between male vietnam veterans' ptsd symptomatology and the relationship satisfaction of their female partners. More specifically, women's causal, responsibility, and vietnam attributions for their veteran partners' ptsd symptomatology and negative behavior were predicted to mediate the association between veterans' ptsd symptoms and women's feelings of satisfaction with the relationship. Furthermore, the type of symptom was predicted to moderate the relationship between veterans' ptsd symptoms and their partners' attributions. If positive symptoms were perceived as more salient, women were expected to be more likely to attribute the symptoms and negative behavior to the veterans' experiences in vietnam. Conversely, if negative symptoms were perceived as more salient, women were expected to be more likely to attribute cause and responsibility of the symptoms and negative behavior to the veterans. Forty-nine male vietnam theater veterans and their female partners provided information on veterans' ptsd symptomatology, women's attributions for ptsd symptoms and negative relationship behavior, and women's feelings of satisfaction with the relationship. Consistent with the literature, a significant inverse relationship was found between veterans' ptsd and women's relationship satisfaction. However, attributional processes failed to mediate the relationship. Additionally, no moderating effects were found for ptsd symptom type.

This pilot study was conducted with a sample of female veterans who had a primary care provider (pcp) and experienced a sexual functioning concern during the previous 12 months, to explore: a) whether a relationship exists between depression and sexual functioning among a sample of female veterans receiving primary care b) if female veterans' dynamic with pcps, when controlling for depression, is associated with sexual dysfunction and c) the reasons why female veterans do or do not talk to their pcp about sexual concerns. A total of 32 female veterans completed a web-based survey that assessed for depression (phq-9), sexual dysfunction (fsfi), and patient-provider alliance (kas-r). Military sexual trauma (mst) experiences were common, with 72% of the women reporting sexual harassment in the service and 41% reporting sexual assault. Moreover, women who experienced mst had higher depression scores, poorer sexual functioning, and poorer alliance with their pcps than women who did experience mst. A moderate relationship was found between depression and sexual functioning. Although 97% of the participants reported being at least a little bothered by their sexual functioning difficulties, only 12.5% had discussed their concerns with their pcp. Patient-provider alliance was not associated with poorer sexual functioning, when controlling for depression; however, depression did vary as a function of patient-provider alliance and sexual functioning. Participants reported their perceived cause of the problem, comfort level, perception of provider's ability, acceptance of the problem, and getting help for the problem as reasons for communicating or not communicating with their pcp about their sexual difficulties. Although the small sample size calls for replication before findings can be generalized, the implications for clinical care as well as the value for future research is clear.

In giving their reasons for verdicts and sentences, the majority of judges accounted for the assaults by drawing on psychological concepts and constructs. These psychological explanations or causal attributions were grouped into one or more of eight categories: alcohol and drug abuse, biological or sexual drive, psychopathology, dysfunctional family upbringing, stress and trauma, character or personality trait, emotional state, and loss of control. The causal attributions in all categories systematically reformulated deliberate acts of violence into non-deliberate and non-violent acts. Psychologizing attributions, that is, causal attributions that functioned to conceal the violence and mitigate the perpetrator's responsibility, accounted for 9 7 percent of attributions. Through line-by-line analyses of the full text of one judgment, we show how psychologizing attributions are combined in use with other linguistic devices to (i) conceal violence, (ii) mitigate perpetrators' responsibility, (iii) conceal victims' resistance, and (iv) blame or pathologize victims.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,DISCOURSE;LAW;RAPE;RESISTANCE;RESPONSIBILITY;SEXUAL ASSAULT;VICTIM;BLAMING;VIOLENCE;Crime,,

Analysts have a tendency to use more general, i.e. Simplifying, constructions such as destructiveness, psychosis or death instinct as explanatory models. In the authors' view, these constructions in the end evade rather than mirror clinical reality. More recent research points to promising possibilities of differentiation, e.g. Psychotic mechanisms which are-as yet undiscussed-based on freud notion of the partial `rent in the relation between ego and external world'. These findings emphasize the restitutive function of a symptom or disturbance, i.e. Destruction of a relationship which hinders the therapeutic process and which is not understood initially, instead of solely stressing the destructive meaning in a tabooing gesture. The concept of performance attempts to replace simplifying models with a discriminant process, and will be preliminarily defined and explained in delineation to terms already in use such as acting out, enactment, and role responsiveness. The authors explore the question of how the perception of unthought certainty in the performance can either be recognized as a blueprint, i.e. Organizing activity, or as the destruction of the relationship so that a new one can emerge. The evidence from a detailed clinical example shows that many treatments can fail at this point and demonstrates how an understanding of performance in this sense offers a chance for integrating processes that otherwise impede treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,ACTING OUT;ACTION THOUGHT;ANNIHILATION;CUMULATIVE OPENING SCENE;;DEATH INSTINCT;DESTRUCTIVENESS IN THE ANALYTIC PROCESS;ENACTMENT;OPENING SCENE;SCENIC UNDERSTANDING;UNTHOUGHT KNOWN;WORKING THROUGH IN;THE TRANSFERENCE AND COUNTERTRANSFERENCE,,

Methods: to investigate this, 91 healthy participants completed attributional style questionnaire and performed three working memory (wm) tasks, which associated with different functions of wm (i.e. Central executive system (ces) and visuospatial sketchpad). Results: the results demonstrated that negative attributions contribute to the impairment in cognitive tasks which is associated with spatial working memory rather than main central executive functions (i.e. Switching and inhibition). Conclusions: it is concluded that negative attributions may selectively disrupt spatial working memory functions, thus a detrimental effect of negative attributions may be task specific.

Here, we review and critically analyze recent evidence to suggest that vmpfc abnormalities could similarly underlie deficient tagging of personal relevance in drug addiction, evidenced by a constellation of behaviors encompassing drug-biased attention, negative outcome insensitivity, self-report/behavior dissociation, and social inappropriateness. This novel framework might clarify, for example, why drug-addicted individuals often ruin long-standing relationships or forego important job opportunities while continuing to engage in uncontrolled drug-taking. Therapeutic interventions targeting personal relevance and associated vmpfc functioning could enhance self-awareness and facilitate more adaptive behavior in this chronically relapsing psychopathology.

Attribution-related cognitions of 68 3785 yr old spouses of 21 institutionalized and 47 at-home patients were obtained. An unpredictable upsetting behavior by the ad patient and significant life change experienced by the caregiver as a result of spouse's ad provided the situational contexts for semi-structured interview. Results indicate that only globality was related to depression related to the ad patient's unpredictable behavior; both globality and stability were related to depression for s's life-change situation. The pattern of the other depressogenic coping cognitions was also different for the 2 contexts: while ratings of upset and lack of current and future control were related to depression related to the ad patient's behavior, ratings of poor current and future coping, lack of coping success, and coping dissatisfaction were related to depression resulting from s's life-change context.

Differences in health status between diagnostic groups within cardiology have only been sparsely investigated. These outcomes may predict morbidity, mortality, labour market affiliation and healthcare utilisation in various diagnostic groups. A national survey aiming to include all cardiac diagnostic groups from a total heart centre population has been designed as the denheart survey. Methods and analysis: denheart is designed as a cross-sectional survey with a register-based follow-up. All diagnostic groups at the five national heart centres are included during 1 year (15 april 2013 to 15 april 2014) and asked to fill out a questionnaire at hospital discharge. The total eligible population, both responders and non-responders, will be followed in national registers. The following instruments are used: sf-12, hospital anxiety and depression scale, eq-5d, brief illness perception questionnaire (b-ipq), heartqol and edmonton symptom assessment scale. The following variables are collected from national registers: action diagnosis, procedures, comorbidity, length of hospital stay, type of hospitalisation, visits to general practitioners and other agents in primary healthcare, dispensed prescription medication, vital status and cause of death. Labour market affiliation, sick leave, early retirement pension, educational degree and income will be collected from registers. Frequency distributions and multiple logistic regression analyses will be used to describe and assess differences in patient reported outcomes at hospital discharge between diagnostic groups and in-hospital predicting factors. Cox proportional hazards regression models with age as the time scale will be used to investigate associations between patient reported outcomes at baseline and morbidity/mortality, labour market affiliation and healthcare utilisation after 1 year. Ethics and dissemination: the study complies with the declaration of helsinki. The study has been approved by the danish data protection agency: 2007-58-0015/30-0937 and registered at clinicaltrials.gov (nct01926145).

Evidence further suggests that high-ee relatives tend to make more blaming attributions for the patient's illness than do low-ee relatives. Few studies, however, have examined other important variables that predict family members' ee and attributions. Using a tri-ethnic sample of 57 relatives of patients with schizophrenia, this study finds that greater educational attainment in family members predicts less blameworthy attributions towards patients. Specifically, for whites and hispanics, greater educational attainment predicts less blameworthy self-reported causal attributions. For blacks, education does not relate to attributions. A content analysis of relatives' causal attributions further reveals that, regardless of ethnicity or education, biological factors are most often cited as having caused relatives' schizophrenia.

rayyan-470329670,Psychological And Developmental Differences Between Students Who Withdraw From College For Personal-Psychological Reasons And Continuing Students,2001,1,1,NA,,,,,WASSERMAN KN,,,,,"Higher education helps students fulfill developmental needs, direct and control different life phases, and locate the resources necessary to make changes in their lives (marienau & chickering, 1982). The college setting helps promote developmental changes that allow students to move their lives in chosen directions (chickering, 1967a). Specifically, during college, student growth occurs in the areas of developing competence, managing emotions, developing autonomy, establishing identity, freeing interpersonal relationships, developing purpose, and developing integrity (reisser, 1995). Compared to those who withdraw from college, students who persist in college show greater accomplishment on these developmental tasks (chickering, 1974). Research indicates that college dropouts are also more personally troubled than are students who stay in school (houston, 1970). Dropout and continuing students may also differ with regard to attributional styles used to assess life events. Specifically, students who attribute internal, global, stable causes for bad events are at-risk for depression and perhaps for college dropout (hirsch and keniston, 1970). Students leave college for various reasons, and the literature often does not distinguish between students who leave college for one reason compared to students who leave for another purpose. In addition to students who leave college because of academic difficulty or failure, there are students who withdraw for personal-psychological reasons. This latter group of students has not been studied separately from other types of dropouts. This study compared 25 students who left school for personal-psychological reasons to 25 continuing students in their accomplishment of student developmental tasks, attributional styles, and personal concerns. Results of this study suggested possible potential proactive interventions for students who are at risk for withdrawal for personal-psychological reasons. Due to the study's limitations, however, the reader should be cautious about drawing conclusions from findings.

Twenty-three currently depressed and 31 never-depressed participants completed the attributional styles questionnaire and wore an actigraph during the course of 1 week. Linear and logistic regression techniques were used to calculate path coefficients to test the mediating relationship. Results indicated that a global attributional style mediated the relationship between poor sleep continuity (frequency of awakenings), delayed morning waketime, increased total time spent in bed, and depression. Reverse mediation analyses indicated that these relationships may be bidirectional. No effects were found for stable or internal attributions. These results suggest that global attributions may, in part, mediate the relationship between sleep disturbances and depression. They also provide data consistent with the hypothesis that disrupted sleep is associated with learned helplessness.

rayyan-470329673,Breaking The Barriers To Optimal Glycaemic Control--What Physicians Need To Know From Patients' Perspectives.,2002,1,1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE. SUPPLEMENT,,,,,SNOEK FJ,,,,,"Diabetes is a largely self-managed disease with a major psychosocial impact on the lives of patients and their families. Coping effectively with the stresses related to living with and having to manage diabetes on a daily basis is not a simple function of education, i.e., knowing ""what is right for you."" Clearly, knowledge is a prerequisite, but in no way a guarantee, of making the recommended changes in self-care necessary to achieve optimal glycaemic control. To understand patients' self-care behaviour, we need to take into account various psychological and social factors. Behavioural research findings underscore the role of attitudes and illness beliefs as determinants of patients' health behaviours. For example, misperceptions regarding the seriousness and controllability of diabetes can inhibit active participation of the patient in the treatment. A reluctance to start insulin therapy can be observed in patients with type 2 diabetes who have poor glycaemic control on maximum dosage of oral hypoglycaemic agents. This phenomenon of ""psychological insulin resistance"" clearly demonstrates how even irrational beliefs can impact health outcomes. Misconceptions about having to start insulin treatment (""now i am seriously ill"") are often linked to negative emotions, e.g. Anger and fear. Negativistic attitudes and low self-efficacy expectations are not uncommon among people with diabetes, precipitated and maintained by repeated experiences of failure to ""master"" the diabetes and achieve satisfactory diabetes control. Ultimately, cumulative negative experiences can result in a state of ""learned helplessness"" or ""diabetes burnout."" Relational conflicts and lack of social support can also seriously hamper patients' self-care behaviours. In addition, contextual factors such as financial barriers and difficulty with access to health care influence peoples' self-care behaviours. In diabetes care, a bio-psychosocial approach to the patient and his or her coping problems is warranted. Learning to understand the patient's perspective will help health care professionals communicate more effectively and tailor the treatment to the needs of the individual.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,ADAPTATION;PSYCHOLOGICAL*;BLOOD GLUCOSE*;DIABETES MELLITUS/*PSYCHOLOGY;ANXIETY/ETIOLOGY;ATTITUDE OF HEALTH PERSONNEL;ATTITUDE TO HEALTH;COST OF ILLNESS;DEPRESSION/ETIOLOGY;DIABETES MELLITUS/PREVENTION & CONTROL;HEALTH BEHAVIOR;HUMANS;INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS;PATIENT CARE TEAM;PATIENT COMPLIANCE;STRESS;PSYCHOLOGICAL/ETIOLOGY,,

The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm) system has certain limitations when applied to two south african examples of dissociation, because it is descriptive (non-explanatory) and focuses on intrapsychic (non-communal) processes. Even the existing western explanatory models of dissociation fail to accommodate fully the communal aspects of dissociation in our south african context. Objectives and methods. The aim was to explore an expanded perspective on dissociation that does not limit it to an intrapsychic phenomenon, but that accounts for the interrelatedness of individuals within their social context. Auto-ethnography was used. In this article a collective, socially orientated, contextual hermeneutic was applied to two local examples of dissociation. Three existing western models were expanded along multicontextual, collective lines, for them to be more useful in the pluralistic south african context. Results. This preliminary contextual model of dissociation includes a person's interpersonal, socio-cultural, and spiritual contexts, in addition to the intrapsychic context. Dissociation is considered to be a normal information-processing tool that maintains balanced, coherent selves-in-society, i.e. Individuals connected to each other. In the south african context dissociation appears mostly as a normal phenomenon and seldom as a sign of mental illness. Dissociation is pivotal for the normal construction of individual and communal identities in the face of conflicting sets of information from various contexts. Dissociation may help individuals or communities to survive in a world of conflicting messages, where conflict is often interpersonal/cultural/societal in nature, rather than primarily intrapsychic. Conclusions. This model should be developed and evaluated further. Such evaluation would require suitable new local terminology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Heart Block,,

It also aims to describe how depression prevention and treatment policies were developed and put into practice in china, along with the associated facilitators and barriers.methodswe integrated two data sources using a case study approach: a document review of relevant policy documents, published articles and reports between 2004 and 2022 (n = 12 papers) and in-depth interviews (n = 41). Participants were drawn from pertinent sectors to managing depression: research and academia, relevant government departments, health care providers, people with depression and their families, and community organisations. Thematic analysis was used to analyse all data.resultsa comprehensive programme of work exploring specific services for depression prevention and treatment was developed in china in 2020. Facilitators of policy development and implementation include (1) political commitment and strong leadership, (2) coordination mechanisms, (3) stakeholder enthusiasm and commitment, (4) resources, and (5) the use of digital technologies. The main barriers leading to delays in policy development and implementation include (1) insufficient awareness and lack of depression literacy, (2) lack of resources and (3) stigma and social discrimination (4) lack of united action.conclusionalthough the process of implementing a distinctive service programme for depression prevention and treatment in china has been long, the current policy is in line with current global efforts. Strategies to reduce stigma and increase knowledge about depression are part of a national and international approach to reducing the burden of depression.

Anthropological research has helped to shape the field of addiction science, e.g. Ethnographic studies show that the lived worlds and self-identities of drug users have cultural order and socially constructed purpose and meaning, and experiential research shows that some addictions or aspects of addictions can be affirmative, creative and sustainable, at least at the individual level.

Distress tolerance has been measured in a number of different ways in the literature. Although there is variability in the exact form of assessment in youth samples, each of the conceptualizations has a consistent underlying theme. Specifically, and as discussed in the chapters throughout this volume, distress tolerance involves individual differences in the capacity to tolerate aversive internal states (e.g., pain, negative emotions, and body sensations). Anxiety sensitivity is defined as an individual difference in beliefs about the consequences of anxiety, specifically that anxiety sensations (e.g., jitteriness, racing heartbeat) have severe and negative consequences. Anxiety sensitivity might be seen as a specific form of distress tolerance where high anxiety sensitivity involves a decreased capacity to tolerate anxiety states and sensations and, conversely, low anxiety sensitivity involves an increased tolerance for anxiety sensations. Similar to the affect regulation conceptualization of distress tolerance, youth with high anxiety sensitivity are unable or (less likely) to tolerate anxiety-related emotional experience. Elevated anxiety sensitivity is a risk factor for the development of panic attacks, panic disorder, and other anxiety disorders. Anxiety sensitivity may tap emotional avoidance and affect regulation in a similar manner to more broad conceptualizations/assessments of distress tolerance. In the remainder of this chapter, the developmental assessment of anxiety sensitivity is discussed and studies on the validity of the construct, including longitudinal studies and cultural variations, are reviewed.

Bivariate correlations and multiple linear regressions were conducted to assess relationships between the attribution styles questionnaire (asq), clinical variables, and sf within the clinical group. Differences between groups were found for most of attributional dimensions. A 'pessimistic style' predicted depression within the clinical group. An unstable attribution bias predicted positive symptoms. General psychopathology and a global attribution style predicted 50% of the variance in general sf.

Fifty-six patients who were receiving outpatient psychiatric care gave their consent to fill out questionnaires designed to assess symptomatology, awareness of illness, and self-serving bias (ssb), which is a tendency to excessively attribute positive events to internal causes. Questionnaires were successfully completed by 44 patients (31 males and 13 females between the ages of 18 and 62). The following measures were used: positive and negative symptoms scale (panss), scale to assess unawareness of mental disorders (sumd), and attributional style questionnaire (asq). The results showed that emotional discomfort, which is directly related to the depressive syndrome, and the cognitive syndrome were significantly associated with a reversed ssb (tendency to excessively attribute positive events to external causes and negative events to internal causes). Emotional discomfort accounted for 23.5\% of the variance in reversed ssb and the cognitive syndrome for 9.7\% of the variance in reversed ssb. No relationship was found to exist between unawareness of illness and ssb. These findings reveal that in patients with schizophrenia, reversed ssb is closely related to the presence of depressive symptoms. (C) 2006 elsevier ireland ltd.

This study aims to explore frail older adults' experiences of self-managing symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Design qualitative semi-structured interviews, exploring experiences of depression and/or anxiety, ways participants self-managed these and the contexts within which this took place. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants 28 frail older adults in the united kingdom, purposively sampled for neighbourhood, frailty and symptoms of anxiety/depression. Analysis thematic analysis to inductively derive themes from the data. Results our findings suggest that frail older adults find maintaining independence, engaging in meaningful activities, and socialising and peer support important for self-managing depression and anxiety. These could all be adapted to the level of frailty experienced. Drawing on life experiences, addressing the perceived cause and faith were helpful in some situations and for some personalities. Distraction and avoidance were helpful for more severe symptoms or where the causes of symptoms could not be resolved. Self-management strategies were less well-established for anxiety symptoms, especially when linked to newer health fears and worries about the future. Conclusions developing services and sources of information that support and facilitate key therapeutic components of self-management, which align with older adults' preferred coping styles and take into account levels of frailty, may be a way of supporting frail older people waiting for mental health treatments or those who prefer not to access these. Greater awareness of anxiety and how it can be self-managed in frail older people is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Frail Elderly;Great Britain;Anxiety,,

Yet the influence of religious denomination as it affects coping methods and/or as an explanatory model for illness and treatment remains to be determined. This study aims (1) to investigate if religious denomination is associated with explanatory models, (2) to assess the evolution over time of these explanatory models, and (3) to examine the relationship between these explanatory models and the spiritual vision of treatment and adhesion to such treatment. Sampling and methods: of an initial cohort of 115 outpatients, 80\% (n = 92) participated in a 3-year follow-up study. The evolution of their religious explanatory models was assessed in order to evaluate if religious denomination, as a meaning-making coping tool, is associated with the patients' explanatory models. Finally, we examined the relationship between these representations and the patients' spiritual visions of treatment and treatment adhesion. Results: a spiritual vision of the illness (as part of an explanatory model) was more frequent in patients with psychosis for whom the subjective dimension of religion was important. However, there was no association between the patients' religious denomination and their spiritual vision of the illness. The analyses showed that the various contents of spiritual visions of illness were not positive or negative per se; instead, they depended on how this religious vision was integrated into the person's experience. Examining longitudinal aspects of coping showed that the spiritual vision sometimes changed, but was not associated with clinical or social outcome. Conclusions: for patients with psychosis, explanatory models frequently involve a religious component which is independent of denomination and likely to change over time. Clinicians should address this issue on a regular basis, by asking patients about their explanatory model before trying to build a bridge with the medical model. Copyright (c) 2010 s.

More efficacious treatments have lengthened overall survival, but these treatments often result in a myriad of symptoms and financial burden that may negatively impact perceptions of cancer treatment and medication-taking behavior. Purpose to explore cancer treatment-specific medication beliefs among women undergoing cancer treatment for mbc. Methods a qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews that were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was conducted using atlas.ti 8.0 software. Inter-rater reliability was set at a threshold of 0.80. Participants were recruited from a national cancer institute-designated comprehensive care center. Eligibility included >= 18 years old, english speaking, confirmed mbc diagnosis, and able/willing to complete interviews via telephone or zoom. Results participants (n = 16) were largely caucasian (86.7\%) and non-hispanic (93.3\%). Mean age was 55.62 years. Three major themes were revealed, with corresponding subthemes: (1) positive cancer treatment-specific medication beliefs highlighting the benefit of treatment (relief of cancer-related symptoms and medication efficacy: delayed disease progression/extended survival); (2) negative cancer treatment-specific medication beliefs that caused concern for cancer treatment (medication symptoms, side effects and drug-drug interactions, financial toxicity, lack of guarantee medication would work); and (3) dialectical cancer treatment-specific medication beliefs indicating the benefits of cancer treatment outweigh the risks. Conclusion overall, participants noted that the benefits of cancer treatment outweighed the risks in the context of metastatic disease. Participants understood their prognosis and that they depended on their cancer treatment for survival. Oncology providers should continue to assess and address medication beliefs over the treatment trajectory and assist mbc patients with the decisional balance between the risk and benefit of continued cancer treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,METASTATIC BREAST CANCER;MEDICATION BELIEFS;CANCER TREATMENT;PERCEPTIONS;Breast Neoplasms,,

In study 2 (n = 72), participants were divided into mortality salience and control conditions and exposed to success or failure in a cognitive task. Then, their attributions for the obtained outcome and task performance were assessed. In study 3 (n = 100), participants were exposed to mortality salience or control conditions, they were given or not given the opportunity to report attributions, and death-thought accessibility was assessed. Mortality salience led to more self-serving attributions than a control condition and these attributions were related to better emotional state and task performance. In addition, the opportunity to report causal attributions reduced death-thought accessibility following mortality salience.

This study aimed to (1) estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation (si) in epidemiologically-ascertained, population-based, samples of children with asd or autism spectrum screening questionnaire (assq) screen positivity (asp); (2) determine whether asd/asp is an independent risk factor for si, controlling for known si risk factors; and, (3) develop an explanatory model for si in children with asd/asp. Methods participants came from three epidemiologically-ascertained samples of school-aged korean children (n = 14,423; 3,702; 4,837). Assq >= 14 was the cutoff for asp. A subsample (n = 86) was confirmed to have asd. Si was based on parents' endorsement of items on the behavioral assessment system for children-2-parent report scale-children. Logistic regressions were used to assess associations between si and asd/asp, controlling for demographics, peer victimization, behavior problems, and depression. To develop an explanatory model for si within asd/asp, the associations between si and child characteristics (comorbid conditions, asd symptoms, iq, adaptive function) were tested. Results si was higher in children with asd (14\%) and asp (16.6-27.4\%) than assq screen negative (asn) peers (3.4-6.9\%). Asd/asp was strongly predictive of si (ors: 2.87-5.67), after controlling for known si risk factors compared to asn. Within the asd and asp groups, anxiety was the strongest predictor of si. Conclusions si prevalence was higher in non-clinical samples of children with asd and asp, relative to asn peers. These results underscore the need for routine screening for si in children with asd and social difficulties, particularly those with high anxiety.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,"ANXIETY;ASD;ASP;EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SAMPLE;SUICIDALITY;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive;Suicide;Autistic Disorder",,

The present article extends recent work in philosophy of science by proposing a framework called mechanistic science as a promising way forward. This approach maintains that integrating psychological and biological phenomena involves demonstrating how psychological functions are implemented in biological structures. Successful early attempts to advance mechanistic explanations of psychological phenomena are reviewed, and lessons are derived to show how the framework can be applied to a range of clinical psychological phenomena, including gene by environment findings, computational models of reward processing in schizophrenia, and self-related processes in personality pathology. Pursuing a mechanistic approach can ultimately facilitate more productive and successful collaborations across a range of disciplines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Ian""=>""Included""}",,AUTONOMY;CAUSAL EXPLANATION;LEVELS OF ANALYSIS;MECHANISM;;PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,,

Method: a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was used to gain an in-depth and contextual understanding of the perspectives of five patients with pnes. Data collection and analysis were followed by an inductive and interpretive approach informed by the principles of thematic analysis. Results: explanatory models and prototypes were identified from the patients' narratives. Four patients related their suffering regarding psychosocial causes-family conflicts, sexual harassment, and life changes, among others-. Hereditary and organic hypotheses appeared to be unspecific. Folk explanations were common to all participants (magic, witchcraft, energetic causes). Four patients used the term epilepsy as an illness prototype, focusing on seizures and the use of antiepileptic drugs. Three of them also compared their illness to other people's ``attacks'' (heart attacks, panic attacks, nervous breakdown). Only one of them referred to someone who was suspected of having epilepsy. Conclusion: patients' psychosocial explanatory models are different from the results of previous studies because these studies indicate that most patients support somatic explanations. Patients also use folk explanations related to traditional medicine, which highlights the interpersonal aspects of the disease. Doctor-patient communication is essential for a correct understanding of pnes, resulting in better outcomes. It could also help to reduce the cultural distance between professionals and patients, leading to narrowing inequalities present in multicultural healthcare services.

It explores a number of dimensions of recovery including clinical, existential, functional, physical, and social. The women described engaging in ``survival'' recovery in the short term and ``thriving'' recovery in the long term, with survival strategies extending into the thriving phase of recovery during their complex path to it. The survival recovery phase included accessing culturally sensitive mental health care and obtaining social and instrumental support to help ensure safety, manage stress, and treat psychiatric symptoms. The thriving phase of recovery was described as involving six components: developing an explanatory model with their health care provider; undertaking a process of narrative reflection and prioritizing self-care; engaging in interdisciplinary care team support; engaging the support of family and friends; exploring spiritual and existential supports; and creating goals for the future and a sense of mastery. Through these six avenues, the women began to experience a sense of self-efficacy and agency that improved their ability to cope with stress and pressure, leading to building a life with meaning. The interviews provided insights into how clinical care can be improved and how practitioners can implement a more recovery-oriented approach to practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,CANADIAN;CHINESE;QUALITATIVE;RECOVERY;SUICIDE;THRIVING;Suicide,,

This study explored the nature of the relations between parents' attributions and their emotional and behavioral responses to their young autistic children, with the goal of illuminating parental belief constructs that produce adaptive or maladaptive parenting responses. A five-part survey was mailed out in an urban school district to parents with children who have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. The children ranged from 3 years, 4 months to 5 years, 6 months of age. A total of thirty-three parents participated in the study. Results indicated that parents who did not attribute responsibility for challenging parenting situations to child ability were more likely to report positive emotional responses. No significant relationships were identified between parental attributions and negative emotional response, adaptive behavioral response and maladaptive behavioral response. Parents with older children were more likely to report positive emotional responses. Negative emotional responses were more common when parents reported more severe autism symptoms in their child. While no significant relationships were identified with adaptive behavioral responses, parents whose children were older at age of symptom instigation and autism diagnosis reported more maladaptive behavioral responses. Parents experiencing positive emotional responses were more likely to report adaptive behavioral responses, and less likely to report maladaptive behavioral responses. Parents experiencing negative emotional responses were more likely to report maladaptive behavioral responses. Implications for parental efficacy, intervention, and family outcome were discussed.

How Background Knowledge Affects Causal Attributions For Ambiguous Stroke Symptoms,2019,1,1,BRAIN INJURY,,,,,GALLAGHER J and MCCLURE J and MCDOWALL J,,,,,"Primary objective: people often misattribute stroke survivors' symptoms to other causes such as their personality, especially when the survivors are young. As a result, these stroke survivors experience feelings of resentment towards and from their acquaintances, and may struggle to retain employment. This study aimed to clarify how people's misattributions for stroke symptoms were affected by varying information about the stroke. Methods: experiment 1 examined whether the stroke survivor's age (72, 32 or unstated) and the information about the person's stroke (no information, explicit stroke or implied stroke) influenced participants' causal attributions for the stroke survivor's four ambiguous symptoms, such as fatigue. Experiment 2 examined the effect of the rapidity (a week or a year) with which the symptoms appeared. Results: when the scenario explicitly referred to stroke, participants attributed the ambiguous symptoms more to stroke, whereas when it did not mention stroke, participants attributed these symptoms more to other factors. When stroke was merely implied by reference to unilateral paralysis, participants rated stroke the best explanation when the target person was 72 but not when he was 32. Experiment 2 showed that stating that the symptoms happened rapidly heightened attributions to stroke in the 72-year-old but not the 32-year-old. Conclusions: these findings show how different information about stroke survivors affect people's attributions for survivors' behaviour; this has important implications for accurate diagnosis and effective rehabilitation that targets these attributions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,STROKE SURVIVORS;INVISIBLE CONDITIONS;MISCONCEPTIONS;CAUSAL;ATTRIBUTIONS;AGE;REHABILITATION;Causality,,

However, confrontations can also result in negative reactions from the confronted such as hostility or withdrawal. Across three studies (one experiment focused on anti-black racism and two survey studies in which retrospective incidents of any type of racism were collected), we examine the extent to which the focus of a confrontation is associated with immediate constructive (i.e., prosocial) or destructive (i.e., antisocial, withdrawal/avoidant) responses. Specifically, we examine the differential effects of confronting racism in a way that focuses on the specific, temporary, and external behaviors enacted by the individual (behavior-focused) compared to focusing on the global, stable, and internal attributes of the person (person-focused). Across three studies we find converging evidence that behavior-focused confrontations are associated with more prosocial responses (e.g., self-improvement plans, appreciation) and that person-focused confrontations are associated with more antisocial and withdrawal/avoidant responses (e.g., hostility, avoidance). In study 3, we find that interpersonal motivations (i.e., benevolence, revenge) and relationship repair efficacy help explain the effects of confrontation focus. We also find that the race of the confronter was not a significant moderator of findings, but we see some differences when comparing confronting anti-black racism to confronting other types of racism (studies 2 and 3). These results suggest that confrontation focus, and associated interpersonal motivations and beliefs, are important to understanding responses to prejudice confrontations.

Clinicians must therefore decide about providing causal information without knowing how it will impact on patient and treatment. This study investigates the effect of causal models on different aspects of treatment motivation. Methods: in an experimental online study healthy individuals (n = 461) were instructed to imagine experiencing psychotic symptoms and seeking professional help. The imagination was supported by an audio play cover story. Subsequently, participants were randomized to four conditions differing in the content of the causal model given for the occurring symptoms (biological, psychological, combined and no causal explanation). Results: different causal models impacted on different aspects of treatment motivation: participants who had received a biological causal model showed high willingness to take medication, whereas participants who had received a psychological model reported high perceived personal control over symptoms. Participants who had received a causal model that combined biological and psychological aspects reported high acceptance of medication and high motivation to undergo treatment by this clinician. Conclusions: the results underline the impact the content of a causal model may have on patients' treatment motivation and - as a consequence - on treatment success. Overall, the integration of psychological and biological aspects within a causal model seems most promising in terms of adherence to various types of treatment. (C) 2011 elsevier ltd.

In addition, results showed that women were significantly more likely to endorse physical and biological reasons for their depression compared with men. Gender moderated the relationship between physical reasons for depression and medication beliefs, such that men endorsing physical reasons found antidepressants less acceptable and had more negative beliefs about medication compared to women. Conclusions: findings indicate that depressed men and women in the hospital may have differing views about the causes of their depression and this may affect the acceptability of treatments. Depression treatment in inpatient settings should be better personalised to match the beliefs of individual patients.

The two theories guiding this investigation are the integrated hopelessness self-esteem theory of depression (metalsky, joiner, hardin, & abramson, 1993) and the recovery model (needles & abramson, 1990). Attributional style for positive events, depression, and self-esteem were assessed in a sample of 477 7th and 8th graders twice over a 4-month period. Results indicate significant correlations between attributional style and self-esteem, as well as significant correlations between atttributional style and depression for both boys and girls, although the correlation was stronger for girls. The results also indicate a significant correlation between self-esteem and depression for both boys and girls. In the test of separate models, moderation was not supported. Results of the mediation analysis indicate mediation of self-esteem in the relationship between attributional style for positive events and depression for girls, boys, and the full sample.

The aim of this is study was to explore the roles of both the patient's and caregivers' resilience and posttraumatic stress in pediatric burn survivor adjustment. For the purposes of the study, ``51 patient-parent/guardian'' dyads participated. Patients answered the resilience questionnaire for children and adolescents, and caregivers answered the mexican resilience scale and the davidson trauma scale. The roles of patient age, time since the burn, and size of burn injury were also considered. Statistical analyses included spearman's. For correlations and structural equation modeling. P less than .05 was considered significant. Patients and caregivers reported high levels of resilience, and the majority of caregivers reported low severity of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Pediatric burn survivors' resilience was associated with being younger at the time of the burn and less severity of intrusive and avoidance symptoms in caregivers; it was also associated with a higher resilience in caregivers. It can be concluded that psychological responses of caregivers of pediatric burn survivors affect the well being and positive adjustment of patients; thus psychological services for caregivers would likely have a double benefit for both caregivers and patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Burns;Survivors,,

Internationally, estimates of rates of depression in this population are very wide (14.6\% to 88\%). The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of depression and the independent predictors of referral for psychiatric hospitalisation in young people (aged 16 to 25 years) following an index episode of hospital treated deliberate self-poisoning. Method: a retrospective cohort study design (n = 1410), with data drawn from a population-based clinical case register. Unadjusted and adjusted estimates of predictors of referral for psychiatric admission (after-care) used logistic regression models. Results: prevalence of any depression diagnosis was 35.5\% (n = 500); and 25.4\% (n = 358) were referred for a psychiatric admission. The adjusted estimates for predictors of psychiatric inpatient referral were: high suicidal level (or 118.21: ci 95\% 63.23-220.99), low/moderate suicidal level (14.27: 9.38-21.72), any depression (2.88: 1.97-4.22), any psychosis (4.06; 1.15-14.36), older age (1.12: 1.04-1.21), and number of support people (0.88: 0.78-0.98). Conclusion: depression was diagnosed in more than a third and was an independent predictor of psychiatric inpatient referral, so service providers need to account for this level of need in the provision of assessment and after-care services. Evidence-based guidelines for psychiatric inpatient after-care for deliberate self-poisoning and/or depression in young people are limited. Our explanatory model included suicidal level, depression, psychosis, older age, and available support persons, suggesting that the treating clinicians were making these discharge decisions for admission in keeping with those limited guidelines, although the balance of benefits and harms of psychiatric hospitalisation are not established. Future research examining patient experiences, effectiveness of psychiatric hospitalisation, and alternatives to hospitalisation is warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,"SELF-POISONING;SELF-HARM;SUICIDE ATTEMPT;DEPRESSION;PSYCHIATRIC;HOSPITALISATION;Poisoning;Hospitals, Psychiatric;Prevalence",,
rayyan-470329708,The Impact Of Causal Attribution On Stigmatizing Attitudes Toward A Person Who Stutters,2016,1,1,JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,,,,,BOYLE MP,,,,,"Purpose: this study investigated the impact of providing low control (biological) and high control (psychobehavioral) causal explanations for stuttering on a variety of stigma related variables including blame, anger, social distance, stereotypes, dislike, sympathy, willingness to help, and perceptions of potential for recovery for a hypothetical person who stutters. Method: one hundred and sixty-five university students read one of three vignettes describing a person who stutters with different descriptions about the cause of stuttering (low control, high control, and a control group in which no explanation was given) and answered a series of self-report measures assessing stigmatizing attitudes and perceived potential for recovery. Results: the controllable explanation for stuttering led to more blame compared to the uncontrollable explanation and no explanation. The controllable explanation resulted in higher levels of anger and stereotypes compared to no explanation. There were no significant differences between uncontrollable explanations and no explanation on any of the stigma related variables of interest. Uncontrollable explanations increased prognostic pessimism compared to controllable explanations. Self-reported familiarity and closeness with people who stutter was significantly related to more positive attitudes toward a hypothetical person who stutters. Conclusions: reducing the belief that stuttering is ultimately caused by psychobehavioral factors will reduce blame toward people who stutter. However, providing biological explanations for stuttering is not effective for reducing stigma compared to no explanation at all, and could increase prognostic pessimism. Biological explanations for stuttering should be provided to inform clients and society about current research findings, however this information must be given carefully and be balanced with evidence that people who stutter can make great progress with appropriate, personalized therapy that addresses the multidimensionality of the disorder. Learning outcomes: as a result of reading this paper, readers should be able to: (1) describe how causal attributions impact attitudes toward individuals with disabilities (2) summarize the effects of providing a biological explanation for stuttering on stigmatizing attitudes toward a person who stutters (3) summarize the effects of providing a psychobehavioral explanation for stuttering on stigmatizing attitudes toward a person who stutters, (4) discuss how familiarity and closeness toward people who stutter relates to stigmatizing attitudes toward a person who stutters.

Significant group differences on the explanatory models were found. The lay people favoured crisis, sociological and medical models whereas the experts shared the belief in the medical, genetic and crisis models.

Individuals differ in their ability to do this. For example, difficulties in self-other attribution have been linked to positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, with causally ambiguous situations proving a universal challenge. The goal of the present study was to examine relationships between individual differences in resting-state functional connectivity and self-other attribution performance. Fifty-five healthy adults completed a resting-state fmri scan and an attribution task that involved tapping at irregular intervals while listening to a tone sequence. The likelihood that tones in the sequence corresponded to the participant's taps was systematically varied. Using group independent component analysis (ica) and dual regression, we found that connectivity between prefrontal networks associated with self-referential processing and regions sensitive to externally-generated stimuli was modulated by participants ability to accurately assess the proportion of tones belonging to self versus other. These findings shed additional light on the neural mechanisms of agency, emphasising that connectivity with prefrontal networks play an important role in self-other differentiation.

The authors examined the impact of causal explanations and diagnostic labeling on medical students' views of schizophrenia. Method medical students in their fifth and sixth years at the second university of naples (italy) who attended lectures from april through june 2010 completed a self-report questionnaire regarding their beliefs about the mental disorder described (but not named) in a case vignette depicting a person who meets the international classification of diseases-10 criteria for schizophrenia. Results of the 232 students invited, 194 (84\%) completed the questionnaire. Students most frequently cited heredity as the cause (81\%), followed by stress (69\%), psychological traumas (45\%), and misuse of street drugs (44\%). Most students (82\%) labeled the case ``schizophrenia''; a minority (24\%) believed that persons with the case vignette disorder could be well again. Both labeling the case as ``schizophrenia'' and naming heredity as the cause were independently associated with pessimism about the possibility of recovery and with the perception that ``others'' keep their distance from persons with this diagnosis. Heredity was more frequently cited by respondents who labeled the case schizophrenia and was significantly associated with students' perception that people with this diagnosis are unpredictable. Conclusions these findings confirm that, in a sample of medical students, biogenetic causal explanations and diagnostic labeling have negative effects on beliefs about schizophrenia.

In major depression, a significant emotion recognition impairment has been reported. It remains unclear whether the ability to recognize emotion from facial expressions is also impaired in anxiety disorders. There is a need to review and integrate the published literature on emotional expression recognition in anxiety disorders and major depression. Methodology/principal findings: a detailed literature search was used to identify studies on explicit emotion recognition in patients with anxiety disorders and major depression compared to healthy participants. Eighteen studies provided sufficient information to be included. The differences on emotion recognition impairment between patients and controls (cohens d) with corresponding confidence intervals were computed for each study. Over all studies, adults with anxiety disorders had a significant impairment in emotion recognition (d = -0.35). In children with anxiety disorders no significant impairment of emotion recognition was found (d = -0.03). Major depression was associated with an even larger impairment in recognition of facial expressions of emotion (d = -0.58).

The model builds on two simple insights: that the parties in a potentially trusting relationship are likely to view their interaction differently and that their attributions of each other's behavior will be self-servingly motivated. The model specifically focuses on the role of dependence in motivating attributions of trustworthiness, suggesting, for instance, that people ameliorate the anxiety associated with dependence by perceiving others as trustworthy. The model explains why trustors, contrary to the prescriptions of the dominant, rational choice approach, often engage in large, seemingly irrational acts of trust and when and why these acts, despite being tremendously risky, can be crucial to trust development. The paper explores the consequences of these insights for interpersonal interactions as well as touching on the potential for extensions to inter-organizational and international interactions.

The third section describes the history of such models from 1600 ad to 1900 ad. The fourth section describes the history of such models since 1900 ad. Over the last century, the number of new models has increased at a rate vastly greater than the rate preceding it. These new models have evolved from increased knowledge regarding learning, pharmacology, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy. Cogent clinical observations have led to our appreciating the mode of administration, the interactions and sometimes disconnections between treatment and recovery, and the coercive role of society in requiring sobriety under certain circumstances. Randomized controlled clinical trials have increased our knowledge of what interventions work, when, and with whom. This knowledge has increased our understanding of the addictions. Other and newer models will hopefully evolve in the coming decades to aid us in further understanding addiction.

rayyan-470329725,The Effects Of Safety Behaviors During Exposure Therapy For Anxiety: Critical Analysis From An Inhibitory Learning Perspective,2016,1,1,CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW,,,,,BLAKEY SM and ABRAMOWITZ JS,,,,,"In the context of clinical anxiety, safety behaviors are actions performed to prevent, escape, or minimize feared catastrophes and/or associated distress. Research consistently implicates safety behaviors in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders; accordingly, safety behaviors are traditionally eliminated during exposure treatments for pathological anxiety. The notion that safety behaviors are ubiquitously deleterious in the context of exposure has recently been challenged, yet findings regarding safety behaviors' effects on exposure outcomes are limited, mixed, and controversial. Furthermore, developments in explanatory models for exposure's effectiveness (e.g., inhibitory learning theory) highlight other possible consequences of safety behaviors performed during exposure. Unfortunately, these theoretical advances are neglected in experimental research. The present review critically examines the literature addressing the role of safety behaviors in exposure therapy from an inhibitory learning perspective. Limitations, future directions, and clinical recommendations are also discussed. (C) 2016 elsevier ltd.

Explanatory models of women's sexuality in the context of substance use are under study. This study aimed to explore how women's sexual behavior can become risky in the context of substance use.; Methods: in this ethnographic inquiry, 25 women with substance use disorders (suds) were included at two drop-in-centers (dics) in south tehran. Observation, semi-structured interviews and field notes were used to collect data. Qualitative content analysis was used to attain the explanatory model of women's sexual behaviors in the context of substance use.; Results: three major themes emerged from the data analysis regarding their lives in the context of substance use; 1) life in the context of drug abuse, 2) negative self-perception, and 3) strive to survive. Subthemes were identified as loss of contact with family, social stigma, self-forgetfulness, worthlessness, low self-efficacy, and unsafe sexual context.; Conclusion: findings suggest that women with suds are highly interwoven with women's sexual health, facilitating a shift towards risky behaviors.

Four studies, assessing over 500 participants, were completes. The studies differed with regard to the particular measure(s) of well-being; test-retest reliability of the aies was assessed in one study, and the attributional style questionnaire (asq) was administered in one study for comparison. Coefficients of internal consistency indicated adequate to superior reliability for basic and composite scales of the aies. Across studies, the controllability and composite scales were consistently and highly correlated with various measures of well-being. Further, regression analyses indicated that the aies, in accounting for variability in well-being, may incorporate and go beyond that due to attributions for external events.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Psychometrics,,
rayyan-470329728,A Network Theory Of Mental Disorders.,2017,1,1,WORLD PSYCHIATRY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE WORLD PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION (WPA),,,,,BORSBOOM D,,,,,"In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.

Basic pathways into care determine how and when help is sought and accepted. Between 70-90% of all illness episodes are treated in personal, social or folk sectors (klienman 1980). The relationship between patient's explanatory models and acceptance of treatment is well described (see bhui & bhugra 2002 for a discussion). Of late, an increased emphasis is being placed on patients' decision making (redelmeier 2001a, b). The patients must be empowered to make the decisions which affect their bodies and their functioning. In order to do so, the patients must be aware of the purpose of the decision. For psychiatric therapy to become patient centred, the focus must shift to not only the type of therapy but also quality of care indicators and communication style. The patients and their carers must give accurate information so that correct diagnosis can be made and appropriate therapeutic intervention instigated. Patients' ability to make decisions will depend upon their own personality, knowledge, past experience, education and other factors. It is up to the professional to help develop these if patients are to be handed true empowerment.

The first framework used a composite of stable/unstable, global/specific, and internal/external attributions for positive and negative events. The second framework used ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck attributions for positive and negative events. Participants were 185 elementary school children aged 8-12 years old. Results showed that the attribution approaches were significantly but modestly related, indicating that they are separate yet related constructs. Ability and task difficulty shared a high association, indicating that children may view them similarly. Results also showed that both approaches were significantly associated with depressive symptoms, even after taking the other into account. These findings suggest both attribution frameworks are useful for understanding childhood depression.

Alms: to examine psychological distress among kuwaiti women with infertility problems and explore the perceived causes of infertility. Methods: an arabic version of the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads) was used to examine the psychological status of 120 kuwaiti infertile women and an age-matched sample of 125 healthy pregnant women as a control group. Results: compared with age-matched pregnant control sample. The infertile women exhibited a significant higher psychopathology in all hads parameters in the form of tension, hostility, anxiety, depression, self-blame and suicidal ideation. The illiterate group attributed the causes of their infertility to supernatural causes such as evil spirits, witchcraft and god's retribution, while the educated group blamed nutritional, marital and psychosexual factors for their infertility. Faith and traditional healers were considered as the first treatment choice among illiterate women, while the educated women opted for an infertility clinic for treatment. Childlessness results in social stigmatization for infertile women and places them at risk of serious social and emotional consequences. Conclusions: the prevalence and severity of psychological distress in this sample of infertile kuwaiti women indicates the appropriateness of referring these patients for psychological evaluation. Successful programmes in dealing with infertility in kuwait need to include the establishment of a community based intervention strategy to educate people about infertility and to give guidelines for treatment options.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Increased self-advocacy skills have been shown to positively impact attributional style, self-esteem, depression, and academic performance (kistner, osborne, & leverrier, 1988; phillips, 1990; swanson, 1981; westervelt & johnson, 1998). However, a review of the literature reveals that few quantitative assessments of school-based intervention programs for learning disabled adolescents have been conducted. This study evaluated the effects of just do it, a summer school self-advocacy training program for incoming ninth grade learning disabled students. According to the just do it theoretical model, developing an adaptive attributional style through increasing one's sense of control over the environment is predicted to improve subsequent academic performance. If students develop a positive outlook and feel capable of succeeding, they are likely to demonstrate stronger academic performance. Additionally, increases in adaptive attributional style are hypothesized to affect academic performance by reducing depression and improving self-esteem. To evaluate these hypotheses, questionnaires assessing attributional style, depression, and self-esteem were administered to 83 learning disabled adolescents comprising two matched samples: those attending the just do it program (n = 43) and those not attending the program (n = 40). The questionnaires were administered prior to and following participation or non-participation in the program. Specific predictions were: (1) after the intervention, participants would demonstrate higher gpa, lower depression, higher self-esteem, and more adaptive attributional style than the control group, and (2) attributional style would mediate the effects of self-advocacy training on self-esteem, depression, and academic performance. Mixed factorial analyses of variance indicated that after exposure to the program, just do it participants demonstrated significantly more adaptive attributional style, positive self-esteem, and decreased depression than non-participants. Although there was no significant difference in academic performance for either group from eighth grade to ninth grade, a positive trend was noted for just do it participants. Further, no mediation relationship was found between attributional style and self-esteem and depression, although self-esteem and depression were negatively correlated. Recommendations for future research and implications for quantitative evaluation of educational programs are discussed.

Participants were 112 (45 women) emerging adults enrolled in a large, public university in upstate new york. Participants completed self-report measures on relational aggression and hostile attribution biases and performed an auditory perseveration task to elicit the p300. It was found that hostile attribution biases for relational provocation situations was associated with a larger p300 amplitude above and beyond the role of hostile attribution biases for instrumental situations, relational aggression, and gender. Larger p300 amplitude is interpreted to reflect greater allocation of cognitive resources or enhanced 'attending' to salient stimuli.

Methods: the revised illness perception questionnaire (ipq-r) was used in the present study. A cross-sectional, descriptive design was employed. The study was conducted in four major hospitals in guangzhou (china) with a sample of 193 mi patients. Pearson's and spearman's correlation, t test, one-way anova, factor analysis and multiple linear regression were used. Results: arming the 12 common symptoms of mi, on average only 3.37 were recognized by the subjects. Among the six factors of the cause dimension, ``immune factors'' received the highest score, followed by ``gene and chance'' ``behavioral factors'' ``psychological factors'' ``environmental factors'' and ``physical factors''. Subjects perceived mi as a chronic, cyclic illness with serious consequences that could be controlled through treatment, and believed that they had a negative affective response to mi. Furthermore, the dimensions of patients' ip were correlated, and illness-related factors and socio-demographic factors acted as predictors of ip. Conclusion: the ip of chinese patients with mi needs to be improved. Practice implications: based on our findings, effective interventions can be designed to promote mi patients' ip to facilitate their coping strategies after an episode of mi.

Research that has been conducted thus far indicates that those who are more religious or spiritual tend to have better mental and physical health. Abu-raiya and pargament concluded that the islamic faith provides comfort, meaning, identity, spirituality, and community for its followers. Two factors, positive religious coping and intrinsic religiosity, were noted to be consistently and positively linked to well-being outcomes. According to the research, muslims commonly use religious coping during tribulations and times of stress. Religious coping is generally defined as the 'process that people engage in to attain significance and meaning in stressful circumstances'. It may provide meaning to the tribulation and provide explanations for such concepts as suffering, good versus evil, and guilt. The more stressful the situation, the more likely people are to use religion to cope. This chapter presents muslims' conceptualizations of mental health and illness. It begins with a discussion of the causal explanations and purposes of mental illness, which covers a variety of issues. Prevention, healing, and treatment are considered with emphasis on clinical applications.

Achieving a better academic grade has been reported as the prime motivation for stimulant use and is an increasingly discussed topic. The proliferation of stimulant use for adhd has been a cause for public, medical and policy concern in australia. This paper explores individuals' perceptions of adhd, the meaning that the diagnosis carries for them and their attitudes to stimulant medication treatment. Methods: this qualitative study was underpinned by a social constructivist approach and involved semi-structured interviews with eight participants. The participants were parents of children with adhd or were adults who themselves had been diagnosed with adhd. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Results: there were three interrelated yet contradictory overarching themes: (i) an impairment to achieving success, which can be a double-edged sword, but has to be fixed; (ii) diagnosis as a relief that alleviates fault and acknowledges familial inheritance; (iii) responsibility to be normal and to fit in with societal expectations. Collectively, these perceptions and meanings were powerful drivers of stimulant use. Conclusions: paying attention to perceptions of adhd and reasons for seeking or not seeking stimulant treatment is important when planning appropriate interventions for this condition.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,ADHD;STIMULANT MEDICATION;QUALITATIVE STUDY;SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIVISM;;THEMATIC ANALYSIS;Western Australia;Australia,,

The present research was designed for two reasons: (a) to provide a clear demonstration that depressed individuals' predictions of the likelihood of future outcomes are more pessimistic than those of nondepressed individuals given identical information with which to make forecasts and identical conditions for forecasting, and (b) to test two additional hypotheses regarding possible mechanisms underlying depressives' relative pessimism in forecasting: a social-comparison and a differential attributional-style hypothesis. We used a modification of the cue-use paradigm developed by ajzen (1977, experiment 1) and examined depressed and nondepressed people's predictions of the likelihood of future positive and negative outcomes for themselves and for others. The results provided strong support for pessimism on the part of depressed individuals relative to nondepressed individuals in forecasts for both self and others. In addition, whereas nondepressives exhibited a self-enhancing bias in which they overestimated their probability of success and underestimated their probability of failure relative to that of similar others, depressives did not succumb to either positive or negative social comparison biases in prediction. Finally, in line with the attributional-style hypothesis, depressednondepressed differences in subjects' cue-use patterns were obtained, especially in forecasts for self.

An Assessment Of Addiction Researchers' Conceptions Of Addiction And Their Evaluation Of Brain-Based Explanations,2022,1,1,DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW,,,,,OCHTERBECK D and FORBERGER S,,,,,"Introduction brain-based explanations of addiction have become a prominent explanatory model in recent decades. Although opposing views have been published, there is no large-scale study of researchers' opinions, unlike for treatment staff, the public and affected individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to examine international addiction researchers' perspectives on: (i) brain-based explanations of addiction; (ii) the perceived dominance of the concept in science, society, treatment and among those affected; and (iii) researchers' general conception of addiction in terms of ontologies and causes. Methods a sample of 1440 international addiction researchers was compiled. Views were assessed online via limesurvey using a `mixed methods light' approach (likert-type scales, free-text fields). Qualitative content analyses of free-text comments complemented descriptive statistics. Results one hundred and ninety researchers participated (13.19\% response). The classification of substance use disorders as brain diseases/disorders was shared by about 60\% of the respondents. Approximately 80\% considered it the dominant view in science, but fewer in treatment, society and affected persons. Approximately 75\% found it an oversimplification, but regarded it as helpful for understanding substance use disorders. Altogether, various biological, psychological and social factors were considered causal. Comments indicated that an over-simplistic nature of brain-based explanations of addiction was viewed as particularly problematic. Discussion and conclusions a rejection of a simplistic view of addiction in favour of a multi-causal concept in which the brain plays a role seems to be the majority view of participating researchers. Therefore, the orientation of future research, treatment and support for addicted persons need to be reconsidered accordingly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,ADDICTION;BRAIN-BASED EXPLANATIONS OF ADDICTION;CAUSES OF ADDICTION;;RESEARCHERS' ATTITUDES;SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER;Brain,,

Brickman et al (see record [rid]1982-30315-001[/rid]). 31 inpatients and 30 outpatients attending a regional alcohol unit in england completed a questionnaire regarding attributions of res for causing and for solving the drinking problem. Ss' beliefs could not readily be understood in terms of a res model. With regard to the cause of ss' condition, belief in the role of luck, personal res, and acceptance of a disease model emerged as independent factors. With regard to res for recovery, belief in personal res, the value of treatment and support and the importance of motivation emerged as separate factors. Belief in personal res for causing the problem was significantly associated with acceptance of res for recovery. Treatment satisfaction was correlated with belief in the importance of treatment and support.

Attributional style, perceived self-worth, depressive symptoms, and externalizing behaviors were assessed in 371 students in the spring of 6th grade. After the transition to 7th grade, they again completed measures of depression and externalizing symptoms as well as measures of negative life events and school hassles. Stressors around the transition predicted both depressive and externalizing behaviors. Perceived self-worth predicted depressive symptoms, but not externalizing behaviors. Attributional style directly and in interaction with stressors predicted depressive symptoms and did not predict externalizing behavior. A 3-way interaction between stress, attributional style, and self-worth suggested that level of perceived self-worth may moderate the effects of attributional style in times of stress.

Design: from 1997 through 2000, a sample of 30 nonhospitalized women, self-identified as postpartum depressed was recruited by network and ``snowball sampling'' to discuss their beliefs about postpartum depression. With reference to the kleinman explanatory model of illness, their beliefs about postpartum depression and its treatment were contrasted to the biomedical model of postpartum depression. Methods: content analysis was done to classify data into cause, effect, severity, expectations, fears, and suggestions for treatment. Results were compared with dsm-iv diagnostic criteria. Results: postpartum depressed mothers' explanatory model of depression differed from the dsm-iv criteria for depression in that mothers' depiction was generally milder in form and consisted of sleep deprivation instead of sleep disorders. Also, mothers were confused, overwhelmed, and guilty about thoughts of hurting their babies. The mothers did not exhibit suicidal ideation. Mothers described the illness as severe and long lasting, causing multiple problems including marital discord. Implications: mothers suggested more public education and support for new mothers to prevent and treat the disorder.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,"POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION;EXPLANATORY MODEL;ASSESSMENT;TREATMENT;Postpartum Period;Depression, Postpartum",,

In an attempt to improve these outcomes, health care providers have developed targeted antenatal programmes that aim to address identified health behaviours that are known to contribute to poor health during pregnancy. While some areas of improvement have been noted in rates of engagement with health services, the rates of premature births and low birth weight babies continue to be significantly higher than in the non-aboriginal population. It appears that australian researchers have been focused on the behaviour of the individual and have failed to fully consider the impact that social and emotional well-being has on both health behaviours and pregnancy outcomes. This review has highlighted the need for an approach to both research and clinical practice that acknowledges the aboriginal view of health which encompasses mental, physical, cultural and spiritual health. Until clinicians and aboriginal women have a shared understanding of how social and emotional well-being is experienced by aboriginal women, in other words their explanatory model, it is unlikely that any meaningful improvements will be seen.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL;INDIGENOUS;STRESS;PREGNANCY;MENTAL HEALTH;Pregnancy;Oceanic Ancestry Group;Mental Health,,

Certain traits of positive schizotypy, such as odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences, suspiciousness, and referential thinking show associations with aberrant salience. Positive schizotypy may involve hyper-attribution of salience toward insignificant events, whereas negative schizotypy may involve hypo-attribution of salience, even toward important events. Attribution of salience is thought to involve dopamine-mediated processes, a mechanism that is disrupted in schizotypy; however, little is known about the cognitive processes potentially underlying salience attribution. The present study assessed the relationship between aberrant salience and latent inhibition (li), as well as their associations with positive and negative schizotypy. Salience was measured at various stages of processing, including visual salience, attributions of salience to contingency illusions, and self-reported experience of salience. Schizotypy traits were differentially associated with self-reported aberrant salience experiences: positive schizotypy showed positive associations (ß = 0.67, f² = 0.82, large effect) and negative schizotypy showed inverse associations (ß = -0.20, f² = 0.07, small effect). However, neither schizotypy dimension was associated with visual salience, contingency illusions, or li. Salience processing across perceptual, cognitive, and experiential levels likely involves different mechanisms, some of which may not show major disruption in subclinical manifestations of schizotypy.

Condition recognition and subsequent management of depression is variable and influenced by the attitudes and beliefs of clinicians as well as those of patients. Most studies examining health professionals' attitudes have been conducted in western nations; this study explores beliefs and attitudes about depression among doctors working in lahore, pakistan. Methods: a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2015 used a questionnaire concerning demographics, education in psychiatry, beliefs about depression causes, and attitudes about depression using the revised depression attitude questionnaire (r-daq). A convenience sample of 700 non-psychiatrist medical practitioners based in six hospitals in lahore was approached to participate in the survey. Results: six hundred and one (86 \%) of the doctors approached consented to participate; almost all respondents (99 \%) endorsed one of various biopsychosocial causes of depression (38 to 79 \% for particular causes), and 37 \% (between 13 and 19 \% for particular causes) noted that supernatural forces could be responsible. Supernatural causes were more commonly held by female doctors, those working in rural settings, and those with greater psychiatry specialist education. Attitudes to depression were mostly less confident or optimistic and less inclined to a generalist perspective than those of clinicians in the uk or european nations, and deterministic perspectives that depression is a natural part of aging or due to personal failings were particularly common. However, there was substantial confidence in the efficacy of antidepressants and psychological therapy. More confident and therapeutically optimistic views and a more generalist perspective about depression management were associated with a rejection of supernatural explanations of the origin of depression. Conclusions: non-psychiatrist medical practitioners in pakistan hold a range of views about the causes of depression, with supernatural explanations held by more than a third. Depression attitudes appear less positive than among uk and european clinicians, with the notions that depression is due to a lack of stamina and will-power and a natural part of growing old being especially commonly held; more positive attitudes appear to be associated with a rejection of supernatural explanatory models of depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Questionnaires;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,

Since epidemiological distribution patterns consistently deviating from expected values provide valuable indications of causal relationships, we chose the higher age of females at first admission for schizophrenia, first reported by kraepelin and since then confirmed in over 50 studies, as the basis for our study. This unexplained epidemiological finding was replicated on danish and mannheim case-register data by systematically controlling for selection and diagnostic artefacts and by testing alternative explanations at the individual stage of the study. To check whether the difference in age at first admission was determined by a difference in age at onset, a representative sample of 267 first-admitted patients with non-affective functional psychosis was examined by using an interview for the retrospective assessment of the onset of schizophrenia (iraos) designed for this purpose. Any of the definitions of first-ever onset applied - first sign of mental disorder, first psychotic symptom, first acute episode - led to a significant age difference of 3.2 to 4.1 years between the sexes. The distribution of onsets across the life cycle showed a later increase and a second, lower peak between the ages of 45 and 54 years among females compared with males. The lifetime risk for schizophrenia was equal for males and females. After testing the plausibility of psychosocial versus biological explanations we hypothesized that due to the effect of oestrogens the vulnerability threshold for schizophrenia is elevated in females until the menopause. Animal experiments and post mortem analyses showed that chronic oestrogen applications significantly shortened dopamine-induced behaviour and reduced d2 receptor sensitivity in the brain. The applicability of this pathophysiological mechanism to human schizophrenia was tested on acutely schizophrenic females with normal menstrual cycles. A significant negative correlation was found between measures of symptomatology and plasma oestrogen levels. The manifestation of symptoms in schizophrenia appears to be influenced by a sufficiently sensitive d2 receptor system in the brain, blocked by neuroleptics and modulated by oestrogens.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Schizophrenia;Causality,,

It occurs in normals as well during intense emotional states and heavy labor or exercise. In clinical cases, it generally causes severe suffering. Dyspnea has multifactorial causes and the explanation for the symptom may differ largely among patients. Explanatory models imply the involvement of mechanisms at several levels of functioning, such as afferent signals from the respiratory muscles or blood gas levels related to hypercapnia and hypoxia. Depending on the relative involvement of specific mechanisms and their interactions, dyspnea may be experienced differently and subtypes can be distinguished. More recently, perceptual-cognitive and emotional processes related to symptom perception and interpretation have been investigated in the context of dyspnea. In this review, we focus on the psychological processes that play part in the perception of dyspnea and formulate some practical guidelines for those who are confronted with dyspnea.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,DYSPNEA/*PSYCHOLOGY;SOMATOFORM DISORDERS/*PSYCHOLOGY;AROUSAL/PHYSIOLOGY;AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM/PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;AWARENESS/PHYSIOLOGY;BRAIN/PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;DYSPNEA/PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;EMOTIONS/PHYSIOLOGY;HUMANS;NEURAL PATHWAYS/PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;SICK ROLE;SOMATOFORM DISORDERS/DIAGNOSIS;SOMATOFORM DISORDERS/PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;SOMATOSENSORY DISORDERS/DIAGNOSIS;SOMATOSENSORY DISORDERS/PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;SOMATOSENSORY DISORDERS/PSYCHOLOGY;SPINAL CORD/PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;Dyspnea,,

Ss then completed several measures, including an abbreviated version of the counselor rating form. The counterdefensive trainee was judged to be somewhat more socially skilled than the defensive trainee, but the defensive trainee was rated as significantly more self-confident. Regardless of the trainee's explanation, however, when the client's depression lifted, the trainee was viewed as significantly more competent, self-confident, expert, and attractive than she was when the client's depression worsened.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 parents recruited from a list of children who had been diagnosed with adhd at a community-based child development center (cdc) in goa, india. The most frequent reasons for consulting the cdc were educational difficulties. Despite having received an adhd diagnosis and reporting significant adverse impact of the child's behavior, most parents were reluctant to accept the biomedical explanatory model or even consider their child's difficulties as an illness. Instead, parents most commonly attributed causality to psychological models, learning and memory difficulties, and to models which emphasized either the volitional or non-volitional nature of the problem, or to attribute blame of self or spouse. Interventions most commonly used were educational and religious; consultation with the cdc was the last resort for many parents. We conclude that cultural attitudes towards mental illness significantly affect parental perception and behavior in response to interventions by biomedical practitioners for child mental health problems in developing countries.

This study explores whether the perception of course of illness of people with symptoms indicating schizophrenia is associated with the desire for social distance in the vietnamese public. A population-based survey (n = 455) using unlabelled vignettes for schizophrenia was carried out in the hanoi municipality in 2013. First, a factor analysis was performed to group items indicating perception of prognosis. Second, a linear regression analysis was used to search for correlations between these expectations and desire for social distance. The factor analysis revealed three independent factors of perception of course of illness: (1) loss of social integration and functioning, (2) lifelong dependency on others, and (3) positive expectations towards treatment outcome. Both factors with negative prognostic perceptions (1\&2) were associated with more desire for social distance. The results indicate a link between social acceptance and the perceived ability to maintain a social role including a capability of reciprocity within the vietnamese society. Additionally, these findings highlight the importance of preserving social functioning in any treatment approach for patients with schizophrenia, which includes psychosocial intervention and rehabilitation programs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Schizophrenia;Social Desirability;Vietnam,,

Increasing public dissemination of information regarding the role of genetics in obesity could have beneficial, harmful, or neutral effects on the stigmatization of obese individuals. This study used an online survey and experimental design to examine the impact of genetic versus non-genetic information on obesity stigma among self-perceived non-overweight individuals. Participants (n = 396) were randomly assigned to read either genetic, non-genetic (environment), or gene-environment interaction obesity causal information. A total of 48% of participants were female; mean age was 42.7 years (range = 18-86 years); 75% were white; 45.2% had an annual household income of less than $40,000; mean bmi was 23.4 kg/m². Obesity stigma was measured using the fat phobia scaleshort form (fps-s). After reading the experimental information, participants in the genetic and gene-environment conditions were more likely to believe that genetics increase obesity risk than participants in the non-genetic condition (both p < 0.05), but did not differ on obesity stigma. Obesity stigma was higher among whites and asians than hispanics and african americans (p = 0.029), and associated with low self-esteem (p = 0.036). Obesity stigma was also negatively associated with holding 'germ or virus' (p = 0.033) and 'overwork' (p = 0.016) causal beliefs about obesity, and positively associated with 'diet or eating habits' (p = 0.001) and 'lack of exercise' (p = 0.004) causal beliefs. Dissemination of brief information about the role of genetics in obesity may have neither a beneficial nor a harmful impact on obesity stigmatization compared with non-genetic information among self-perceived non-overweight individuals.

Bitemporal ect (bt, stimulating electrodes placed bilaterally in the frontotemporal region) is the form of ect with relatively potent clinical and cognitive side effects. However, the reasons for this are poorly understood.; Objective: this study used computational modelling to examine regional differences in brain excitation between bt, bifrontal (bf) and right unilateral (rul) ect, currently the most clinically-used ect placements. Specifically, by comparing similarities and differences in current distribution patterns between bt ect and the other two placements, the study aimed to create an explanatory model of critical brain sites that mediate antidepressant efficacy and sites associated with cognitive, particularly memory, adverse effects.; Methods: high resolution finite element human head models were generated from mri scans of three subjects. The models were used to compare differences in activation between the three ect placements, using subtraction maps.; Results and conclusion: in this exploratory study on three realistic head models, bitemporal ect resulted in greater direct stimulation of deep midline structures and also left temporal and inferior frontal regions. Interpreted in light of existing knowledge on depressive pathophysiology and cognitive neuroanatomy, it is suggested that the former sites are related to efficacy and the latter to cognitive deficits. We hereby propose an approach using binarised subtraction models that can be used to optimise, and even individualise, ect therapies. (Copyright © 2016 elsevier masson sas.

Methods: data were taken from an epidemiological survey conducted during 2003-2004 with a national clustered sample of australian adults aged 18 years and over. Following the presentation of a vignette describing depression (n = 1001) or schizophrenia (n = 997), respondents were asked a series of questions relating to their knowledge and recognition of the disorder, beliefs about the helpfulness of treating professionals and medical, psychological and lifestyle treatments, and likely causes. Results: participant age was coded into five categories and cross-tabulated with mental health literacy variables. Comparisons between age groups revealed that although older adults (70+ years) were poorer than younger age groups at correctly recognising depression and schizophrenia, young adults (18-24 years) were more likely to misidentify schizophrenia as depression. Differences were also observed between younger and older age groups in terms of beliefs about the helpfulness of certain treating professionals and medical and lifestyle treatments for depression and schizophrenia, and older respondents were more likely to believe that schizophrenia could be caused by character weakness. Conclusion: differences in mental health literacy across the adult lifespan suggest that more specific, age appropriate messages about mental health are required for younger and older age groups. The tendency for young adults to `over-identify' depression signals the need for awareness campaigns to focus on differentiation between mental disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA,,

All case reports were associated with use rather than withdrawal of herbalmedicines. Only one case report was rated for probability of association using a standardized algorithm. Laboratory assays to confirm composition of the herbal preparation were reported in only one article describing two cases and indicating admixture of a likely causal pharmaceutical in the herbal preparation. Conclusions: causal attributions are problematic given the limited number of reports, antidepressant co-prescribing in 7 cases, insufficient data regarding pattern and type of herbal medicine use, and lack of a reference frequency for spontaneous mania. The quality assessment scores across the 26 papers (35 case reports) were as follows: low quality (0), lower-medium quality (9), upper-medium quality (10) and high quality (7). Putative pathophysiological mechanisms were postulated for nine of the 11 herbal medicines and centered on hpa-axis activation and increased monoamine activity. Systematic study of the association between herbal medicines and the course of bipolar disorder may contribute to defining targets for pathophysiological research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,HERBAL MEDICINE;CASE REPORT;BIPOLAR DISORDER;MANIA;PHYTOTHERAPY;Bipolar Disorder;Cannabis,,
rayyan-470329765,Twentieth-Century Theories On Combat Motivation And Breakdown,2006,1,1,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY,,,,,WESSELY S,,,,,"All the combatant nations of the first world war struggled to deal with the problem of large-scale casualties that could not be ascribed to simple physical injury. After a brief flirtation with medical explanations ('shell-shock') these were soon realized to be psychological in nature, but not until the end of the war was there much consensus on whether these represented a psychological response to the stressors of industrial warfare, or alternatively a failure of motivation or even masculinity. Simultaneously combat motivation was seen within a moral framework that emphasized duty, patriotism, leadership and character. It was these latter virtues, or lack of them, that gradually came to explain combat breakdown, and not the psychological theories, even if modern narratives tend to overlook this. If a person had sufficient character, leadership and training, breakdown was unlikely even under the harshest conditions. By the end of the second world war, new thinking and research, mainly from the american forces, now downplayed the importance of ideological and personal factors, and instead concluded that the most powerful motivation for combat (as opposed to enlistment) came from the role of the small group-'men fight for their buddies'. Breakdown was still seen as the reserve side of combat motivation, most likely when the small group disintegrated, although ultimately even the most robust could succumb after prolonged combat exposure. However, provided that the individual was previously of normal personality, this would be short lived. Long-term illness was still almost entirely attributed to vulnerabilities acquired by inheritance or during childhood. Combat breakdown could also be made chronic by the influence of secondary gain, and so medical labels for combat breakdown were avoided, treatment was by reassurance and return to duty, and compensation was discouraged where possible. It was not until the aftermath of the vietnam war that views on combat motivation and breakdown began to diverge. As a result of the efforts of american psychiatrists opposed to the vietnam war a new medical label, post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), was introduced in 1980. It was now believed that not just transient, but also chronic, mental disorders could be caused by combat, even in those previously of robust disposition, and that the necessity for a diagnosis and compensation overcame concerns about illness reinforcement and secondary gain. Social explanations for breakdown based on group psychology largely disappeared, to be replaced by a framework based almost entirely on individual responses to trauma, although the role of predisposition quickly needed to be rediscovered. In contrast, the military continue to insist on the importance of small group psychology in explaining motivation to fight, and are distrustful of either ideological or individual explanatory models.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Motivation,,

The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of depression in explaining the functional status of community-dwelling older adults and to explore the utility of a short version 5-item geriatric depression scale (gds-5) as a screening tool. Design: cross-sectional survey settings: six hospitals and communities served by home-delivery meal programs participants: 529 individuals aged 60 years and older. Measurements: using structured survey questionnaires, key variables including demographics, depression status, and two domains of functional status assessed by basic activities of daily living (adl) / instrumental adl (iadl) and mini-mental status (mmse) were collected. To determine the unique contribution of depression in explaining functional status of participating older adults, hierarchical multiple regression was conducted. Results: the model explained 18 \% of the total variance in physical function and 21 \% of the total variance in cognitive function. Race/ethnicity and depression were significant predictors of functional status. In particular, entry of the depression variable resulted in a significant r square change of 7\%, accounting for a unique portion of the adl/iadl variance. In terms of cognitive function measured by mmse, entry of the depression variable showed a small, but significant change. Older adults who were ethnic minorities and had depression were significantly more likely to report poor perceived physical and cognitive function. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that some personal factors such as age, education, race/ethnicity contributed to the explanatory model, and depressive symptoms significantly explained additional variance. Gds-5 was less reliable (cronbach's alpha= 0.5) to assess depressive symptoms in this study. Conclusion: depression was a significant contributing factor to functional limitations of older adults. A short 5-item version of the gds could be used to screen older adults, but two-tiered gds-5/15 would be better alternative tool.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,DEPRESSION;FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION;OLDER ADULTS;GERIATRIC DEPRESSION;SCALE (GDS-5);Geriatrics,,

While they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging, 20 participants read short sentences about another person ('someone') who engaged in behaviors with the participant or made comments about the participant. The participants then attributed these behaviors to three attribution loci: themselves, the other person or the situation. The results revealed common activation across the three attribution loci in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (tpj), left posterior superior temporal sulcus, precuneus and right temporal pole (tp). Comparisons between the attribution loci revealed very little differences, except for increased activation of the right tp while making attributions to the situation compared with the self. In addition, when making attributions to the situation or other persons for negative events, there were reliable correlations between low activity in the left tpj and high levels of anxiety and problematic social interaction in autism. The results indicate that attributions to different loci are based on the same underlying brain process, which might be atypical among persons with anxiety or autism symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION;FMRI;PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;AUTISM;ANXIETY,,

However, the detection of behaviors as symptoms of psychopathologies requiring clinical diagnosis and treatment remains low. In order to advance understanding of psychological phenomena and particularly their behavioral manifestations, new theoretical and methodological perspectives such as network analysis are applied. Method: in the present study, we explore the dynamics of the symptoms of different internalizing, externalizing, and personal-contextual problems using network analysis. We estimate networks of regularized partial correlations, including measures of standard centrality, and the global and structural impact of symptoms on each network. Results: the results show that the syndromes we studied are activated through dynamics of symptoms that are strongly related to each other and act as intermediaries of potential psychopathological problems in children and adolescents (e.g., ``feels sad,'' ``worries,'' ``won't talk,'' ``nausea,'' ``threatens others,'' ``steals outside''). Centrality measures and impact coefficient ranges were strength (-2.39, 2.05), betweenness (-1.43, 3.38), closeness (-2.60, 2.23), and expected influence (-2.87, 2.13).

The concept of 'mental health literacy' is defined as the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes related to the recognition, management, and prevention of psychiatric disorders. We aimed to investigate mental health literacy concerning different obsessive-compulsive symptoms in a community sample. Methods: the sample consisted of 376 healthy subjects. They were given vignettes describing four cases with different symptom categories of obsessive-compulsive disorders (aggressive obsessions and related compulsions, contamination obsessions and related compulsions, religious obsessions and related compulsions, and ordering-arranging-counting obsessions and related compulsions), based on factor analytic studies. Each vignette was followed by 17 questions about problem recognition, causes, care alternatives and stigma-shame. Results: when comparing the different categories, the participants were significantly more likely to rate the aggressive category as an abnormal condition and to associate it with stressful life events; to rate the aggressive and contamination categories as signs of mental disorder and to associate them with medical causes; and to rate religious category as a religious problem, and seeing a religious healer was the preferred care-seeking behavior. Significantly more participants noted that they would hide aggressive and religious category symptoms from their family members and co-workers, and would feel shame. Participants were more likely to hold stigmatizing attitudes towards persons with symptoms of contamination category. Conclusion: these findings suggest that the presence of different phenomenological characteristics of ocd may influence health care-seeking behavior in complex ways, due to mental health literacy. While social environment provides a bearable, acceptable or suitable atmosphere for a number of psychiatric problems, some problems might be less tolerated in the sociocultural context.

After the moral panic of the 1960s shut down psychedelic research, however, these two phenomena became disentangled. In the decades following, the science of psychosis transformed, shedding the language of psychoanalysis, and adopting the new scientific veneer of psychiatry. Today, as psychedelic science re-emerges, the research programs surrounding psychosis and psychedelics now stand in stark contrast. Here, i look closely at how these research programs respond to questions related to what is worth measuring, what is worth investigating, and how we ought to respond to these experiences. This comparison reveals radically different assumptions and values that guide each research paradigm and shape clinical practice. While psychedelic research often includes scales that seek to capture experiences of mysticism, meaningfulness, and ego dissolution, research related to psychosis focuses on the measurement of pathological symptoms and functioning. Research into psychosis primarily seeks universal and reductionist causal explanations and interventions, while psychedelic research embraces the importance of set and setting in shaping unique experiences. Responses to psychedelic crisis involve warmth, compassion, and support, while responses to psychotic experiences often involve restraint, seclusion, and weapons. I argue that these differences contain important lessons for psychiatry. However, as psychedelic research struggles to meet regulatory requirements and fit within the paradigm of evidence-based medicine, these differences may quickly dissolve.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,CRISIS RESPONSE;OUTCOME MEASURES;PSYCHEDELICS;PSYCHOSIS;SET AND;SETTING;Hallucinogens;Psychotic Disorders,,

To date, no studies have directly compared these beliefs between people with and without bd. Based on the srm, the current research examined beliefs about mood in people with and without bd and explored the impact of current affect on these beliefs. Fifty euthymic people with a diagnosis of bd and 50 controls were recruited through an online screening study, clinical services, and support organizations. Experience sampling methodology (esm) was used to assess beliefs (according to the brief illness perceptions questionnaire; broadbent, petrie, main, \& weinman, 2006) across a typical week of everyday life. Data were analysed using multilevel modelling. Forty-two people with a diagnosis of bd and 50 controls were included in the analyses. Results indicated that the bd group reported less control over mood, a shorter duration of mood, and less understanding of mood and were more likely to report the cause of depressive symptoms as something internal, compared with controls. When controlling for current affect, the bd group also reported more positive consequences, made more internal attributions for hypomanic symptoms, and reported less concern about mood, compared with controls. Findings suggest important differences in beliefs about mood between people with and without bd that are not the result of current affect. These beliefs may be particularly important in understanding underlying vulnerability to future relapse into depression and/or mania.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,AFFECT;BELIEFS;BIPOLAR;EXPERIENCE SAMPLING;MOOD;Bipolar Disorder,,

Respondents completed questionnaires in their homes with the assistance of an interviewer. Results suggested that support for policy interventions was greatest when responsibility was attributed to factors beyond individual control, with support for child-focused interventions particularly high. The relationship is more complex than previous studies suggest, as believing in the over-availability of unhealthy foods predicted higher support for policy interventions, whereas beliefs in structural explanations, such as cost, had little influence on support. Recognition of this complexity may help to design more effective future policies to tackle obesity.

We set up a field study in which students from the first form of secondary education were asked to report their causal attributions of regular school examinations in three school subjects: history, native language, and mathematics. The results suggest that students generate different causal attributions for successful or unsuccessful examinations, belonging to different school-subjects.

Individuals diagnosed with it often describe feelings of trauma and social rejection due to cosmetic repercussions and are at high risk of experiencing psychological distress. Physical activity (pa) participation has been associated with better mental health outcomes in diverse populations. A preliminary study of individuals with aa indicated that severe hair loss is associated with symptomatic depression, anxiety and stress, which negatively impacted pa participation. While strategies to increase pa participation in the general population have been established, little is known about pa participation in people with aa. This study aimed to understand barriers and enablers to pa participation in people with aa to inform the development of evidence-based interventions. Methods: the study used a grounded theory (gt) methodology, relying on an iterative and simultaneous process of data collection, coding, theory development, and data comparisons to explore the perceived barriers and enablers to pa. Data were collected through a focus group (8 participants [33.38 +/- 10.81 years]) and individual telephone interviews (8 participants [33.89 +/- 11.87 years]). The study was conducted in melbourne, australia. Interview data were recorded digitally, transcribed verbatim and analysed. Recruitment continued until theoretical saturation was achieved. Results: the constructivist grounded theory method used has assisted to develop an explanatory model which is used to explain the themes for barriers and enablers to pa participation. The four phases in the explanatory model are as follows (1) onset of aa; (2) reaction towards the condition; (3) adjustment; and (4) acceptance. Conclusion: the findings highlighted perceived barriers and enablers to pa participation in people with aa. Future interventions could consider addressing these barriers specifically to maximise effectiveness and to improve mental health status based on the phases of the explanatory model.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,PHYSICAL ACTIVITY;ALOPECIA AREATA;BODY IMAGE;MENTAL HEALTH;ANXIETY;;DEPRESSION;STRESS;CONSTRUCTIVIST GROUNDED THEORY;ADJUSTMENT AND;ACCEPTANCE;Motor Activity;Alopecia,,

Contextualizing The Symptoms Of Mental Health,2019,1,1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MIGRATION HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE,,,,,RYAN J and GUERIN PBT and ELMI FH and GUERIN B,,,,,"Purpose the purpose of this paper is to review all the research on somali refugee communities' ``explanatory models'' of ``mental health'' or psychological suffering, and also report original research in order to allow for more contexts on their ``mental health'' terms to emerge. Design/methodology/approach the authors talked in a conversational manner with a small number (11) of somali people (10 females and 1 male), but this was done intensively over time and on multiple occasions. They discussed their community terms for ``mental health'' issues but in their own contexts and with their own examples. Findings the results showed that somali as a community had three main groupings of symptoms: jinn or spirit possession; waali or ``craziness''; and a group of terms for serious anxieties, rumination, worrying and thinking too much. What was new from their broader descriptions of context was that the community discourses were based on particular contexts of the person and their behavior within their life history, rather than aiming to universal categories like the dsm. Practical implications - both research and practice on mental health should focus less on universal diagnoses and more on describing the contexts in which the symptoms emerge and how to change those contexts, especially with refugee and other less well-understood groups. Originality/value the review and original results support symptom-based or contextual approaches to mental health; we should treat the ``mental health'' symptoms in their life contexts rather than as a disease or disorder. We can learn from how somali describe their ``mental health'' symptoms rather than treat their descriptions as crude forms of the ``correct'' western diagnostics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,MENTAL HEALTH;COMMUNITY DISCOURSES;Mental Health,,

In this article, we review studies of the psychological mechanisms that might be involved in paranoid thinking and discuss their implications for forensic behaviour science. Paranoia has not been consistently associated with any specific neuropsychological abnormality. However, evidence supports three broad types of mechanism that might be involved in delusional thinking in general and paranoia in particular: anomalous perceptual experiences, abnormal reasoning, and motivational factors. There is some evidence that paranoia may be associated with hearing loss, and good evidence that paranoid patients attend excessively to threatening information. Although general reasoning ability seems to be unaffected, there is strong evidence that a jumping-to-conclusions style of reasoning about data is implicated in delusions in general, but less consistent evidence specifically linking paranoia to impaired theory of mind. Finally, there appears to be a strong association between paranoia and negative self-esteem, and some evidence that attempts to protect self-esteem by attributing negative events to external causes are implicated. Some of these processes have recently been implicated in violent behaviour, and they therefore have the potential to explain the apparent association between paranoid delusions and offending.

Eysenck's (1967) theoretical perspective on the development of anxiety to explain audience perceptions of public speakers. Specifically, the effects of social conditioning, particularly punishment, and the relative conditionability of an individual's nervous system combine to predict behavioral responses to state anxiety. Ss were 103 students enrolled in an introductory college speech course. 33 served as speakers. Speaker anxiety behaviors were observed by 40 ss divided into 4 rating teams of 10 each. Additionally, 30 ss divided into 3 teams of 10 rated audience-perceived public speaking state anxiety. Speakers presented 5-min speeches under normal classroom conditions, were videotaped, and speaker anxiety behaviors and audience-observed speaker anxiety were assessed by the teams of raters. The hypothesis that behavioral rigidity and inhibition are significant, additive predictors of audience perceived speaker state anxiety was confirmed. The authors discuss these findings in light of treatment strategies, such as flooding and systematic desensitization, designed to counteract behavioral inhibition.

The self-medication hypothesis (i.e., alcohol use is negatively reinforced via the alleviation of negative affect) has dominated explanatory models of comorbidity. However, self-regulation has also demonstrated cross-sectional relationships with both depression and alcohol problems and may contribute to the development of alternative comorbidity models. Self-regulation introduces three alternative models that can be tested empirically: (a) a depressed regulation model, (b) a central nervous system depressant model, and (c) a self-regulatory failure model. The purpose of this study was to test the utility of these models (in addition to the self-medication hypothesis) by examining the temporal precedence in the relations between self-regulation, depressive symptoms, and alcohol problems among heavy-drinking college students (n = 393) over 5 assessment points (baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 16 months) using an autoregressive cross-lagged model. Lower self-regulation, and higher alcohol problems and depressive symptoms, prospectively predicted higher depressive symptoms. Higher alcohol problems and lower self-regulation prospectively predicted higher alcohol problems. Only self-regulation prospectively predicted self-regulation. These results were consistent across multiple time points. Findings are consistent with a self-regulatory failure model of depressive symptoms and alcohol problems. Therefore, self-regulation may be an important etiological variable and potential intervention target to reduce both alcohol problems and depressive symptoms among college students.

Methods: adopting a cluster convenience sampling method, the study recruited 200 chinese-speaking subjects from four major areas in metropolitan melbourne where many chinese live. The respondents were presented with a vignette describing an individual with depression and then asked questions to assess their understanding of depression and preference for professional help, medications and treatment methods. A comparative approach was used to compare the findings with those of a previous study of the mental health literacy of australian and japanese adults. Results: compared to the australian and japanese samples, a much lower percentage of chinese-speaking australians (14\%) could correctly identify major depression described in the vignette, and a higher percentage believed that counseling professionals could be helpful. Higher percentages of those who believed that close family members could be helpful were found in the chinese-speaking australian and japanese samples, and these two groups also expressed more uncertainty about the usefulness or harmfulness of certain medications compared to the australian sample. Higher percentages of respondents in both the chinese-speaking australian and the australian sample considered ``lifestyle changes'' to be helpful compared to the japanese sample. In the chinese-speaking sample, 30\%, 17.4\%, 33\% and 27\% of the respondents rated ``traditional chinese medicine doctors,'' `` chinese herbal medications,'' `` taking chinese nutritional foods/supplements'' and ``qiqong'' as helpful. Many perceived ``changing fungshui'' and ``traditional chinese worship'' to be harmful. Regarding the perception of causes of mental illness, items related to psychosocial perspectives including ``life stress'' and ``interpersonal conflict'' were rated highly by the respondents, whereas traditional beliefs including `` punishment for misdeeds conducted by ancestors'' and ``demon possession'' had the lowest ratings. Conclusions: campaigns to increase the mental health literacy of chinese-speaking australians are needed.

We asked whether this effect is attenuated in the context of a structured diagnostic clinical interview procedure, which deliberately directs evaluators' attention to symptoms alone, or whether it is robust enough to continue to emerge. Across two experiments, lay evaluators given causal life-event explanations for disordered behaviors gave them lower judgments of abnormality and need for treatment compared to evaluators not given such explanations, regardless of whether they used a structured clinical interview. Thus, causal life-event explanations may have significant impact on clinical evaluations regardless of the mode of assessment.

Although the theoretical part of framework anal ysis has been well documented, there is limited literature describing its practical use. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate systematic and explicit guidance in using framework analysis by giving an example of a study exploring women's experience of postnatal depression. Method: data presented in this paper comes from semi-structured interviews of 33 women (from three different cultural backgrounds) attending for a child or postnatal care in six purposively selected maternal and child health (mch) clinics in kuala lumpur. Results: data were analyzed using framework analysis, which consists of three interrelated stages. In the first stage (data management), a careful selection of the data (transcripts) to be reviewed was made. The initial categories were developed based on the selected transcripts, and the initial themes were decided (known as a thematic framework). In the second stage (descriptive accounts), the thematic framework was investigated to identify any linkage and similarity between one category to another. The third stage of the analysis (explanatory accounts) involved checking exactly how the level of matching between the phenomena was distributed across the whole set of data. Using framework analysis, four themes were identified to explain the women's experience of postnatal depression namely the changes, causal explanations, dealing with postnatal depression, and perceived impacts. Conclusions: the details of each stage of the analysis were explained to guide researchers through essential steps in undertaking framework analysis.

In the past three decades, considerable efforts have been directed towards understanding the neurocognitive atypicalities that underlie these core behaviours. This chapter provides an overview of the major theoretical accounts of autism, especially the theory of mind hypothesis, the executive dysfunction hypothesis, and weak central coherence theory, each of which has aimed to explain autism in terms of a single underlying cognitive atypicality. Some of the reasons why researchers have become dissatisfied with these so-called 'single-deficit' accounts as explanatory models of autism will be analysed, before turning to more recent 'multiple-deficits' models to begin the task of outlining the additional challenges faced by such models. The chapter concludes by stressing the need to situate explanatory accounts of autismsingle or multiple-deficit modelswithin a developmental context.

Seventy-one chemotherapy-naive subjects participated in the study. Patients were assessed the day before chemotherapy with measurements of their anxiety level, depression, fatigue and proneness to nv, motion sickness, nv experienced in past pregnancies. History of labyrinthitis, expectation of developing nv and expectation of developing pain. Patients also completed daily assessments of frequency, duration and intensity of nv for the 7 days after chemotherapy. Regression analyses revealed that non-pharmacological factors explained part of the variance of nv, the most common predictors being a history of labyrinthitis, expectation of developing nv after chemotherapy, younger age, stage of disease, and state anxiety. The explanatory power of the models ranged from 6\% to 23\% of the variance of the independent variable. There were different explanatory models for acute and delayed nv. Results indicate that consideration of the role of nonpharmacological factors in the development of nv could lead to more effective management of nv induced by chemotherapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NONPHARMACOLOGICAL FACTORS;NAUSEA;VOMITING;CHEMOTHERAPY;Breast Neoplasms,,

It addresses the questions as to when and why people approach psychiatrists and religious healers by arguing that approaches assessing 'explanatory models' and other knowledge structures relevant to the people's health-seeking behaviour should place more emphasis on the people's strong desire to get well, in any way possible. Secondly, the difference between beliefs rooted in the patients life-worlds and explanations suggested to them by experts has to be acknowledged. These insights motivate a shift away from the concept 'religion' towards the differentiation between pragmatic and scholastic religiosities. This argument relates back to the greek meaning of 'pragma' understood by hans-georg gadamer as 'that within which we are entangled in the praxis of living'.

Prototypically, a single electrical stimulus is directed to a peripheral nerve in advance of transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) delivered to the contralateral primary motor cortex (m1). Repeated pairing of the stimuli (i.e., association) over an extended period may in crease or decrease the excitability of corticospinal projections from m1, in manner that depends on the interstimulus interval (isi). It has been suggested that these effects represent a form of associative long-term potentiation (ltp) and depression (ltd) that bears resemblance to spike-timing dependent plasticity (stdp) as it has been elaborated in animal models. With a large body of empirical evidence having emerged since the cardinal features of pas were first described, and in light of the variations from the original protocols that have been implemented, it is opportune to consider whether the phenomenology of pas remains consistent with the characteristic features that were initially disclosed. This assessment necessarily has bearing upon interpretation of the effects of pas in relation to the specific cellular pathways that are putatively engaged, including those that adhere to the rules of stdp. The balance of evidence suggests that the mechanisms that contribute to the ltp and ltd-type responses to pas differ depending on the precise nature of the induction protocol that is used. In addition to emphasizing the requirement for additional explanatory models, in the present analysis we highlight the key features of the pas phenomenology that require interpretation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,LONG-TERM POTENTIATION;LONG-TERM DEPRESSION;TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC;STIMULATION;PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATION;HUMAN;CORTEX;SPIKE-TIMING;DEPENDENT PLASTICITY;TRANSLATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

In contrast, the illness perception approach, the topic of this editorial, begins with the patient's experience of their illness and the main emphasis is on the patient's own model of their condition. Just as people construct representations of the external world to explain and predict events, patients develop similar cognitive models of the bodily changes that reflect either transient symptoms or more long-term illness. The authors believe that this approach has a widespread application in psychosomatic medicine, because all patients will construct working representations of their illness, and is therefore not limited to those who are regarded as having a pathological response to their condition.

In a first pilot study, subjects described actual emotion-evoking incidents. The results indicated that these free descriptions included preattributional variables more often (43 per cent) than attributional appraisals (13 per cent), and that the hypothesized preattributional cues were used to describe the emotions. In a second experimental study, preattributional or attributional information about an event was presented, and subjects were asked to judge an actor's emotions or expectations. The time needed to make this judgment was recorded judgments and response times were not significantly different after preattributional or attributional information, but were different for distinct emotions and expectations in accordance with the hypotheses. The data were interpreted as suggesting that people possess cognitive schemas about the preattributional and attributional determinants of emotions, and that these schemas speed up the processing of diagnostic inputs that shape emotions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Emotions,,

Social cognition has recently been found to be a stronger predictor of functioning than neurocognition. This study is the first to investigate if externalizing attributional biases that are typically associated with psychosis play a role in the vocational pathways of people with early psychosis. Methods: a cross-sectional design was used. Fifty participants with early psychosis were recruited from a cohort of 144 participants of the lambeth early onset randomized control trial at 18-month follow-up. Information on occupational functioning was obtained using case notes and interview. Severity of symptoms was assessed and participants completed measures on attributional style and executive functioning. Results: although executive functioning and positive symptoms were associated with poor occupational functioning, an externalizing attributional style for failures and reduced engagement in occupational activities during the previous 18 months emerged as the only predictors of poor occupational functioning at 18-month follow-up. Conclusions: an externalizing attributional bias is associated with poor occupational functioning. Further research is needed to investigate the direction of this relationship and whether attributional biases mediate the impact of symptoms and cognitive impairment on functioning.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression or anxiety influence patients' attributions about the causes of their heart disease. The primary hypothesis was that depressed or anxious patients are more likely to endorse negative emotions as among the causes of their heart disease than are patients who are not depressed or anxious. Sixty-nine patients with documented ischemic heart disease recruited from an exercise stress testing laboratory completed the beck depression and anxiety inventories and a heart disease attribution checklist. Univariate analyses confirmed that patients who are depressed or anxious are more likely than other patients to endorse negative emotions as causes of their heart disease.

This study explores how patients with schizophrenia came to the conclusion that they were possessed, and how this affected help-seeking. Interviews with two men and two women about their experiences and meaning-making were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. Three main themes were identified: (1) links between traumatic experiences and psychotic symptoms, (2) the emergence of religious themes in delusional contents, and (3) reluctance to use medical treatment and instead to seek exorcism. In each case, attributing problems to possession was supported by the local environment and media, led to seeking spiritual help, and delayed diagnostic assessment and treatment. However, using religious coping contributed to the sense of predictability and social support.

Based on a critical analysis of these accounts, we will present our own account according to which mental disorders are dispositional properties that are token-identical to physical properties. More specifically, they are analyzed as dispositions to cause the specific set of symptoms. We argue that our account is not only able to account for multiple realizability without running into the causal exclusion problem, but that it also allows for the integration of very different factors into the description and explanation of mental disorders, such as neurological and neurochemical factors on the one side and social and cultural factors on the other.

Common mental disorder (cmd) is highly prevalent among low-income immigrant women, yet few receive effective treatment. This underutilization is partly owing to a lack of conceptual synchrony between biopsychiatric theories underlying conventional mental treatments and explanatory models in community settings. The action to improve self-esteem and health through asset building (asha) program is a depression intervention designed by and for south asian women immigrants. Asha helps women to build psychological, social, and financial assets. Objectives. This paper describes the development and a preliminary pilot evaluation of the asha intervention. Methods. Researchers, clinicians, activists, and women from the bronx bangladeshi community collaboratively designed a depression intervention that would synchronize with local concepts of distress. In addition to providing mental health treatment, asha addresses social isolation and financial dependence. Asha was evaluated in a pilot study described in this paper. Participants were assigned to intervention or delayed intervention (control) groups. Data collection at baseline and time 2 (6 months) included the patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9) and an indigenous measure of psychological and somatic distress. Results. Eighty percent of intervention participants completed the 6-month program. After treatment, mean phq-9 scores in the intervention group decreased from 9.90 to 4.26 (p < .001). Participants saved an average of \$10 per week. To date, participants have applied their skills and savings toward such activities as starting small businesses and enrolling in community college. Conclusions. Asha was effective in improving depression and increasing financial independence. Using a culturally syn-chronous approach to psychological treatment may be effective in ameliorating distress in immigrant populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Ian""=>""Included""}",,COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH;COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS;;HEALTH DISPARITIES;HEALTH SERVICES;INDIGENOUS;MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES;Emigrants and Immigrants,,

Twenty staff members were assessed for expressed emotion (ee) using the camberwell family interview (cfi) in regard to a client for whom they were a designated key worker. Their spontaneous attributions for the patient's problems were also assessed, along with self-report staff and patient ratings of their expressed and perceived feelings and thoughts about their staff or patient counterpart. The study found that although none of the staff were rated as fulfilling criteria for high ee, there was evidence of some variability in the quality of staff-patient relationships as assessed from the subjective self-report scales of staff and patients. Patients seemed to be sensitive to staff feelings for them: patient ratings of perceived feelings and thoughts from staff were significantly correlated with staff expressed feelings both from the cfi ee ratings and the direct self-report staff measures. Staff tended to view the behaviors of patients they felt less positively disposed toward as more controllable, and this association between less benign explanations of behavior and a more critical attitude is consistent with the attribution research for familial caregivers. The more negatively perceived patient group was found to be more likely to have behavioral disturbances in the 7 months after the relationship ratings were made.

However, researchers have hypothesized that the content of the voice-hearing experience and its cultural context are relevant to stigma responses. This study experimentally tested how perceptions of voice-hearing experiences change as a function of the voice's content and the perceiver's characteristics. Method: in total, 143 nonclinical participants were presented with vignettes describing people who heard voices that were attributed to either ``god'' or ``abraham lincoln'' and were described as either complimentary/encouraging or insulting/threatening. For each vignette, participants were asked about the likelihood that the voice-hearer had schizophrenia or mental illness. The causal beliefs questionnaire was also delivered, with two new subscales added to test for belief in positive and negative religious causes for the voices. Stigma was measured by perceived dangerousness and desire for social distance. Results: voice-hearing experiences elicited greater stigma from participants who endorsed greater likelihood that the voice-hearer was mentally ill, greater belief in biological causes of the voice-hearing, negative religious causes, psychosocial causes, socialization causes, and causes related to personal responsibility. Endorsing positive religious causes was associated with lower stigma. Participants who were more religious were more likely to attribute voice-hearing experiences to negative religious causes (possession, lack of/misguided faith), except when the target was described as hearing the voice of god saying positive things. Conclusions and implications for practice: the stigma of voice-hearing experiences depends upon what the voice is saying and perceptions about the cause of the voice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,VOICE-HEARING;STIGMA;PSYCHOSIS;SOCIAL FUNCTIONING;SCHIZOPHRENIA,,

The substantial lack of mental health services and the stigma associated with mental illness on the one hand; and poverty, unemployment, and lack of reasonable hopes for a decent future in the context of corruption of regimes and perceived social injustice on the other, call for establishing committed and effective policies to tackle depression and its associated stigma among arab adolescents at risk for or diagnosed with depression. The overarching purpose of this study was to estimate a prevalence of depression symptoms among arab adolescents, and determine relationships with depression stigma, depression etiologic beliefs, and likelihood to seek help for depression. Methods: this study was conducted in jordan, a middle eastern arab country. A pilot study with a sample of 88 jordanian adolescents was first conducted to assess the feasibility of collaboration and coordination with the proposed recruitment sites; assess proposed recruitment strategies; confirm the utility of the translated self-reported measures and examining their psychometric properties; and obtaining preliminary findings. Based on the lessons learned from this pilot study, we designed a nationally representative, school-based survey. Data were collected from 2,349 adolescents aged 12--17, using a packet of self-administered questionnaires that included measures on sociodemographic and health history, depression severity, depression stigma, depression etiologic beliefs, and likelihood to seek help for depression. A passive consenting procedure was used to obtain parental consents, while returning the survey questionnaires was considered a tacit assent for the adolescents. The study obtained the needed institutional review board approvals from both duke university and the university of jordan.

Results: the majority of the adolescents were females (59%) and 15--17 years old (67%). Almost 14% reported having at least one chronic health problem, 15% reported having a mental health problem, 25% reported having academic difficulties, 8% reported that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, and 22% reported that they had sought psychological help at some point in the past. The mean total depression score was 16.3 (sd=11.2, 95% ci=15.8 to 16.7), with 34% of the sample reporting moderate to severe depression. Depression was significantly higher among respondents who were female, ages 14--15 years, and living in families with monthly incomes less than jd300 (usd 423); and who reported having a chronic health problem, mental health problem, learning difficulty, a psychiatric diagnosis and/or seeking previous psychological help. Adolescents endorsed multiple etiological factors for depression. The most often reported factors were stressful events in one's life (72%), social factors (65%), and one's weak will (56%). On the other hand, the least reported factors were genetic or inherited problems (24%), chemical imbalance (30%), and punishment for wrong doings (35%). Adolescents were more likely to seek help for depression from a family member (57%), followed by a counselor (46%), psychiatrist (43%), religious leader (39%), and general practitioner (28%). In addition, 53% of the adolescents reported they will be willing to take medications for depression, while 50% expressed willingness to seek a therapy, and 25% of the adolescents reported they will not be willing to seek any professional help for depression. Almost half of the adolescents agreed on items that reflect stigmatizing attitudes towards depression.

Our objectives were 1) study the variables associated with the presence of depression in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (dm1), 2) to analyze potential risk factors for depression in these patients, and 3) to study a possible explanatory model of depression scores in these patients. Patients and methods: 207 patients with dm1. We evaluated sociodemographic and biomedical variables by means of a structured interview. We assessed psychological variables by means of the scale for depression in type 1 diabetes (eddi-1) and the spanish version of diabetes quality of life (es dqol). Results: prevalence of depression was 21,7\%. Variables associated with risk of depression in this sample were to be female; be unemployed; smoking; having complications of diabetes or other physical conditions; not perceiving family support or support from friends or colleagues in relation to diabetes; having a high number of weekly hyperglycemia; and a poor quality of life. A model based on previous research was obtained. This model explains a high percentage of the variability in the scores of patients in the eddi-1. Conclusions: these results provide an empirical support to the knowledge of the risk factors associated with depression in patients with dm1. Glycemic control and quality of life have an important effect on the scores of depression in these patients, providing information for their treatment. (C) 2009 elsevier espana, s.l.

We have previously shown that behaviour of serotonin transporter knockout (5-htt-/-) rats-mimicking the common 5-htt promoter polymorphism in humansis strongly driven by pavlovian css. To investigate whether the knockout rats attribute greater incentive salience to css, we tested the 5-htt-/- rats and their wild-type counterparts in the sucrose-reinforced sign-versus goal-tracking task. We also assessed whether motivational properties of the unconditioned stimulus (sucrose pellet) are involved in the individual differences under investigation, by testing the animals in a sucrose-reinforced progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. We found no genotype differences in sign-versus goal-tracking behavior, despite that progressive ratio responding was increased in 5-htt-/- rats. In conclusion, the high cs sensitivity in 5-htt-/- rats cannot be explained by enhanced incentive salience attribution to the cs as measured by the sign- versus goal-tracking paradigm. Rather, 5-htt-/- rats may be more sensitive to the motivational properties of the unconditioned stimulus.

Affected individuals are reported to suffer from severe mental disorders and are often unable to achieve long-term abstinence via recommended discontinuation strategies. Although it is increasingly understood that treatment interventions should take subjective experiences and beliefs into account, the perceptions of this group of individuals remain under-investigated. Methods we conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 41 adult subjects meeting criteria for (high-dose) bzd-dependence, as defined by icd-10. One-on-one in-depth interviews allowed for an exploration of this group's views on the reasons behind their initial and then continued use of bzds, as well as their procurement strategies. Mayring's qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate our data. Results in this sample, all participants had developed explanatory models for why they began using bzds. We identified a multitude of reasons that we grouped into four broad categories, as explaining continued bzd use: (1) to cope with symptoms of psychological distress or mental disorder other than substance use, (2) to manage symptoms of physical or psychological discomfort associated with somatic disorder, (3) to alleviate symptoms of substance-related disorders, and (4) for recreational purposes, that is, sensation-seeking and other social reasons. Subjects often considered bzds less dangerous than other substances and associated their use more often with harm reduction than as recreational. Specific obtainment strategies varied widely: the majority of participants oscillated between legal and illegal methods, often relying on the black market when faced with treatment termination. Conclusions irrespective of comorbidity, participants expressed a clear preference for medically related explanatory models for their bzd use. We therefore suggest that clinicians consider patients' motives for long-term, high-dose bzd use when formulating treatment plans for this patient group, especially since it is known that individuals are more compliant with approaches they perceive to be manageable, tolerable, and effective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded"", ""Ian""=>""Included""}",,NA;Benzodiazepines,,

Sexual dysfunction, common in general medical practice, is under-recognized and inadequately managed resulting in significant morbidity and reduction in quality of life. We examined the nature, prevalence, clinical features and explanatory models of illness among men with sexual dysfunction in a general healthcare setting. Methods. We recruited 270 consecutive men attending a general health clinic. Participants were evaluated using a structured interview. The international index of erectile function-5, the chinese index of premature ejaculation-5, short explanatory model interview and the revised clinical interview schedule were used to assess sexual dysfunction, explanatory models and psychiatric morbidity. Results. Premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction were reported by 43.0\% and 47.8\% of men, respectively. The most common perceived causes were loss of semen due to masturbation and nocturnal emission. Popular treatments were herbal remedies and resources used were traditional healers. The factors associated with erectile dysfunction were diabetes mellitus, financial stress, past history of psychiatric treatment and common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety; those associated with premature ejaculation were common mental disorders, older age and financial debt. Sexual dysfunctions and concerns were under-diagnosed by physicians when compared to the research interview. Conclusion.

The authors hypothesized that the grief-related concordance within a couple 2 to 6 years after the loss of a premature baby could be an indicator of shared emotional distress within a couple. Objective: the authors investigated the long-term grief experience among couples. Method: a group of 44 parents (22 couples) were assessed by questionnaire regarding grief, suffering, posttraumatic growth, and affective symptoms, and semi structured interviews with 6 couples added qualitative information about processes within couples. Results: the extent of grief concordance was found to be related to different patterns of suffering and posttraumatic growth within couples. Conclusion: the emotional exchange between partners after the loss of the child appears to be crucial for a process of concordant grief, which in turn is associated with a more synchronous process of individual posttraumatic growth.

Theories of illness cognition and stress vulnerability served as guides for selection of study variables. A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used to determine subjects' beliefs about and experiences with their illness. Data were collected on measures of illness representation (illness perception questionnaire [ipq]), early warning symptoms (early symptom scale [ess]), daily hassles (daily hassles scale-revised [dhs-r]), mood (profile of mood states-short form-[poms-sf]), current symptoms (psychiatric assessment scale [pas] and the symptom scale of the ipq [ipq-s]). Semistructured interviews provided information about illness history, knowledge of illness processes, and learned methods for illness management. Sixty-nine subjects were recruited from five settings. Their mean age was 44.3 years; 54% were female, and 86% were single, divorced, or widowed. Forty-nine percent were diagnosed with schizophrenia, 36% with schizo-affective disorders, and 14% with psychosis, nos. Average years of treatment were 19.2 and mean number of hospitalizations were 6.14. The ipq measured subjects' beliefs about cause, time line, consequences, and control/cure of their illness. Causes were attributed to stress, heredity, state of mind, and other people. Subjects noted consequences from their long-term illness but believed they could control aspects of their illness. Internal consistency reliability was noted for consequences and symptom subscales only. Subjects selected similar symptoms across mood states, early warning symptoms, and current symptoms. Common experiences were trouble concentrating, difficulty remembering things, depression, worry, fatigue, tension, and nervousness. Subjects reported daily hassles concerning weight; trouble relaxing; regrets over past decisions; troubling thoughts about the future; being lonely; trouble with spelling, reading, and arithmetic; and filling out forms. Study variables that correlated with ipq consequence and symptoms subscales were dhs-r and three subscales of the poms-sf (e.g., fatigue, tension, and confusion). Illness histories noted symptom awareness, consequences, and efforts to control symptoms. Self-regulation activities suggested subjects used early warning symptoms, stress reduction activities, and help seeking from providers or self-help groups.

rayyan-470329846,A Diathesis-Stress Model Of Chronic Pain And Disability Following Traumatic Injury.,2002,1,1,PAIN RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT,,,,,TURK DC,,,,,"One of the perplexing features of pain is the wide variability in patients' responses to ostensibly the same extent of physical pathology. A range of cognitive, affective and behavioural factors are related to the perception of pain, maintenance of pain and disability, exacerbation of pain and response to treatment. Moreover, there is some evidence that individual differences and prior learning history also have a significant influence on the experience of pain and related disability. The role of these psychological factors in the maintenance of disability following traumas such as motor vehicle accidents and work-related injuries has generated considerable interest. This paper provides a brief overview of a set of predisposing factors, cognitive processes and behavioural principles that appear to be particularly important in the maintenance of disability following trauma. In particular, anxiety sensitivity, anticipation and avoidance of fear or harm, catastrophizing ideation, causal attributions for symptoms, self-efficacy and operant conditioning are discussed. Each of these factors is integrated in a diathesis-stress model that emphasizes the interaction of predisposing factors with a trauma, setting in motion a cascade of interpretive cognitive processes and reinforcement contingencies that maintain disability following the trauma. This model proposes a sequential process to explain the variation observed among people following a relatively minor trauma. The model is intended to be heuristic. It may be a useful conceptualization that can serve to guide prevention efforts and the development of treatment interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,DISABLED PERSONS*;MODELS;BIOLOGICAL*;DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY/*COMPLICATIONS;PAIN/*ETIOLOGY;STRESS;PHYSIOLOGICAL/*COMPLICATIONS;WOUNDS AND INJURIES/*COMPLICATIONS;WOUNDS AND INJURIES/*PHYSIOPATHOLOGY;CHRONIC DISEASE;HUMANS;Disease Susceptibility,,

Dynamic measurement procedures are supposed to uncover the zone of proximal development and to increase predictive validity in comparison to conventional, static measurement procedures. Aims. Two alternative explanations for the discrepancies between static and dynamic measurements were investigated. The first focuses on vygotsky's learning potential theory, the second considers the role of anxiety tendency during test taking. If test anxious tendencies are mitigated by dynamic testing procedures, in particular the availability of assistance, the concept of the zone of proximal development may be superfluous in explaining the differences between the outcomes of static and dynamic measurement. Sample. Participants were students from secondary education in the netherlands. They were tested repeatedly in grade three as well as in grade four. Participants were between 14 and 17 years old; their average age was 15.4 years with a standard deviation of .52. Method. Two types of mathematics tests were used in a longitudinal experiment. The first type of test consisted of open-ended items, which participants had to solve completely on their own. With the second type of test, assistance was available to participants during the test. The latter so-called learning test was conceived of as a dynamic testing procedure. Furthermore, a test anxiety questionnaire was administered repeatedly. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data. Results. Apart from emotionality and worry, lack of self-confidence appears to be an important constituent of test anxiety. The learning test appears to contribute to the predictive validity of conventional tests and thus a part of vygotsky's claims were substantiated. Moreover, the mere inclusion of a test anxiety factor into an explanatory model for the gathered data is not sufficient. Apart from test anxiety and mathematical ability it is necessary to assume a factor which may be construed as mathematics learning potential. Conclusion. The results indicate that the observed differences between a conventional, static testing procedure and an experimental, dynamic testing procedure for mathematics cannot be explained sufficiently by a differential bias towards test anxiety. The dynamic testing approach renders scores which add to the predictive validity of conventional testing procedures. Since this gain in predictive validity is not a result of the removal of bias towards test anxiety, this result should be understood as supportive for the validity of the concept of the zone of proximal development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Discrimination (Psychology),,

Two groups of subjects emerged from our analysis: one medically oriented group that viewed depression as a medical condition and expressed optimism regarding its prognosis and one spiritually oriented group that expressed pessimism. Correlations emerged between etiological belief, degree of optimism, and associated stigma. The subjects were pessimistic when they attributed depression to a traumatic event, punishment from god, or brain disease but optimistic when depression was attributed to socioeconomic circumstances. Overall, the subjects were knowledgeable and open-minded toward depression and demonstrated curiosity and willingness to learn more. This study will help to inform future clinical and educational outreach in rural gujarat.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Included""}",,DEPRESSION;GUJARAT;KNOWLEDGE;STIGMA;RURAL INDIA;India,,

A variety of factors can influence how stigma is ascribed to individuals with aud, including biogenetic etiology and different drinking contexts. The present study aimed to better understand how factors surrounding aud interact to impact stigma. Participants (n = 449) recruited from amazon mechanical turk read one of eight vignettes that described a character with aud who was (a) either drinking to cope with stress or drinking socially, (b) either a college student or a nonstudent young adult, and (c) either had or did not have a genetic predisposition to aud. Participants rated the perceived controllability of the alcohol problem as well as blame, pity, desired social distance, and likelihood of helping. Participants who were told the vignette target had a genetic predisposition reported lower 4 perceptions of control of drinking onset, lower blame, and reduced desire for social distance. Moreover, they reported less of a perception that social drinking is a personal choice and more controllable. While social drinking and drinking to cope were blamed similarly, when a genetic predisposition was present, an individual who drank for social facilitation received higher levels of pity and intention to help than an individual who drank to cope. Both drinking context and genetic predisposition matter when it comes to the stigmatization of aud. Genetic predispositions may be particularly impactful in affecting stigma in the context of social drinking.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,STIGMA;ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD);ATTRIBUTION THEORY;Alcoholics;Drinking,,

The pm ss completed the questionnaire twice: once with regard to their own opinions and then in the role of a typical member of the austrian public who was either for or against ne. Public attitudes toward the use of ne were based on 4 underlying belief dimensions: psychological (anxiety-inducing) risks, economic/technical benefits; sociopolitical implications, and environmental/physical risks. The pm ss' attitudes were significantly more favorable than those of the total public sample. Pm ss were able to shift their own personal responses in the directions required by the role-play assignment to accurately reproduce the overall attitudes of the pro and con groups, although there was a tendency to overestimate the positive attitudes of the pro-ne ss.

An important finding is that the factor structure for the explanatory models remained stable when applied to both forensic and nonforensic cases. As a first investigation, significant differences were observed in prototypical cases of malingering by the category of referral (forensic or nonforensic) and by type of feigning (mental disorders, cognitive impairment and medical syndromes). Surprisingly, the feigning of medical syndromes appeared to play a relatively prominent role in both forensic and nonforensic cases and to be influenced by the apparent adversarial context of the assessment finally important gender differences were observed, especially with nonforensic prototypical cases of malingering.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Two preregistered studies, one using a common attribution methodology (i.e., vignettes) and another utilizing video public service announcements (psas), were conducted to test an expanded version of the attribution-emotion-action helping behavior model that included expectations as an additional mediator. Structural equation modeling assessed whether altering the perceived stability of a depressive episode would influence willingness to provide social (wpss) and general support (wpgs) through sympathy, anger, and social support outcome expectations (ssoes). Associations among sympathy, anger, and ssoes were also hypothesized. Study 1 indicated that describing a bout of depression as temporary (vs. Permanent) had an indirect effect on wpss/wpgs through anger and ssoes. A negative bidirectional relationship between anger and ssoes was also indicated. Study 2 tested how informing participants, via psas, that an episode of depression can be temporary influenced stigma. This study was a more conservative test that did not include 'permanent' as a foil condition, but rather compared 2 antistigma psas that were identical apart from information on temporality. Results indicated that the 'temporary' (vs. Control) psa indirectly influenced wpss/wpgs through ssoes. Moreover, although the temporary psa did not influence anger, higher ssoes were associated with lower levels of anger, which were associated with greater wpss/wpgs. These results demonstrate the benefit of including ssoes in attribution studies of helping behavior and highlight the potential utility of adding temporality information to antistigma psas.

In many cases it leads to disability and results in a decreased quality of life and increased levels of anxiety and depression. The problem that needs to be addressed is the following: which mental processes lead to increased levels of depression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?; Methods: 210 patients with rheumatoid arthritis hospitalized in rheumatology wards took part in the research. They filled in illness perception questionnaires (ipq-r) and questionnaires for testing strategies of handling stress (mini-cope) and the level of depression (ces-d).; Results: the observed correlation coefficients indicate that several elements of the perception of one's disease moderately contribute to a high level of depression. Moreover, frequent use of dysfunctional coping strategies contributed to high levels of depression. Dysfunctional coping was moderately linked to depression.; Conclusion: the conducted analyses confirmed the links between the beliefs about the disease and levels of depression and showed that the use of dysfunctional coping strategies mediates the relationship between the following elements of the representation of the disease: illness coherence, emotional representation, psychological attribution, risk factors, and the level of depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ian""=>""Excluded""}",,"ADAPTATION;PSYCHOLOGICAL*;CULTURE*;ARTHRITIS;RHEUMATOID/*COMPLICATIONS;RHEUMATOID/*PSYCHOLOGY;DEPRESSION/*ETIOLOGY;ADULT;AGED;80 AND OVER;ANXIETY/ETIOLOGY;FEMALE;HUMANS;MALE;MIDDLE AGED;RISK FACTORS;SEVERITY OF ILLNESS INDEX;Arthritis, Rheumatoid",,
rayyan-470329860,Do Thinking Patterns Predict Depressive Symptoms?,1986,1,1,COGNITIVE THERAPY AND RESEARCH,,,,,RUSH AJ and WEISSENBURGER J and EAVES G,,,,,"Examined whether depressive symptomatology is related to the persistence, during recent symptomatic remission, of either dysfunctional attitudes, as hypothesized by a. T. Beck's (1967, 1976) cognitive theory of depression, or attributional biases, as predicted by the reformulated learned helplessness theory (l. Y. Abramson et al; see record [rid]1979-00305-001[/rid]). Results from the clinical reassessment of 15 depressed female psychiatric inpatients (aged 2763 yrs) who had participated in a previous investigation by the 3rd and 1st authors indicate that biased attributions did not relate either to the course of the depressive disorder or to symptom severity at the 6-mo follow-up. However, consistent with beck's cognitive theory, dysfunctional attitudes after recent clinical remission correlated with subsequent symptom severity. Results suggest that persistent dysfunctional attitudes during recent clinical remission may predict subsequent vulnerability to depressive symptoms and that these attitudes may be a more sensitive indicator of persistent depressive psychopathology than the classical signs and symptoms of a depressive episode.

Each year teacch offers a series of intensive, five-day summer training institutes designed to introduce participants to the topics considered central to the teacch philosophy. In addition to the summer training institutes, division teacch offers a number of two-day training workshops throughout the academic year. A previous study (grindstaff, 1998) represented the first attempt to evaluate these training programs. The current study is both a refinement and an expansion of the first. It was hypothesized that training would increase participants' knowledge of autism, reduce their controllable attributions regarding the (mis)behaviors characteristic of children with autism, increase their self-efficacy with regard to changing those behaviors, and reduce negative affect in response to such behavior. Training was also expected to increase participants' use of structured teaching, the specific instructional strategy espoused by the training programs. Furthermore, it was predicted that the summer training institutes would have a greater impact upon participants compared to the training workshops. A series of ancovas revealed several significant findings. First, both types of training were equally effective for increasing participants' knowledge of autism. Secondly, both types of training reduced participants' ratings for the controllability of child behavior. Thirdly, participants from the summer training institutes (but not from the training workshops) demonstrated an increase in their use of structured teaching. The study failed to find a significant increase in participants' self-efficacy, nor was there a significant decrease in negative affect. Multiple regression analyses revealed that increased knowledge and 'uncontrollable' attributions were significant predictors for participants' use of structured teaching. Based on these results, recommendations were made for improving the effectiveness of the teacch training programs and for further evaluation of training programs in general.

A sample of 20 boys (9 with hfa and 11 with as) and 20 age-matched controls were recruited for this study. All participated in two tasks measuring social attribution ability, the conventional social attribution task (sat) and a modified version with animals rather than shapes (msat). They also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests. Compared to typically developing controls, children with autism spectrum disorders were impaired on some measures in both sats. However, group differences in theory-of-mind indices were only significant in the msat, with the asd group performing more poorly than controls. In addition, the scores in person index of both versions of the sat correlated with executive function in children with hfa/as. The current study found the msat paradigm was especially sensitive to tom difficulties in young chinese children with hfa/as. Social attribution in children with hfa/as, unlike neurotypical children, was related to executive function ability, suggesting these psychological domains are not distinct in children with autism spectrum disorders.
