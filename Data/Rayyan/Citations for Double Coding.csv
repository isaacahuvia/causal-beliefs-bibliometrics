1,"Pathways To Childhood Depressive Symptoms: The Role Of Social, Cognitive, And Genetic Risk Factors",LAU JYF;RIJSDIJK F;GREGORY AM;MCGUFFIN P;ELEY TC,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,2007,,,"Childhood depressive conditions have been explored from multiple theoretical approaches but with few empirical attempts to address the interrelationships among these different domains and their combined effects. In the present study, the authors examined different pathways through which social, cognitive, and genetic risk factors may be expressed to influence depressive symptoms in 300 pairs of child twins from a longitudinal study. Path analysis supported several indirect routes. First, risks associated with living in a step- or single-parent family and punitive parenting did not directly influence depressive outcome but were instead mediated through maternal depressive symptoms and child negative attributional style. Second, the effects of negative attributional style on depressive outcome were greatly exacerbated in the presence of precipitating negative life events. Third, independent of these social and cognitive risk mechanisms, modest genetic effects were also implicated in symptoms, with some indication that these risks are expressed through exposure to negative stressors. Together, these routes accounted for approximately 13% of total phenotypic variance in depressive symptoms. Theoretical and analytical implications of these results are discussed in the context of several design-related caveats.

2,An Exploration Of The Nature And Causes Of Distress In Women Attending Gynecology Outpatient Clinics,GLOVER L;NOVAKOVIC A;HUNTER MS,JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY,,,,,2002,,,"This study evaluates the distress experienced by women attending gynecology outpatient clinics (gocs). We investigate causes of this distress and explore women's own experience of their distress. A questionnaire survey of 197 women attending gocs was carried out, both quantitative and qualitative analyses were undertaken. Thirty-five percent of women showed clinical levels of anxiety, 13% had clinically significant depression and half reported feeling distressed. A range of feelings was reported, though commonly mixed emotions were expressed. Women had a low sense of personal control and uncertainty in relation to their gynecologic problem. Both coincidental stress, such as life changes, and the direct consequences of the gynecologic problem were predictive of anxiety. Qualitative analysis suggested four ways in which women experienced their distress and the gynecologic problem: (i) gynecologic symptoms were a direct cause of distress, (ii) gynecologic symptoms caused distress indirectly through reactions to diagnosis and treatment, (iii) gynecologic symptoms caused distress because of their impact on relationships, social life and self identity, and (iv) distress was unrelated to the gynecologic symptoms. Results highlight diversity and complexity in women's experiences and support the need for a fuller understanding of distress in this group in order to meet their needs adequately and appropriately.

3,Narratives Of Suffering Of South Asian Immigrant Survivors Of Domestic Violence,KALLIVAYALIL DJ,NA,,,,,2007,,,"This study examines the mental health consequences of domestic violence against south asian immigrant women. Using a combination of standard psychological assessments and narrative interviews, it examines women's own narratives of suffering to examine cultural representations of their abuse experiences and their consequences to shed light on how community-specific explanatory models, metaphors, and idioms add to and diverge from traditional psychiatric symptoms and categories. Dsm diagnoses did appear be relevant outcomes for this population and women met criteria for a number of critical psychiatric diagnoses. Depression, ptsd, and anxiety disorders were the most common of these diagnoses, as has also been reflected in the mainstream literature. Further, many of the narratives were strongly influenced by the experience of chronic intimate violence and captivity, which were not comprehensively captured by the dsm system. A critical finding was that herman's (1992) complex ptsd concept more accurately captured these chronic trauma outcomes for south asian immigrant women than the dsm ptsd diagnosis. The narratives also elucidated larger themes of experience that painted a picture of the close dialectic relationship between personal suffering, and larger structures such as the arranged marriage system, immigration, city agencies, and mental health interventions. The narratives obtained for this study illustrate the women's own perceptions of their suffering and symptoms, and provided a window into the south asian immigrant community's ideologies or moral domains regarding gender, violence, and sickness. They thus illustrate how migration and culture interact with the deeply personal experience of suffering caused by domestic violence.

4,Attribution Theory And Reducing Stigma Toward Women With Postpartum Depression: Examining The Role Of Perceptions Of Stability,RUYBAL AL;SIEGEL JT,STIGMA AND HEALTH,,,,,2019,,,"Beyond dealing with the negative impact of depression, women with postpartum depression (ppd) also experience the burden of stigma. Guided by weiner’s attribution-emotion-action model, the current studies assessed whether emphasizing the temporary nature of ppd indirectly results in greater willingness to provide social support, through anger and sympathy. Reduced anger and increased sympathy were also predicted to be associated with increased relationship closeness as well as more favorable social support outcome expectations. A cross-sectional study (n = 90) demonstrated an indirect effect between the stability of ppd and higher levels of willingness to provide social support, relationship closeness, and social support outcome expectations through decreased anger and increased sympathy. In study 2 (n = 139), participants were randomly assigned to read a vignette that described a hypothetical situation in which a loved one’s ppd was temporary or stable. We hypothesized that reading about temporary rather than ongoing ppd would be associated with higher levels of willingness to provide social support, relationship closeness, and social support outcome expectations, through decreased anger and increased sympathy. The hypotheses were partially supported. The experimental manipulation was associated with higher levels of willingness to provide social support, relationship closeness, and social support outcome expectations, through sympathy, but there was no influence of condition on anger. The results highlight the applicability of attribution theory to the ppd domain, provide insight into the stigmatization of women with ppd, and offer a possible path for reducing ppd stigmatization (i.e., interventions espousing the temporary nature of ppd).

5,Attributional Biases In Aggressive Children And Their Mothers,MACBRAYER EK;MILICH R;HUNDLEY M,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,2003,,,"To investigate if mothers and their aggressive children share the tendency to infer hostile motives from others' behavior in ambiguous social situations, 100 pairs of mothers and their clinic-referred or comparison children (50 boys and 50 girls) were asked to interpret hypothetical situations involving both overtly and relationally provocative scenarios. Results replicated previous findings of studies on social information processing of aggressive children and extended the findings to mothers of aggressive children. Findings were generally consistent with the hypothesis that mothers of aggressive children tend to view others' ambiguous actions as hostile, increasing the probability of responding with aggression and, in effect, modeling a hostile attributional bias for their children. Examinations of mothers' and their children's attributional and behavioral intentions suggested that mothers' and daughters' attributions and behavioral intentions were significantly correlated, whereas mothers' and sons' were not. Gender effects with regard to provocation type are also discussed.

7,Causal Attributions For Psychological Illness Among Turkish Psychiatric In-Patients And Their Relationships With Hope.,KARANCI NA,THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY,,,,,1986,,,"The causal attributions for psychological illness were investigated in a sample of seventy turkish psychiatric in-patients, using the levels of causal attributions proposed by the transtheoretical model of prochaska (1984). The factor analysis of replies to a questionnaire tapping various levels of causality revealed seven factors which were greatly overlapping with the causal attributional levels proposed by the transtheoretical model and verified in western samples. However, there were important dissimilarities on attributions to family, self, and interpersonal conflicts. Family conflicts and interpersonal conflicts appeared as two separate causal factors, whereas attributions to personal symptoms and family conflicts merged under a single higher-order factor. Results also revealed that types of attributions were related to hope for future well-being. The results and their implications were discussed within the framework of the transtheoretical model, attribution theory research and studies on the turkish family structure and values.",,,ATTITUDE TO HEALTH*; CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS*; CULTURE*; MENTAL DISORDERS/*PSYCHOLOGY; ADOLESCENT; ADULT; AGED; ALCOHOLISM/PSYCHOLOGY; ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER/PSYCHOLOGY; ANXIETY DISORDERS/PSYCHOLOGY; DEPRESSIVE DISORDER/PSYCHOLOGY; FEMALE; HUMANS; MALE; MIDDLE AGED; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER/PSYCHOLOGY; PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGIC DISORDERS/PSYCHOLOGY; TURKEY
8,"An Investigation Of The Relationship Among Family Process, Depression, And Quality Of Life To Medical Adherence In Cardiac Patients: A Family Systems Approach",BARTLEY AG,NA,,,,,2005,,,"Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the united states since 1918 (american heart association, 2003). Cardiac rehabilitation (cr), which is the treatment protocol for heart disease, has been widely accepted as beneficial for cardiac patients (hevey, et al., 2003; thompson, et al. 2003). Even though the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation is well-documented, only 11-38% of patients needing cr services receive them (wenger, et al., 1995). Although there is information available regarding adherence-enhancing strategies while in cr (oldridge & jones, 1983), little information is available about which variables or combination of variables that influence participation in cr. The present study evaluated the family systems-illness model (rolland, 1994), in particular the psychosocial typology of the family, along with patient depression and quality of life, to medical adherence in the cardiac population. The sample consisted of 100 heart patients hospitalized at a medium-sized hospital in the midwest and 85 of their primary support partners. Each heart patient completed the enrichd social support inventory, family assessment device, beck depression inventory, short-form health survey-36, and a demographic questionnaire before actual participation in cardiac rehabilitation. Significant support persons filled out the enrichd social support inventory, family assessment device and a demographic questionnaire. Results indicated that the overall model was not statistically reliable in distinguishing between those who attended and those who did not attend cardiac rehabilitation. Ultimately the intent of this study was to identify markers indicating potential nonadherence to medical protocols. Since results were inconclusive, it is suggested that additional factors be explored in conjunction with the factors presented in this research.

9,Fostering Self-Regulated Skills In An Educational Psychology Course For Brazilian Preservice Teachers,BORUCHOVITCH E;GANDA DR,JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,2013,,,"The relevance of self-regulated learning is well acknowledged by research, and converging evidence suggests that people can be taught self-regulatory skills, thus improving their behavior as learners. Researchers have recommended that educational psychology courses for preservice teachers should help future teachers become better learners as well as more effective teachers. An attempt was made to explore the challenge of creating an effective teaching approach to increase preservice teachers' awareness of their personal learning. This idea was implemented in an educational psychology course for 26 brazilian students in a teacher education program at a public university in the interior of the state of sao paulo, brazil. The procedures employed to foster self-regulatory skills and the results obtained from the experience are discussed in this article. Data were collected on 2 occasions using a self-efficacy for self-regulated learning scale and a general self-reflective activity. A structured diary about the students' learning experiences was also required. Results showed reported gains in self-regulatory skills, greater awareness of affective and motivational states, and an improvement in study practices. Findings are discussed in terms of both the importance of improving students' self-regulatory skills and the implications that such an initiative may have for future teaching practices.

Fear and anxiety are associated with reduced activity, which can further affect balance and fall risk. Understanding and intervening on falls in this population is essential. The aims of this narrative review are to provide an overview of the current knowledge and applied methods on fall incidence, causes, and injuries in bilateral vestibulopathy. Observations eleven articles reporting falls incidence in people with bilateral vestibulopathy were deemed eligible, including 3 prospective and 8 retrospective studies, with a total of 359 participants, of whom 149 (42\%) fell during the assessed period. When reported, the most common perceived causes of falls were loss of balance, darkness, and uneven ground. Information on sustained injuries was limited, with bruises and scrapes being the most common, and only 4 fractures were reported. As most studies included falls as a secondary, descriptive outcome measure, fall data obtained using best practice guidelines were lacking. Only 6 studies reported their definition of a fall, of which 2 studies explicitly reported the way participants were asked about their fall status. Only 3 studies performed a prospective daily fall assessment using monthly fall diaries (a recommended practice), whereas the remaining studies retrospectively collected fall-related data through questionnaires or interviews. While most studies reported the number of people who did and did not fall, the number of total falls in individual studies was lacking. Conclusions and relevance the findings from this review suggest that falls in people with bilateral vestibulopathy are common but remain an understudied consequence of the disease. Larger prospective studies that follow best practice guidelines for fall data collection with the aim of obtaining and reporting fall data are required to improve current fall risk assessments and interventions in bilateral vestibulopathy.",,,NA

12,An Exploration Of The Factor Structure And Development Of Potentially Useful Subscales Of Etiological Beliefs About Schizophrenia In A General Population Sample,GOULDING SM;BROUSSARD B;DEMIR B;COMPTON MT,SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY,,,,,2009,,,"Background given that accessing care, treatment engagement, and course and outcomes among people with schizophrenia may be influenced by beliefs about causes in the larger community, causal beliefs about schizophrenia have been studied in numerous communities around the world. In particular, the 30-item list of etiological attributions developed by angermeyer and colleagues has been used to describe causal beliefs in patients, family members, and lay community members within such communities. The current study, the first examination of the latent or factorial structure of these 30 causal beliefs, seeks to provide informative subscales that may enhance reliability and validity of groupings of causes for future analyses involving community members. Method data were gathered from six separate surveys involving three distinct groups of individuals from the same community within the southeastern united states: lay community members, relatives of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and police officers at the start of a 1-week mental health training program. Results exploratory factor analysis in the overall sample (n = 577) revealed four factors that were used to define four subscales, termed: personal/family/social stressors (14 items), inconsistent with modern conceptions of risk (8 items), external/environmental insults to the brain (6 items), and consistent with modern biological conceptions (2 items). Cronbach's internal consistency reliability coefficients for these subscales were 0.91, 0.83, 0.71, and 0.65, respectively. Conclusions these findings suggest that subscales could be derived to provide continuous measures for assessing causal beliefs in order to study how this concept relates to attitudes toward schizophrenia, the people affected by the disorder, and treatments that are recommended by mental health professionals.

13,Predicting Acute Anxiety And Depression Following Hip Fracture,BRUGGEMANN L;NIXON RDV;CAVENETT T,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,,,,,2007,,,"The role of injury-related beliefs and hopelessness on depression and anxiety in the acute phase following hip fracture was investigated in 103 hip fracture patients. Participants were assessed at two time points: as inpatients within one week of their surgery, and then 3-weeks later as outpatients. Abramson et al.'S (1989) theory of hopelessness-related depression was investigated as a possible explanatory model to account for depression following hip fracture. Results indicated that hopelessness mediated the relationship between beliefs regarding personal control and depression at the second assessment. Anxiety at follow-up was predicted by control beliefs whereas physical mobility, acute stress and pain made no significant contribution. This study is the first to provide tentative evidence that post-injury beliefs and hopelessness influence levels of depression and anxiety in hip fracture patients in the acute phase of their injury, and indicates that further study in this area is warranted.",,,ANXIETY; DEPRESSION; HOPELESSNESS; HIP FRACTURE; INJURY COGNITIONS
14,Processes Variables In The Determination Of The Generalized Anxiety And Its Generalization To Other Measurements Of Anxiety And Depression,GONZALEZ M;IBANEZ I;CUBAS R,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,2006,,,"According to the explanatory model proposed by dugas, gagnon, ladouceur and freeston, for the generalized anxiety disorder (gad), this ex post facto study proposes to test the role of the processes variables called intolerance of uncertainty, the beliefs on the worry and the suppression of intrusive thoughts, play in the determination of the tag; as well as the participation of these variables in the determination of other anxiety and mood disorders. A sample of 503 adults was assessed in generalized anxiety, components of panic attack, obsessive thoughts, fear to the negative evaluation, and depression. The results indicated that those three processes, besides in the generalized anxiety, also are in other measured variables, but with valuable variations. These variations go from de absence of some of those three processes to its implications, but with different predictive weights. The central role attributed in the model to the intolerance of uncertainty is modified in the case of obsessive thought, where the main variable is the cognitive avoidance process. The results are discussed in relation with the generalization of the processes variables to other disorders, specially in those co-morbids with tag.",,,PROCESSES VARIABLES; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; ANXIETY DISORDERS;; DEPRESSION; EX POST FACTO STUDY
15,Nucleus Accumbens Activation Is Linked To Salience In Social Decision Making,SCHMIDT SNL;FENSKE SC;KIRSCH P;MIER D,EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE,,,,,2019,,,"Aberrant salience may explain hasty decision making and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. In healthy individuals, final decisions in probabilistic reasoning tasks are related to nucleus accumbens (nacc) activation. However, research investigating the nacc in social decision making is missing. Our study aimed at investigating the role of the nacc for social decision making and its link to (aberrant) salience attribution. 47 healthy individuals completed a novel social jumping-to-conclusion (jtc) fmri-paradigm, showing morphed faces simultaneously expressing fear and happiness. Participants decided on the ‘current’ emotion after each picture, and on the ‘general’ emotion of series of faces. Nacc activation was stronger during final decisions than in previous trials without a decision, particularly in fear rather than happiness series. A jtc-bias was associated with higher nacc activation for last fearful, but not last happy faces. Apparently, mechanisms underlying probabilistic reasoning are also relevant for social decision making. The pattern of nacc activation suggests salience, not reward, drives the final decision. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that aberrant salience might also explain social-cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

San francisco: freeman], a self-blaming attribution style with accompanying shame-based emotion was predicted in a group of self-conscious shys, as compared with fearful shys and controls. Surprisingly, fearfulness and private, not public, self-consciousness predicted self-blame and shame in hypothetical interpersonal failure situations. Furthermore, trait-shame was predicted by the same combination. Results are discussed in terms of the interaction of negative emotion and inner focus on self-blame. (C) 2001 elsevier science ltd.

Only winners significantly showed a rise in hr during the competition followed by a decrease along the posttask phase in addition to more internal attributions. On the contrary, the average hr for losers during the competition was lower compared with their baseline values. No differences depending on the outcome were found in bp. The cardiovascular response as well as the subjective interpretation of the outcome suggest a more active strategy employed by winners vs a more passive strategy of losers. Future studies should specifically investigate the importance of coping strategies for psychophysiological adaptation to contests and for the outcome reached.

20,Attentional Mechanisms And Neuropsychological Syndromes,GARCIA-OGUETA MI,REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA,,,,,2001,,,"Introduction. Both cognitive psychology and neuropsychology require an approach to the multidimensional `attention : development. Attention permits behaviour to be suitable to the task in hand. According to the situation or activity required the components or mechanisms of attention necessary vary (selectivity, alertness, vigilance,focus, inhibitory control mechanisms, etc.) As do the different neural networks involved. In the different neuropsychological syndromes different components and attention mechanisms are affected. For instance, in attention deficit disorder there is inability to take notice of control of carrying out inappropriate responses, whilst in visual heminegligence there may be a defect of a mechanism such as disconnection of attention selective to a given space. To obtain coherent results in the study of attention disorders in various syndromes, the different components and attention mechanisms should be systematically evaluated using specific tests. In neuropsychology frequently the rests used only measured the aspects most closely connected to speed of perception and visual selective attention, without evaluating other components. Sometimes study data measuring different aspects of attention have been compared and therefore the conclusions drawn regarding possible attention disorders were controversial. The lack of standardised data and the difficulty of establishing `pure' tests of attention mechanisms make the task more arduous. Conclusion. Only the integration of experimental studies of cognitive psychology and the techniques and procedures of neuropsychology permit clarification of the construction and the advance of explanatory models.",,,ATTENTIONAL ASSESSMENT; ATTENTIONAL MECHANISMS; COMPONENTS OF ATTENTION;; NETWORKS OF ATTENTION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SYNDROMES

Depression remains a major public health problem, but little is known about the views and understandings of depression held by many ethnic groups. Aim. To explore views and understandings of depression in three ethnic groups-yoruba, sylheti-speaking bangladeshi and white british-living in south london. Design. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews, using vignettes describing depressed individuals. Setting. General practice and the community in southwark, south london, uk. Participants. 20 yoruba, 20 bangladeshi and 20 white british people, recruited from primary care. Methods. Interviews (in english for yoruba and white british, in sylheti for the bangladeshi participants) were recorded and transcribed. Atlas ti software was used to organize the data. Results. Views on the causes and cures for depression were diverse. A diagnosis of depression can have adverse social consequences in all groups. Magic had a role in both causation and cure in the yoruba and to a lesser extent in the bangladeshi groups. Religion was important for many people in all groups. Family factors were dominant in the bangladeshi participants, whilst the white british often identified more `psychological' causes of depression. Coping methods and health-seeking behaviours included religion, family, friends and neighbours, and becoming more active. Formal psychiatric interventions and taking antidepressants were not priorities. Conclusion. Cultural models of depression, including its causes and treatment, are diverse, and are different among cultural groups. This study raises questions about the value of western approaches to mild and moderate depression in these groups of patients.",,,DEPRESSION; ETHNICITY; HEALTH BELIEFS; PRIMARY CARE

Significantly more nurses were associated with verbal abuse (or 3.85, 95\% confidence interval 2.17-6.67) after adjusting for gender, age, and years in ooh primary care. Males had a higher risk for physical abuse (or 2.36, ci 1.11-5.05) and higher age was associated with lower risk for sexual harassment (or 0.28, ci 0.14-0.59), when adjusted for background variables. Drug influence and mental illness were the most frequently perceived causes for the last occurring episode of physical abuse, threats, and verbal abuse. Conclusion. This first study on occupational violence in norwegian ooh primary care found that a substantial number of health care workers experience occupational violence from patients or visitors. The employer should take action to prevent occupational violence in ooh primary care.",,,CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES; GENERAL PRACTICE; NURSES; OUT-OF-HOURS;; PHYSICIANS; PREVALENCE; VIOLENCE
25,Enacting Autism: Immigrant Family Negotiations With Nosology In Practice,PONDE MP;NICCOLETTA BASSI ARCAND LA;ROUSSEAU C,TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY,,,,,2019,,,"This article describes how autism spectrum disorder is experienced in the context of immigrant families and how the meaning of this condition, proposed by professionals in the host country, is negotiated between families and healthcare providers. The study sample consists of 44 parents of different nationalities and their 35 children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) living in a socioeconomically deprived neighborhood of montreal, canada. Individual parent interviews were audiotaped and transcribed for subsequent analysis. Results suggest that - although they may sometimes be a source of anxiety - the uncertainties regarding the etiology of asd, as well as the gap between the explanatory models (ems) proposed by host country professionals and the impressions of parents, seem to increase the capacity of families to resist the imposition of what they perceive as external categories. Parents perceived the day-to-day difficulties associated with their child's condition as a form of social exclusion that compromised their child's future and independence. These day-to-day difficulties were also described as directly affecting the parents' social life, constituting an important emotional and physical burden. When talking about their children, parents described the painfulness of their experiences, but also discussed how their autistic child had transformed and shaped their lives. Overall, these results show how the disease is ``enacted'' in the day-to-day life of parents; and suggest that such an embodied understanding of asd may sometimes represent a form of re-appropriation of power by families faced with adversity.",,,AUTISM; CULTURE; IMMIGRANTS; PARENTS; PRACTICE
26,Attributions For Negative Life Events And Depression: The Role Of Perceived Control,BROWN JD;SIEGEL JM,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,1988,,,"Although perceptions of control occupied a central role in the development of learned helplessness theory, recent helplessness research has not considered controllability judgments when relating attributions to depression. Supporting the importance of this construct, the research discussed in this article found evidence that judgments of control interact with other attributions in predicting depression. Specifically, in a prospective study of stress and well-being in adolescence, internal, stable, and global attributions for negative events attributed to uncontrollable causes were found to be positively related to increases in depression (as predicted by the reformulated helplessness theory), but internal and global attributions for negative events attributed to controllable causes were found to be inversely related to increases in depression. The discussion considers the implications of the findings for understanding the nature of the relation between attributions for naturally occurring life events and depression.

Both the structure and the objects of psychiatry have a hybrid nature, that is, they are configured by form and practices borrowed from the natural and human sciences. According to the cambridge school’s model of mental symptom formation, symptoms are psychic phenomena constituted by a rudimentary signal, of biological or semantic origin, which reaches the subject’s consciousness and which the patient must configure through cultural processes. This is not simply a matter of providing different contents to symptoms, but through a deep penetration, culture will act at a structural level. Several tasks will be necessary to assemble the process of symptom formation and configuration. The first will involve developing a methodology which allows the identification of the elements and structure of cultural configurators. The second will concern the implementing of a methodology which lends itself to empirical verification. And the third will necessitate the creation of an explanatory model of action of configurators which accounts for their ability to attenuate, distort, or abolish the biological signal. The realization of these tasks will be essential both for a better understanding of psychiatry and for the patients’ sake. (Psycinfo database record (c) 2022 apa, all rights reserved)",,,NA

Time-lagged multigenerational research suggests that differences exist, on average, in personality characteristics, work values, and mental health variables between baby boomers and gen xers. We postulate that these differences in individual attributes will lead to generational differences in the accepting of early retirement incentives, deciding whether to retire early, and taking a bridge position. Implications for the study of generational differences are discussed, along with practical strategies for human resource managers to retain retirement-eligible and near-retirement-eligible employees.

30,Computational Modelling Of Schizophrenic Symptoms: Basic Issues,TRETTER F;AN DER HEIDEN U;RUJESCU D;POGARELL O,PHARMACOPSYCHIATRY,,,,,2012,,,"Emerging ``(computational) systems medicine'' challenges neuropsychiatry regarding the development of heuristic computational brain models which help to explore symptoms and syndromes of mental disorders. This methodology of exploratory modelling of mental functions and processes and of their pathology requires a clear and operational definition of the target variable (explanandum). In the case of schizophrenia, a complex and heterogeneous disorder, single psychopathological key symptoms such as working memory deficiency, hallucination or delusion need to be defined first. Thereafter, measures of brain structures can be used in a multilevel view as biological correlates of these symptoms. Then, in order to formally ``explain'' the symptoms, a qualitative model can be constructed. In another step, numerical values have to be integrated into the model and exploratory computer simulations can be performed. Normal and pathological functioning is to be tested in computer experiments allowing the formulation of new hypotheses and questions for empirical research. However, the crucial challenge is to point out the appropriate degree of complexity (or simplicity) of these models, which is required in order to achieve an epistemic value that might lead to new hypothetical explanatory models and could stimulate new empirical and theoretical research. Some outlines of these methodological issues are discussed here, regarding the fact that measurements alone are not sufficient to build models.",,,METHODOLOGY; QUALITATIVE MODELLING; QUANTITATIVE MODELLING; COMPLEXITY;; SIMULATION

Method a total of 339 participants completed a 60-item questionnaire to compare lay theories of schizophrenia between british (in england) and chinese (in hong kong) participants. The participants completed the three-part questionnaire in their mother tongue looking at beliefs about schizophrenia in general, causal explanation for the aetiology of schizophrenia and optimal cures for the condition. It was hypothesized that the chinese would possess more negative attitudes and beliefs about schizophrenia than the british. It was also predicted that the chinese would tend to use primarily a sociological model to explain the aetiology of schizophrenia. Results these two hypotheses were confirmed after factor-analysing the internal structure of the three sections of the questionnaire. However, the chinese, compared to the british, did not use more superstitious beliefs to explain the behaviour of people with schizophrenia. Conclusion concern with mental health literacy has led to more studies on lay theories about major mental illnesses (specifically schizophrenia) because these theories reflect societal attitudes to patients and behaviour toward them. This study suggests that even well-educated young people remain ignorant about one of the most challenging mental illnesses.

The aim was to assess the validity of the depressive attributional style proposed by seligman, with a clinically depressed population for negative life events. This study presents a factor analysis of the causal attributions of depressed psychiatric in patients measured in relation to one negative life event per subject. The experimental procedure consisted in asking 71 ward depressed patients (51 females and 20 males) to answer 15 items along a seven point scale in order to assess the causes, consequences and control attributed. Statistical treatment using both multidimensional analyses (to describe the dimensions of causality) and univariate comparisons show: 1. The existence of a three dimensional solution, which is interpreted in terms of seligman's reformulated helplessness model, and which confirms the notion of a ""depressive attributional style"". 2. A positive relationship between intensity of depression and the tendency to generalize the effects of negative life events (dimension of globality in seligman's model and generalizability in beck's). As this relationship is a function of the level of depression it is considered as a psychological state rather than as a personality trait. 3.

Participants of this study were included in a prospective follow-up. Method: 12 months after finishing lsd psychotherapy, 10 participants were tested for anxiety (stai) and participated in a semi-structured interview. A qualitative content analysis (qca) was carried out on the interviews to elaborate about lsd effects and lasting psychological changes. Results: none of the participants reported lasting adverse reactions. The significant benefits as measured with the stai were sustained over a 12-month period. In the qca participants consistently reported insightful, cathartic and interpersonal experiences, accompanied by a reduction in anxiety (77.8\%) and a rise in quality of life (66.7\%). Evaluations of subjective experiences suggest facilitated access to emotions, confrontation of previously unknown anxieties, worries, resources and intense emotional peak experiences a la maslow as major psychological working mechanisms. The experiences created led to a restructuring of the person's emotional trust, situational understanding, habits and world view.

Thus, the aim of the current study was to develop an explanatory model for the effect of endometriosis on women's psychological distress. Furthermore, it sought to further investigate the role of body image, self-criticism, and pain intensity on the psychological distress associated with endometriosis and establish the effect of chronic illness load on the development of this distress.

Different interpretations of results in the past have raised the question of heightened impulsivity as an explanatory model for self-described impulsive behaviour, especially in ocd. Our study included 16 patients with ocd, 14 patients with ts, and 28 healthy control subjects (hc). Self-assessed impulsivity was examined by the barratt impulsiveness scale-11 (bis-11), and the behavioural test used was the immediate and delayed memory task (imt/dmt). Significantly heightened self-assessed impulsivity of the patient collective compared to hc could be observed in in only one dimension: lack of attention (chi(2) (2) = 24.910, p < 0.001). Post-hoc tests were performed using bonferroni adjusted alpha levels of 0.0167 per test (0.05/3) and revealed significantly higher scores in patients with ocd (m = 19.57, sd = 2.82), z = 4.292, p < 0.001 as with ts (m = 19.38, sd = 3.62), z = 3.832, p < 0.001 compared to hc (m = 13.78, sd = 3.18). In patients with ocd, correlations between the dimension of obsessive thoughts with a lack of attention in the form of first-order factor cognitive instability could be shown (n = 14, p = 0.024, r(s) = 0.599) while in patients with ts, tic symptomatology correlated significantly with second-order factor attentional impulsivity (n = 12, p = 0.027, r(s) = 0.635). In behavioural testing, no significant group differences could be observed either in impulsive behaviour (imt: chi(2) (2) = 4.709, p = 0.824; dmt: chi(2) (2) = 0.126, p = 0.939) or in sustained attention (imt: chi(2) (2) = 0.388, p = 0.095; dmt: chi(2) (2) = 0.663, p = 0.718). Heightened impulsivity as an explanatory model for the observed lack of attention, especially in patients with ocd, should be questioned and interpretation biases considered in the future.

39,Testing The Cognitive Catalyst Model With Idiographic Content: Rumination Moderates The Association Between Self-Discrepancies And Depressive Symptoms,VERGARA-LOPEZ C;KYUNG Y;DETSCHNER J,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,,,,,2014,,,"Depressive rumination, which involves repetitive thinking directed at one's depressive symptoms and the perceived causes and consequences of those symptoms, plays an important role in the onset and maintenance of depression. Recently, ciesla, and roberts (2002, 2007; ciesla, felton, \& roberts, 2011) proposed the cognitive catalyst model of depression, which posits that rumination intensifies the impact of already existing negative cognitions. Previous studies examining rumination as a moderator of cognitive content have used nomothetic conceptualizations of cognitive content. The current research replicated and extended these past studies using an idiographic conceptualization of negative cognitive content, specifically self-discrepancy theory (sdt). Sdt suggests that idiographic self-guides serve to direct behavior and govern self-regulation (higgins, 1987). Two studies based on college student samples (n = 102 and n = 107) tested the interaction between rumination and self-discrepancies in the prediction of depressive symptoms. In line with the cognitive catalyst model, study 1 found that rumination moderated the association between actual: ideal self-discrepancies and depressive symptoms, such that self-discrepancies predicted depression more strongly among high compared to low ruminators. Study 2 found that the interaction between rumination and actual: ideal self-discrepancies was specific to predicting dysphoric mood and insomnia versus other dimensions of depressive symptoms, such as lassitude, appetite change and suicidality, and that these effects were limited to males. Results from the two studies provide further support for the cognitive catalyst model by demonstrating that rumination amplifies the association between self-discrepancies and depression and suggests that these effects may be specific to dysphoric mood and insomnia (at least for males) as opposed to other forms of depressive symptomatology.

The aims of this study were to 1) identify types of meanings made about loss, 2) examine socio-demographic and bereavement-related characteristics that might influence meaning making, and 3) investigate associations between types of meanings and post-loss psychological adjustment. Participants were 229 students from an urban commuter university. This was a cross-sectional study, employing self-report data collected on a secure, web-based system. Participants were 18 years or older and had experienced the loss of a friend or family member within the last three years. Bereavement-related meaning making was assessed using four measures of sense-making, cognitive appraisal, religious/spiritual meaning, and impact on identity. Participants were diverse in age (18–61 years, m = 24.18), race (55% white/caucasian, 15.3% asian, 14.4% latino/a, 14.4% black/african american, and 10.4% multi-racial/other), and religious background (25% atheist, 28% agnostic, 53% affiliated with a religion, and 6% spiritual/not religious). The majority lost a family member (66.7%), rather than a friend. Cause of death was due to natural (64.5%) or unnatural/violent causes and the mean time since death was 17.2 months. Principal components analysis identified five interpretable factors of meaning making: 1) personal growth, 2) positive reframing, 3) spiritual/religious meaning, 4) causal attribution, and 5) rumination/impact on identity. After controlling for covariates, each of the factors was regressed onto positive affect (panas), depression (ces-d), posttraumatic stress (pcl-s), and prolonged grief (pgd-13). Results of this study indicated that bereaved students made positive and negative secular and religious meanings about loss. Meaning making factors were influenced by socio-demographic and bereavement-related characteristics, in particular a closer relationship with the deceased, cause of death due to unnatural/violent causes, and younger age of the deceased when he or she died. These characteristics may make it more difficult for survivors to make sense and find meaning in a loss. Difficulty making sense was associated with higher distress, including symptoms of depression, ptsd, and prolonged grief as well as lower positive affect. Future studies are warranted to examine specific cultural influences and the clinical significance of ascribing meaning to loss among underserved groups.

Self-blame and family blame were related to higher ptsd scores, whereas perpetrator blame was not related to ptsd. The strength of the relationship between blame and ptsd score was higher in cases of more severe, isolated, and extrafamilial abuse. The findings suggest that diminishing self-blame attributions may be particularly advantageous in cases of isolated and extrafamilial csa, whereas diminishing family blame would be more advantageous in cases of severe abuse.

Key to this is the estimation of direct effects of treatment and indirect effects acting through intermediate variables which are measured post-randomisation. Using psychological treatment trials as an example of complex interventions, we review statistical methods which crucially evaluate both direct and indirect effects in the presence of hidden confounding between mediator and outcome. We review the historical literature on mediation and moderation of treatment effects. We introduce two methods from within the existing causal inference literature, principal stratification and structural mean models, and demonstrate how these can be applied in a mediation context before discussing approaches and assumptions necessary for attaining identifiability of key parameters of the basic causal model. Assuming that there is modification by baseline covariates of the effect of treatment (i.e. Randomisation) on the mediator (i.e. Covariate by treatment interactions), but no direct effect on the outcome of these treatment by covariate interactions leads to the use of instrumental variable methods. We describe how moderation can occur through post-randomisation variables, and extend the principal stratification approach to multiple group methods with explanatory models nested within the principal strata. We illustrate the new methodology with motivating examples of randomised trials from the mental health literature.",,,NA

Certain differences have been observed among men and women in the perceptions of stoma from the following perspectives: personal control, coherence, emotional impact and impact of the type of causal attribution on depression scores. Our results suggest, for men, that some perceptions of temporary stoma (causes, identity, utility, coherence, emotional impact) are associated with body image, depression and anxiety. This study highlights the need to propose, if perceptions of temporary stoma are perceived as menacing, a psychological counselling to avoid the development of anxious and depressive symptoms and alteration in body image.",,,RECTAL CANCER; TEMPORARY STOMA; PERCEPTION; BODY IMAGE; PSYCHOLOGICAL; DISTRESS
45,"Shame-Proneness And Attribution As Predictors Of Cognitive, Affective, And Behavioral Responses To An Experimental Task",HEYEN A,NA,,,,,1998,,,"This study examined whether shame-proneness and attribution predicted cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes in a controlled experimental situation. The study also examined whether self-reported attributional style mediated the relationship between shame-proneness and theoretically predicted outcomes condition. One hundred thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to conditions and were given either situational or characterological attributions for poor performance on a task involving social judgment and insight. As expected, shame-proneness was positively associated with post test negative mood, negative self-thoughts, and self-reported characterological attributions, and was negatively associated with state self-esteem. Contrary to predictions, self-reported characterological attributions did not mediate the relationship between shame-proneness and outcomes. In addition, the study examined issues related to the construct validity of shame-proneness as a trait-like personality variable. Measures of self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and social desirability were given in order to assess the convergent and divergent validity of several existing measures of shame-proneness. Measures of shame-proneness were related to, but not identical to measures of psychopathology.

In this paper, we have critically reviewed the current health-care structure in the country along with prevailing patterns of health-care service utilization. We have addressed the role of psychiatrists, general practitioners (gps), psychologists, and other health-care personnel in the treatment and care of patients with mdd, with an emphasis on the quality of service provision. In addition, the strengths and weaknesses of primary healthcare (phc), the health insurance system, and inpatient care have been discussed. We have paid attention to the contextual issues such as mental health literacy, stigma, and healthcare inequity where relevant.

49,Does It Matter How We Refer To Individuals With Substance-Related Conditions? A Randomized Study Of Two Commonly Used Terms,KELLY JF;WESTERHOFF CM,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY,,,,,2010,,,"Objective: stigma is a frequently cited barrier to help-seeking for many with substance-related conditions. Common ways of describing individuals with such problems may perpetuate or diminish stigmatizing attitudes yet little research exists to inform this debate. We sought to determine whether referring to an individual as ``a substance abuser'' vs. ``having a substance use disorder'' evokes different judgments about behavioral self-regulation, social threat, and treatment vs. Punishment. Method: a randomized, between-subjects, cross-sectional design was utilized. Participants were asked to read a vignette containing one of the two terms and to rate their agreement with a number of related statements. Clinicians (n = 516) attending two mental health conferences (63\% female, 81\% white, m age 51; 65\% doctoral-level) completed the study (71\% response rate). A likert-scaled questionnaire with three subscales [''perpetrator-punishment'' (alpha =.80); ``social threat'' (alpha = .86); ``victim-treatment'' (alpha = .64)] assessed the perceived causes of the problem, whether the character was a social threat, able to regulate substance use, and should receive therapeutic vs. Punitive action. Results: no differences were detected between groups on the social threat or victim-treatment subscales. However, a difference was detected on the perpetrator-punishment scale. Compared to those in the ``substance use disorder'' condition, those in the ``substance abuser'' condition agreed more with the notion that the character was personally culpable and that punitive measures should be taken. Conclusions: even among highly trained mental health professionals, exposure to these two commonly used terms evokes systematically different judgments. The commonly used ``substance abuser'' term may perpetuate stigmatizing attitudes. (C) 2009 elsevier b.v.

51,The Effect Of Causal Attributions For Depression On Help-Seeking And Treatment Preferences,NOLAN A;O'CONNOR C,JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,,,,,2019,,,"Background: depression is a leading cause of ill-health and disability globally and encouraging help-seeking and treatment engagement is a key priority of health authorities worldwide. Causal attributions for mental illness have numerous attitudinal and behavioural consequences; however, limited research has explored their implications for attitudes to treatment. This study experimentally investigates the impact of causal attributions for depression on attitudes to specific help-seeking and treatment options. Methods: in an online study, 196 participants read a vignette that emphasised either biological, social or biopsychosocial causes of a character's depression. Participants rated several help-seeking and treatment options on how helpful or harmful they would be for the individual described in the vignette and for themselves personally. Results: the causal attribution manipulation significantly affected treatment attitudes. Relative to social attributions, emphasising biological causes of depression significantly decreased the perceived helpfulness of life-style-based treatments, but did not affect attitudes to psychotherapeutic or medical treatment options. Participants rated most help-seeking and treatment options as less helpful for themselves compared to the vignette character. Participants with personal experience of depression had lower confidence in informal sources of help-seeking and greater confidence in medical treatment. Limitations:limitations include reliance on self-report measures and low reliability of certain sub-scales. Conclusions: these findings suggest emphasising the biological underpinnings of depression could deter people from engaging with lifestyle-based treatment options. Promoting biopsychosocial theories of depression could increase awareness about the multifactorial causes of depression without negatively impacting the perceived efficacy of any help-seeking or intervention options.",,,DEPRESSION; CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS; TREATMENT PREFERENCES; HELP-SEEKING;; SURVEY
52,Dynamics Of Inclusion And Exclusion: Comparing Mental Illness Narratives Of Haredi Male Patients And Their Rabbis,GOODMAN Y,CULTURE MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY,,,,,2001,,,"By comparing versions of mental illness narratives - told by haredi (utraorthodox jews) male patients of a mental health clinic in israel and by their rabbis - this paper relates to two distinct, yet interrelated, theoretical questions: the place and agency of narrators, and the tension between experience and representation. A pair of narratives exemplifies a pattern in which the patients (talmudic students) tell a narrative of a sudden breakdown related to a dramatic meeting with a non-human figure (often, a woman) or force. Their rabbis, by contrast, tell a narrative that emphasizes their students' mundane symptoms, ``abnormal'' and ``immoral'' behavior, and use a local adaptation of a western psychological explanatory model. A dynamic of inclusion and exclusion emerges as students are seeking legitimization and avoidance of stigma, while their rabbis are silencing themes that challenge social and cultural orders. The different narratives are further interpreted in the context of the micropolitics of the interviews and of identity politics between the haredim and secular israelis. This social dynamics shows how differently placed social actors-narrators-interpreters construct differently contested and diverse cultural narratives of a seemingly shared reality.",,,HAREDIM; ISRAEL; MENTAL DISORDERS; NARRATIVE ANALYSIS; ULTRAORTHODOX; JEWS

This study examined whether hopeless attributional style mediates this relationship, as well as whether this relationship is moderated by gender, in early adolescents (n = 116, ages 10–14). We assessed two hypotheses: (1) that hopeless attributional style would mediate the relationship between perceived maternal psychological control and anxiety symptoms across 1 year, and (2) that this pathway would be stronger for girls than for boys. This study used a three-wave, prospective longitudinal design. Hopelessness was a significant mediator; early adolescents who perceived high rates of maternal psychological control tended to develop a more hopeless attributional style, which in turn predicted increases in anxiety. This effect was not moderated by gender. We discuss implications for treating and preventing anxiety in youth, specifically the need for interventions to address children’s hopeless attributions and perceptions of parents’ behaviors.

High ee relatives made more attributions about illness than did low ee. Within the high ee group, relatives with marked emotional overinvolvement were similar to the low ee group, with problems attributed to factors more external to and uncontrollable by the patient. Relatives with high criticism gave more causes internal to the patient and hostile relatives also tended to perceive the causes to be controllable by and personal to the sufferers of schizophrenia.

The double blind procedure, when ethically and technically feasible, is a necessary condition for validating results and for causal attribution of the observed difference between the two groups to the tested drug's pharmacological effect.; Comments: in practice, however, it appears that patients and independent investigators can guess who receives the drug and who receives a placebo through side effects, which are usually more frequent in patients receiving the drug. This phenomenon effectively ""breaks the blind"" and represents as such a major methodological bias, which cannot be avoided as it is inseparable of the drug's effect.; Conclusion: the impact of this ""unavoidable"" double blind breach nevertheless remains unclear.

57,Looming Vulnerability To Threat: A Cognitive Paradigm For Anxiety,RISKIND JH,BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY,,,,,1997,,,"The concept that perceived threat or danger is a cognitive antecedent of anxiety is central in clinical psychology, personality psychology, and social psychology. The aim in the current article is to review this concept and present a new conception called the looming vulnerability model. Looming vulnerability is conceptualized as an important cognitive component of threat. Or danger that elicits anxiety, sensitizes the individual to signs of movement and threat, biases cognitive processing, and makes the anxiety more persistent and less likely to habituate. In addition, it is postulated as a principal theme that discriminates anxiety and focal fears from depression. The looming vulnerability model integrates a disparate collection of findings and integrates the conceptualization of anxiety and fear with ethological and developmental observations. The social-cognitive and evolutionary basis of the sense of looming vulnerability are discussed, as well as its roots in cognitive schemata (fear scripts), its state elicitation by several potential classes of antecedent conditions, and possible treatment implications.

Dependent variables were self-efficacy and response efficacy. Independent variables were history of heart disease and current symptoms, current cholesterol level, emotional state, and causal attributions. Overall, levels of perceived personal control (self-efficacy) were moderately high and treatment was perceived to be effective (response efficacy). Predictors were having a lower current cholesterol level, not experiencing symptoms of angina, lower anxiety, lower depression, and perceiving chance as less important and cholesterol as more important in causing a potential heart attack. Thus, previous and current experience together with causal attributions and emotional state are related to perceptions of control over heart disease in at-risk patients.

60,"Social Distance, Stigma, And Help-Seeking: A Comparison Of Lay And Professional Conceptualizations Of Autism In The Southern Us",COURSON CS,NA,,,,,2023,,,"Understanding stigma, help-seeking and barriers to treatment for persons with autism spectrum disorder (asd) is essential for informing interventions toward increased relevance and utility. An array of sociocultural and individual factors can influence lay beliefs and behavioral responses to asd, including stigma and social distancing (i.e., preference for distance from autistic individuals). It is important to consider the explanatory models of asd among helping professionals (e.g., health care, education) as they are likely touchstones along the help-seeking pathway for children with asd. The purpose of this study was twofold: 1) to explore factors in the southern united states associated with different aspects of the em, namely how background factors (demographics), knowledge, and familiarity with asd are related to social distancing, autism stigma, and help-seeking; and 2) to elicit and compare beliefs about asd among groups of lay persons and professionals (i.e., healthcare professionals, teachers) on the frontline of initiating the help-seeking pathway. Quantitative surveys (n = 343) and open-ended data were collected from individuals in the southern united states. Quantitative results indicated: increased knowledge was associated with lower levels of stigma and social distancing; more preference for social distance was associated with decreased help-seeking; more education and asd knowledge were associated with increased help-seeking intentions. Similarly, the data suggests that individuals with higher levels of asd knowledge were more likely to endorse positive attitudes towards help-seeking from professionals. Educators had more asd knowledge than the lay community. However, educators were less likely to seek help from all sources on the measure of general help-seeking (ghsq-v). Qualitative data indicated significant differences between groups in terms of causes and treatment of asd. Educators and healthcare workers more frequently endorsed neurodevelopmental disorders as the cause of asd-like symptoms compared to the lay community. While the lay community and healthcare professionals more frequently recommended psychological treatment, educators were more likely to suggest multiple, specific treatments. Overall, the present study indicated the importance of asd knowledge and how that knowledge impacts each individual's ability and willingness to provide access to the help-seeking pathway.

However, more and more studies are showing that controlled drinking can be a viable alternative for many alcoholics.

As of march 31, 1987, the general directors of 78 of the 81 rehabilitation centers operating in quebec were contacted and interviewed. The data most relevant to the present study came from the response to the following question: ""is a treatment goal other than complete abstinence acceptable for every client who registers in your program to resolve a problem of alcoholism?""

Without effective treatment, such problems are unlikely to resolve. To date, we know very little about how and why parents of children with asd seek help for sleep disturbance. Via an online survey, we gathered information about how parents make sense of their children's sleep problems, beliefs about their causes, sources of information, and help-seeking behavior. The analysis of responses from 244 parents revealed that parents commonly view sleep problems (a) as a consequence of their child's asd, and unlikely to change over time (stable), and (b) as located within the child (intrinsic), stable over time, and difficult to treat. Despite this, parents also rated sleep problems as being important to treat. Eighty-two percent of parents surveyed reported seeking some kind of help for their child's sleep disturbance, and the average parent had tried six different treatment strategies, most commonly medical approaches (e.g. Melatonin). The alignment between parents' treatment choices and those strategies that are supported by research was poor, but belief in the effectiveness of treatments was closely related to how often the treatment was used.

Blood alcohol readings were taken 3 times during the session, and a locus of control scale was administered before and after drinking. For ss in the alcohol conditions, blood alcohol levels averaged .079% before the task and .085% afterwards. Alcohol resulted in higher aggression scores only on the questionnaire measure, and an interaction between drug and attribution was found for the measure of shock duration. Attribution alone resulted in greater aggression on the measure of shock intensity. Ss in groups where the attribution was discrepant with the drug condition were the most aggressive on the measures of shock intensity and duration. These ss became more external, reflecting a high correlation between their aggression and a stimulus tone.

Method. A summary of information collected through electronic (medline, psychlit) and bibliographic research. Results: cbts all broadly attempt to bring a better cognitive, behavioural and emotional adjustment to the psychotic experience by suggesting to the patient a new explanatory model of psychosis: the vulnerability-stress model. These approaches involve different levels and goals. Some focus on correcting basic cognitive deficits or modifying the psychotic symptoms and the related distress. At the other end of the spectrum, metacognitive therapies aim to modify and restructure dysfunctional self and environment schemas to enable the development of better-adjusted and generally applied cognitive strategies. A few studies with limited power and methods have shown the efficiency of those therapies. Conclusion: cbts prove to be a promising additive treatment. They have been shown to improve social adjustment and quality of life, and to diminish psychotic symptoms and the related distress. They address all positive, negative, cognitive, behavioural, and emotional symptoms while considering the stage of the disease and the patient's special needs.

69,Cognitive Predictors Of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Six Months Following Acute Coronary Syndrome.,WIKMAN A;MOLLOY GJ;RANDALL G;STEPTOE A,PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH,,,,,2011,,,"This study examined patients' illness representations assessed shortly after an acute coronary syndrome (acs) as predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms six months later. Illness representations were assessed in acs patients using standard measures at a home visit three weeks after discharge from hospital. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed at the same time, and again six months later. Patients were aged 61 years on average, the majority being men (89.8%) of white european decent (89%). Greater posttraumatic symptoms at six months were associated with beliefs that the illness would last a long time (timeline), that it had an unpredictable time course (timeline--cyclical), greater consequences, less personal and treatment control, poorer illness coherence and stronger negative emotional representations (emotional upset relating to the illness; p < 0.05). In multiple regression analyses, controlling for demographic, clinical and psychological factors (age, gender, ethnicity, social deprivation, acs severity, negative affectivity and cardiac symptom recurrence), more intense emotional representations (ß = 0.146, p = 0.041) and reduced illness coherence (ß = -0.133, p = 0.029), emerged as independent predictors of posttraumatic symptom severity at six months. There was a near significant effect for personal control (ß = -0.113, p = 0.058). These results demonstrate the importance of illness representations of acs in predicting longer-term posttraumatic stress symptoms.",,,COGNITION*; ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME/*PSYCHOLOGY; STRESS DISORDERS; POST-TRAUMATIC/*PHYSIOPATHOLOGY; AGED; FEMALE; HUMANS; INTERVIEWS AS TOPIC; MALE; MIDDLE AGED; REGRESSION ANALYSIS; STRESS DISORDERS; POST-TRAUMATIC/ETIOLOGY; SURVEYS AND QUESTIONNAIRES; UNITED KINGDOM

In order to activate a specific diagnostic category, mental health students completed a test in which half answered questions about victims of rape attacks and half answered questions about the diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder. All ss then rated their attribution for a female interviewee's nonverbal behavior along 4 dimensions: internality, stability, globality, and controllability. Undergraduates in the rape victim condition tended to make more stable and global attributions than did mental health students. Also, ss in the personality disorder condition rated the cause of the interviewee's behavior as significantly more controllable than did ss in the rape victim condition.

Patient's causal beliefs and coping styles may affect symptom appraisal and help-seeking behavior. We examined whether patient's beliefs about the causes of their acs and denial of impact were associated with pre-hospital delay. Pre-hospital delay data were collected from 177 patients with acs. Retrospective causal beliefs and cardiac denial of impact were assessed using questionnaires. Factor analysis of causal beliefs produced 3 factors; beliefs in stress and emotional state, behavioral and clinical risk factors, and in heredity as causal influences. Patients with strong beliefs that stress and emotional state caused their acs were more likely to have long pre-hospital delays (> 130 min). There were no significant associations between pre-hospital delay and the other two causal belief factors. Patients with greater denial scores were also more likely to have long delays than those with low scores. These effects were independent of age, gender, education, previous myocardial infarction, history of depression and negative affectivity. Cognitive and emotional factors including patient's beliefs about causes and avoidant coping help to explain variations in pre-hospital delay.",,,CAUSAL BELIEFS; DENIAL; ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME; PRE-HOSPITAL DELAY

We examined whether beliefs about cause of cancer and prevention of recurrence were associated with health practices and distress in 134 long-term endometrial and cervical cancer survivors. Methods: participants completed questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, health behavior, and beliefs about factors that may have caused their cancer and prevented recurrence. Results: genetics/heredity was rated as the most important cancer cause, followed by stress, god's will, hormones, and environmental factors. Medical screening was rated as most important in preventing recurrence, followed by positive attitude and prayer. Stronger causal attributions were generally associated with elevated depressive symptomatology and anxiety, but women citing potentially controllable causes were more likely to be practicing healthy behaviors. Similarly, women citing health behaviors as important in preventing recurrence reported greater anxiety but were more likely to practice positive health behaviors. Health behavior and lifestyle attributions interacted with health practices in predicting distress. For example, among women who had not made positive dietary changes, rating lifestyle as important in preventing recurrence was associated with greater distress, whereas among women who had made a positive change in diet, this belief was associated with less distress. Conclusions: results suggest that stronger attributions are associated with greater distress, but engaging in behavior believed to be important in preventing cancer or recurrence may ameliorate this distress.",,,ENDOMETRIAL CANCER; CERVICAL CANCER; CANCER SURVIVORS; DISTRESS;; ATTRIBUTIONS; HEALTH PRACTICES

Capacity building, personal growth, reduced/safer drug use, and other positive outcomes may or may not be experienced by pwud involved in engagement activities. Indeed, pwud may also encounter stigma and harm when interacting with healthcare and academic structures. Our objective is to uncover why, how, and under what circumstances positive and negative health outcomes occur during health system engagement by pwud.; Methods: we propose a realist review approach due to its explanatory lens. Through preliminary exploration of literature, lived experience input, and consideration of formal theories, an explanatory model was drafted. The model describes contexts, mechanisms, and health outcomes (e.g., mental health, stable/safer drug use) involved in health system engagement. The explanatory model will be tested against the literature and iteratively refined against formal theories. A participatory lens will also be used, wherein pwud with lived experience of health system engagement will contribute throughout all stages of the review.; Discussion: we believe this is the first realist review to explore the contextual factors and underlying mechanisms of health outcomes for pwud who participate in health system engagement. A thorough understanding of the relevant literature and theoretical underpinnings of this process will offer insights and recommendations to improve the engagement processes of pwud. (© 2022.

An Exploration Of The Effects Of Parental Attributions In An Rct Of Stepping Stones Triple P For The Asd Population,WHITTINGHAM K;SOFRONOFF K;SHEFFIELD J;SANDERS MR,RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS,,,,,2009,,,"This study was conducted in conjunction with a randomised controlled trial of the parenting program stepping stones triple p for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (asds). Fifty-nine families with a child with asd participated. This study focussed upon the role of parental attributions in predicting treatment outcome. Stepping stones altered parental attributions such that following participation in stepping stones parents were significantly less likely to believe that their child’s misbehaviour was caused by factors intrinsic to their child and more likely to believe that their child’s asd-related behaviour may change in the future. Parental attributions before the intervention significantly predicted change in the dysfunctional parenting styles over-reactivity and verbosity throughout the intervention. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of developing a model for the role of parental attributions in predicting treatment outcome.

The objective of this chapter is to address the neuropsychological and behavioral aspects associated with drug use and abuse. For this purpose, it presents and discusses the mechanisms of action of psychotropic substances, focusing on one substance representing each category according to its brain action: alcohol from depressants, cocaine/crack from stimulants, and marijuana from hallucinogen. Later, the main explanatory models on substance use disorders are presented, as well as the clinical interventions for the treatment of substance use disorders that demonstrate some evidence of efficacy and effectiveness.

Our study puts forward an explanatory model of depressive symptoms based on subjective psychological factors in those hospitalized for covid-19 with and without biological markers (i.e., inflammatory markers). Therefore, we aim to evaluate the hypotheses proposed in the model to predict the presence of depressive symptoms. Method we conducted a cross-sectional study, using a simple random sampling. Data from 277 hospitalized patients with covid-19 in lima-peru, were collected to assess mental health variables (i.e., depressive, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and somatic symptoms), self-perception of covid-19 related symptoms, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (nlr) such as inflammatory marker. We performed a structural equation modeling analysis to evaluate a predictive model of depressive symptoms. Results the results showed a prevalence of depressive symptoms (11.2\%), anxiety symptoms (7.9\%), somatic symptoms (2.2\%), and symptoms of post-traumatic stress (6.1\%) in the overall sample. No association was found between the prevalence of these mental health problems among individuals with and without severe inflammatory response. The mental health indicators with the highest prevalence were sleep problems (48\%), low energy (47.7\%), nervousness (48.77\%), worry (47.7\%), irritability (43.7\%) and back pain (52\%) in the overall sample. The model proposed to explain depressive symptoms was able to explain more than 83.7\% of the variance and presented good goodness-of-fit indices. Also, a different performance between the proposed model was found between those with and without severe inflammatory response. This difference was mainly found in the relationship between anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and between the perception of covid-19 related symptoms and somatic symptoms. Conclusions results demonstrated that our model of mental health variables may explain depressive symptoms in hospitalized patients of covid-19 from a third-level hospital in peru. In the model, perception of symptoms influences somatic symptoms, which impact both anxiety symptoms and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Thus, anxiety symptoms could directly influence depressive symptoms or through symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Our findings could be useful to decision-makers for the prevention of depression, used to inform the creation of screening tools (i.e., perception of symptoms, somatic and anxiety symptoms) to identify vulnerable patients to depression.",,,COVID-19; INFLAMMATION; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS; PERU
79,Schizophrenia In The World: Arguments For A Contextual Phenomenology Of Psychopathology,PIENKOS E,JOURNAL OF PHENOMENOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,2020,,,"Traditionally, phenomenological theories of schizophrenia have emphasized disturbances in self-experience, with relatively little acknowledgement of the surrounding world. However, epidemiological research consistently demonstrates a strong relationship between traumatic and stressful life events and the development of schizophrenia, suggesting that encounters in the world are highly relevant for many people diagnosed with this disorder. This paper reviews foundational texts in phenomenology and phenomenological psychopathology on the nature of subjectivity and its disturbances, finding support for broadening contemporary phenomenological models of schizophrenia to incorporate world events and their subjective meaning as essential aspects of this disorder. This contextual approach to phenomenology emphasizes the relationship between self and world, one that is especially unstable, unclear, and untrustworthy in schizophrenia. Both epidemiological and phenomenological research can benefit from this approach: in epidemiology, researchers might consider the ways that various risk factors are experienced by persons vulnerable to schizophrenia, while phenomenologists are encouraged to inquire about the environmental and social context in which altered experiences occur and incorporate these considerations into their explanatory models.

80,Malingered Psychosis,CHESTERMAN LP;TERBECK S;VAUGHAN F,JOURNAL OF FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY \& PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,2008,,,"When forensic psychiatry was developed in the nineteenth century, the detection of malingered psychosis was a central concern. A number of clinical methods were established to facilitate this. However, during the twentieth century interest in the topic waned, apparently due to the erroneous assumption that malingerers fake symptoms to ward off impending psychosis. In the uk, the subject has remained largely ignored. However, in the 1980s there was a resurgence of interest in malingering in the usa among forensic psychiatrists, with the development of instruments that systematised the clinical observations first made during the preceding century. A parallel development in the usa was the development of specific tests designed to elicit evidence of feigned cognitive impairment, first used in head injury cases involving civil litigation. Despite the recognition in the nineteenth century that individuals who feigned psychosis also malingered cognitive impairment, few modern research studies have investigated the incidence of feigned cognitive impairment in those who malinger psychosis, or have applied the instruments designed to detect feigned cognitive deficits to research in this area. Although prevalence data are limited, the available studies indicate that malingered psychosis is not a rare condition, particularly in forensic populations. The authors suggest that the assessment of malingering in forensic settings should always be based on a range of recently developed instruments that evaluate cognitive as well as psychiatric symptoms.",,,FORENSIC; MALINGERING; PSYCHOSIS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT

The purpose of this study was to examine the stigma experiences, explanatory models, unmet needs, preferred interventions and coping mechanisms of caregivers of children with developmental disorders in ethiopia. Methods: participants comprised caregivers (n = 102) of children with developmental disorders attending two child mental health clinics in addis ababa. The majority (66.7 \%; n = 68) had a diagnosis of intellectual disability (id); 34 children (33.3 \%) had autism spectrum disorder (asd) as their primary diagnosis. All caregivers were administered a structured questionnaire via a face-to-face interview, which included an adaptation of the family interview schedule, closed questions about socio-demographic characteristics, explanatory models of illness, type of interventions used or desired and coping strategies, and an open ended question regarding the family's unmet needs. Results: most caregivers reported experience of stigma: 43.1 \% worried about being treated differently, 45.1 \% felt ashamed about their child's condition and 26.7 \% made an effort to keep their child's condition secret. Stigma did not depend on the type of developmental disorder, the child's age or gender, or on the age or level of education of the caregiver (all p > 0.05). Reported stigma was significantly higher in caregivers who had sought traditional help (p < 0.01), provided supernatural explanations for their child's condition (p = .02) and in caregivers of orthodox christian faith (p = .03). Caregivers gave a mixture of biomedical explanations (e.g. Head injury (30.4 \%) or birth complications (25.5 \%)) and supernatural explanations (e.g. Spirit possession (40.2 \%) or sinful act (27.5 \%)) for their child's condition. The biggest reported unmet need was educational provision for their child (74.5 \%), followed by treatment by a health professional (47.1 \%), financial support (30.4 \%) and expert help to support their child's development (27.5 \%). Most caregivers reported that talking to health professionals (86.3 \%) and family (85.3 \%) helped them to cope. Many caregivers also used support from friends (76.5 \%) and prayer (57.8 \%) as coping mechanisms. Conclusions: this study highlights the stigma experienced by families caring for a child with a developmental disorder. Designing interventions appropriate for low-income settings that improve awareness about developmental disorders, decrease stigma, improve access to appropriate education and strengthen caregivers' support are needed.",,,STIGMA; DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; INTELLECTUAL; DISABILITY; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; AFRICA
82,Cope For Asthma: A Cognitive Behavioral Skills-Building Intervention For Children With Asthma And Anxiety,MCGOVERN CM,NA,,,,,2021,,,"Background & purpose: in the united states, asthma affects 6.1 million children and is one of the most common causes of school absenteeism. Asthma is also a major public health issue, accounting for more than $56 billion in annual healthcare costs. Children with asthma are at higher risk of having anxiety/depression and subsequently, higher morbidity and mortality. Few intervention studies have specifically targeted children with asthma and anxiety/depressive symptoms and no scalable school-based interventions are in use. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a school-based, cognitive behavioral skills-building intervention on 8 – 12-year-old children with asthma and anxiety/depression.methods: a one-group, pre/posttest with a 6-week follow-up post intervention was used to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects of creating opportunities for personal empowerment (cope) for asthma on anxiety and depressive symptoms, asthma management self-efficacy, symptom perception, asthma illness representations, controller medication in 8 – 12-year old children with asthma and anxiety/depressive symptoms. Repeated measures anova was used for variables using three time-points, while paired t-tests were used for comparisons using two time-points.results: thirty-two children participated in cope for asthma. Analyses indicated that cope for asthma is feasible for 8 – 12 year-old-children with asthma and anxiety. Significant reductions were found in anxiety, missed doses of the asthma controller medication, and the caregiver completed pediatric symptom checklist, all with moderate to large effect sizes. Significant increases were found in personal beliefs, child-asthma self efficacy, child asthma illness representations, with moderate to large effect sizes.conclusions: cope for asthma is highly feasible for small groups in the school setting and should be tested in a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine the effects when compared to a control group. Cope for asthma could fill a gap in the need for a scalable intervention to improve the health outcomes of children with asthma and anxiety/depressive symptoms.

Aim: the aim of this discussion article is to examine recent research from india on insight and explanatory models in psychosis and re-examine the framework of assessment, diagnosis and management of insight and explanatory models. Methods: recent research from india on insight in psychosis and explanatory models is reviewed. Results: recent research, which has used longitudinal data and adjusted for pretreatment variables, suggests that insight and explanatory models of illness at baseline do not predict course, outcome and treatment response in schizophrenia, which seem to be dependent on the severity and quality of the psychosis. It supports the view that people with psychosis simultaneously hold multiple and contradictory explanatory models of illness, which change over time and with the trajectory of the illness. It suggests that insight, like all explanatory models, is a narrative of the person's reality and a coping strategy to handle with the varied impact of the illness. Conclusion: this article argues that the assessment of insight necessarily involves value entailments, commitments and consequences. It supports a need for a broad-based approach to assess awareness, attribution and action related to mental illness and to acknowledge the role of values and value judgment in the evaluation of insight in psychosis.",,,INSIGHT; EXPLANATORY MODELS; CULTURE; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; PSYCHOSIS; ETHICS

The aim of this research is to investigate possible attitudes of stigmatisation among first and final year medical students registered at the university of conakry faculty of medicine in guinea-conakry (west africa). Methods: focus group discussions identified students' attitudes and perceptions in relation to mental illness, their explanatory models, their opinions concerning traditional and modern therapeutic practices with regard to mental illness, and their interest to possibly incorporate psychiatry in their future medical practice. Results: many students explicitly regret the stigmatisation of mental health patients, but nevertheless share the general population's prevailing attitudes of discrimination. The dominant stereotype of mental illness is that of madness, although final year medical students describe a more diverse spectrum of mental health problems. There is strong adherence to secular occult explanations of mental illness and advocacy for traditional medicine in addressing these illnesses, including among final year medical students. Discussion: no student would opt for psychiatry as a specialisation, although some expressed interest in integrating psychiatry into their future medical practice. However, this research indicates that stigmatising attitudes are not cut in stone.

However, the mechanisms underlying facial emotion perception deficits are poorly understood. There is evidence to suggest that patients, particularly those with certain positive symptoms, may misinterpret other people’s facial expressions as having an overly negative valence. The present study examined the degree to which attribution biases in facial emotion perception are associated with psychiatric symptomatology and social and occupational impairments. Sampling and methods: the error profiles from a facial emotion perception test were analyzed and compared for 67 schizophrenic state hospital inpatients and 21 non psychiatric controls. Attribution bias scores were separately computed for each of six types of emotion. Results: the error profiles were remarkably similar for patients as a group and controls. Within the patient group, severity of positive symptoms was associated with more ‘fear’ misperceptions. Patients with relatively high levels of ‘anger’ misperceptions tended to have more severe disorganization and negative symptoms and more pronounced functional impairments. Interestingly, patients who erroneously reported seeing relatively high levels of ‘shame’ and ‘happiness’ showed better functioning and less severe symptoms. Conclusions: attribution biases appear to play a role in contributing to functional impairments in patients with schizophrenia. The lack of an isomorphic attribution bias across patients highlights the importance of considering schizophrenia heterogeneity when attempting to understand and treat social cognitive deficits.

First, we will briefly provide a context and definitions for relevant terms, such as race, racism, ethnicity, and culture. Concepts and definitions that are typically associated with ethnic minority groups will be briefly discussed and should help the reader to better understand how the terms are being used in this chapter. We will briefly review findings from the u.s. Census to supplement our review with facts and projections about the composition of the u.s. Population, and reflect on two important related concepts, cultural competency and patient-centered care. The second part of the chapter briefly reviews variations in adhd prevalence in the united states by racial/ethnic backgrounds. From a public health perspective, it is critical to know whether prevalence of a given disorder varies by sociodemographic characteristics, in order to be able to assess whether sociodemographic differences in access to care reflect differences in need for care or access disparities. In the third part of the chapter we will review factors relevant to help-seeking and observed disparities in adhd care, such as adhd knowledge, parental explanatory models of adhd, and mental health stigma perceptions.

Results of a path analysis (n = 238) indicate that attribution of cause fully mediated the relations between adherence to asian values and use of coping strategies. Adherence to asian values was positively related to attributing the cause of depression to internal factors, which was in turn associated with greater use of disengagement coping strategies and decreased use of engagement coping strategies. In addition, an internal attribution for the solution to depressive symptoms was related to more reliance on engagement coping strategies and a lower use of disengagement coping strategies.

Aim: to search for a concept that is common to the various theories relating to the aetiology of the syndrome of capgras. Methods: we begin by describing a new case of capgras syndrome that we encountered recently, and thereafter we searched the literature using pubmed and psycinfo. Results: various explanatory models converge in that they all assign a central role to a changed affect. A sensation of ‘alienation’ at a conscious or subconscious level, together with inadequate evaluation of beliefs, seems plausible.

92,Defiant Hospitality: A Grounded Theory Study Of Harm Reduction Psychotherapy,MILET RC;LOPEZ-CASTRO T;LEIBOWITZ A;MCGIRR K;VAKHARIA SP,ADDICTION RESEARCH \& THEORY,,,,,2021,,,"Harm reduction psychotherapy (hrp)is an approach to providing psychotherapy to people who use substances in which abstinence is considered neither a prerequisite to treatment nor its predominant mark of success. There is to date scant empirical research on this clinical approach despite its decades-long practice. Ourstudy aims to spur further investigations by asking:1) what are the basic building blocks of hrp; and (2) what theory might explain how its core strategies are unified?Eight leading hrp proponents and practitioners participated in semi-structured interviews to explore the nature of their work and how they came to it. Through an analysis of the interviewsguided by grounded theory, we propose an explanatory model of hrp as practiced in the u.s. In this model, practitioners, informed by an ethos of defiant hospitality, deploy a variety of therapeutic processes whose combined, complex effects are captured in the phrase making room, which conveys opening up space while simultaneously providing safe enclosure. Making room is operationalized in processes comprising: inviting, meeting at, staying with, holding, reframing substance use, leveraging change from within, supporting agency, and signaling the limits. We discuss the model as deeply informed by its socio-historical roots within treatment spacesthat participants experienced as failing to meet their clients' needs. We also consider hrp'simplications for expanding the reach and capacity of addiction care for the majority of individuals with substance use disorders who may initially be unwilling or unable to abstain. Lastly, we describe its potential for furthering the field's understanding of therapeutic practice with marginalized populations.",,,HARM REDUCTION; SUBSTANCE USE; ADDICTION; GROUNDED THEORY;; PSYCHOTHERAPY; THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE
93,The Hopelessness Theory Of Depression: A Comprehensive Test Of Its Applicability To Elementary School Children,BELL SK,NA,,,,,2001,,,"Hopelessness theory predicts that immediately following a negative event, the impact of the event will predict depressive symptoms, while the interaction of the event and cognitive inferences about cause, self, and consequences of the event will predict distal depressive symptoms. The existing literature supports the utility of this model with adults; however, only a few studies have extended research to children. Far from comprehensive, studies to date have primarily tested the role of causal attribution from hopelessness theory in children, and none have tested the model with elementary children. The current study applied hopelessness theory to 273 students between third and fifth grades. Prior to report cards, a potentially negative event, comprehensive measures of the three key inferences from hopelessness theory were administered. An index to measure children's acceptable grades was also administered, and a grade stress score was calculated when there was a deficit between actual and acceptable grades. Depressive symptoms and negative affect were measured prior to report cards, immediately following report cards, and at one-week follow-up. Consistent with hopelessness theory, grade stress predicted negative affect immediately following report cards. Among children over 11-years-old, the interaction between inferences about self and grade stress predicted distal depression as well; however, the direction of the interaction was not consistent with the prediction of the theory. This study also compares sex differences in attributions to sex differences in depressive symptoms and negative affect. While boys reported more negative attributions, girls reported higher levels of depression and negative affect. Results are discussed in light of previous literature.

94,Construct Validation Of Chronic Sorrow In Mothers Of Children With Chronic Illness,DUNNING EJ,NA,,,,,2000,,,"Researchers have described similarities in parental long-term affective responses to childhood chronic illness and have termed the response 'chronic sorrow.' Chronic sorrow has been described as a set of specific negative affects. The psychological dimensions of chronic sorrow have not been adequately examined. Few studies of families of children with chronic illness have used a comparison group. A cross-sectional, two-group design was used to examine the differences between the identified variables for mothers of children with a chronic versus an acute illness. A goal of this study was to validate the construct of chronic sorrow. Data were collected from mothers who attended an urban, pediatric, tertiary care setting. Mothers were randomly selected from a variety of outpatient clinics. The two groups consisted of 82 mothers who had a child diagnosed with a chronic illness and a comparison group of 68 mothers of children who had an acute health problem ameliorated with a minor surgical intervention. It was hypothesized that mothers of children who were diagnosed with a chronic illness would report significantly higher levels of fear, anger, frustration, sadness and helplessness and would not report higher levels of hopelessness or depression than would the mothers of children who had an acute health problem. Multivariate analysis of variance and covariance detected no differences on any of the dependent variables for either illness group even when the model included factors that may have confounded the results. The study also investigated whether some combination of affect would discriminate mothers of children with chronic versus acute illness. Logistic regression did not result in a significant model and accounted for an overall prediction success rate of 55% for illness group membership. A principle components analysis did not support the hypothesized relationships among the affects associated with chronic sorrow. Several possible methodologic, and theoretical explanations for the findings were posited. The findings suggest that the construct of chronic sorrow does not exist as defined by the presence of fear, frustration, anger, sadness, and helplessness. The process of adaptation to childhood chronic illness is complex and explanatory models require a systems perspective and an ecological framework.

Researchers assume that personality traits and behaviors toward which people hold strong attitudes evoke evaluative reactions. Such reactions influence the importance of these attributes as they are integrated with other information during the formation of social judgments and, in part, account for the accentuation effect. Social judgment was studied in the context of professional-impairment impressions provided by nurses. Data were modeled using hierarchical techniques to examine the interaction between within-judge differences in attribute weighting and between-judges differences in attitudes. Social judgments of fictitious targets were moderated by individual differences in judges' attitudes toward negative target attributes; some, but not all, attributes were accentuated as predicted.

Reliable and valid assessment of ems may be hindered by interviewer and respondent disparities on certain demographic characteristics, such as ethnicity. The present study examined (a) whether ethnic minority patients reported different ems to ethnically similar interviewers in comparison with those with a different ethnicity, and (b) whether this effect was related to respondents' social desirability, the perceived rapport with the interviewer and level of uncertainty toward their ems. A total of 55 patients of turkish and moroccan origins with mood and anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to ethnically similar or dissimilar interviewers. Ems were assessed, using a semi-structured interview, across 11 different categories of causes. Participants who were interviewed by an ethnically similar interviewer perceived interpersonal, victimization and religious/mystical causes as more important, whereas interviews by ethnically dissimilar interviewers generated higher scores on medical causes. These effects were not mediated by the perceived rapport with the interviewer, and social desirability had a modest impact on the results. Higher uncertainty among participants toward medical and religious/mystical causes seemed to be associated with greater adjustment in the report of these ems. The findings have significant implications for interviewer selection in epidemiological research and clinical practice.",,,EXPLANATORY MODELS; MENTAL ILLNESS; INTERVIEWER EFFECT; MATCH EFFECT;; ETHNIC MINORITIES

Difficulties in processing emotional states are implicated in the aetiology and maintenance of diverse health conditions, including anorexia nervosa (an) and chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs). This study sought to explore distress tolerance, self-silencing, and beliefs regarding the experience and expression of emotions in individuals diagnosed with an and cfs. These conditions were chosen for this study because their clinical presentation is characterized by physical symptoms, yet cognitive behavioural models suggest that emotional processing difficulties contribute to the aetiology and maintenance of both. Design. A between-subjects cross-sectional design was employed. Methods. Forty people with an, 45 with cfs, and 48 healthy controls (hcs) completed the distress tolerance scale (dts), silencing the self scale (stss), beliefs about emotions scale (bes), and measures of clinical symptomatology. Results. Initial group comparisons found that both an and cfs participants scored higher than hcs on a subscale measuring difficulties in distress tolerance. An and cfs participants were also more likely to judge themselves by external standards, endorse statements reflecting a tendency to put the needs of others before themselves, and present an outwardly socially compliant image of themselves whilst feeling hostile within. Relative to hcs, an participants reported more maladaptive beliefs regarding the experience of having negative thoughts and feelings and revealing these emotions to others, with cfs participants showing a non-significant trend in the same direction. After controlling for differences in age, anxiety, and depression the only significant difference to remain was that observed for the stss care as self-sacrifice subscale. More maladaptive beliefs about the experience and expression of emotions were associated with greater degree of eating disorder symptomatology in the an group. Conclusions. Differences in emotional processing are present in an and cfs compared to hcs, with some disorder-specific variation, and may be associated with greater clinical symptomatology. These findings support current explanatory models of both an and cfs, and suggest that emotional processing should be addressed in the assessment and treatment of individuals with these illnesses.",,,NA

Yet, the role of anxiety in heart disease has not received as much attention in the literature as has depression. Epidemiologic studies indicate that there is an increased risk of sudden death and myocardial infarction in patients experiencing panic anxiety. Pathophysiologic correlates of anxiety appear to contribute to an increased cardiac risk, leading to the appreciation that anxiety disorders might in fact constitute a risk to life as exemplified by the cardiovascular disease link. Explanatory mechanisms of cardiac risk point to a link between anxiety and heart disease being mediated by stress giving way to increased cardiac sensitivity and reactivity. The present chapter reviews the psychobiological link between anxiety and heart disease. It also supports an integrative approach for the analysis of psychogenic heart disease, that cardiac patients can benefit from cardiologists educating them about the influence of psychosocial factors on their cardiac conditions and that further research is required on the development of specific psychologically based therapies which tap into the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the mind-heart nexus.

Instead, due to historical misconceptions, gout is typically seen as a lifestyle disease caused by poor diet. In reality, there are a number of risk factors that contribute to gout, including genetic factors. Views of gout as precipitated by lifestyle alone can lead to stigma, and maladaptive beliefs that it should be treated primarily through dietary changes. This is thought to contribute to poor uptake of, and adherence to, effective pharmaceutical treatments. Gout has some of the poorest medication adherence rates of any chronic disease, contributing to suboptimal health outcomes for patients. Recent research suggests that when gout is referred to as `urate crystal arthritis' (a rarely used name for gout), the perception of the disease by members of the public was more accurate. It was viewed as being less under personal control (i.e. Less appropriately managed by behaviours such as dietary intake), and more appropriately managed by long-term medical treatment. This finding raises the possibility that patients themselves might also benefit from gout being explicitly labelled as arthritis. Indeed, parallels can be drawn between this case and other diseases that have recently had their names changed to improve outcomes, namely primary biliary cirrhosis and schizophrenia. A movement away from the term gout may benefit those living with the disease by changing illness perceptions and increasing uptake of, and adherence to, guideline-recommended treatment(s).",,,GOUT; URATE-LOWERING THERAPY; ALLOPURINOL; NAME CHANGE; URATE CRYSTAL; ARTHRITIS; TREATMENT ADHERENCE

104,Social Cognitive Biases And Deficits In Aggressive Boys,DODGE KA;FRAME CL,CHILD DEVELOPMENT,,,,,1982,,,"Three studies assessed the nature and limits of a known bias on the part of aggressive boys to overattribute hostile intentions to peers. Study 1 with 81 aggressive kindergarten through 5th graders and matched nonaggressive ss determined that this bias was restricted to attributions of a peer's behavior toward an aggressive s and not to attributions of a peer's behavior toward a 2nd peer. Biased attributions were implicated as a direct precedent to aggressive responses. Study 2 with 80 of the same ss assessed the role of selective attention to and recall of hostile social cues in the formation of a biased attribution. It was found that selective recall of hostile cues did lead to a biased attribution, but that selective recall did not fully account for the attributional differences between aggressive and nonaggressive ss. Specific deficits in recall by aggressive ss were identified. Study 3 with 48 2nd graders involved observation of the peer-directed aggressive behaviors of ss in a controlled setting. It was found that the biased attributions of aggressive ss may have some basis in their experience, in that they were frequently the targets of peers' aggressive behavior. Their own aggressive behavior toward peers, however, occurred at a much higher rate than the rate at which they were the targets of aggression. Findings lead to the formation of a social-information-processing model of aggressive behavior.

It is important to notice that secure attachment is likely to be some kind of prevention of psychopathology and insecure attachment has increasingly been utilized as a powerful explanatory model for psychopathology. However, recently there is more research on the associations between attachment styles and depression to investigate related potential mediation in order to increase our understanding of the underlying processes involved. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of self-esteem on adult attachment and the interaction of depressiveness. The subjects of the study were 139 men and women (97 (69.8 %) women and 42 (30.2 %) men). The mean age of the subjects was 39.58 ± 10.97. Method: these methods were used for investigation: multi—item measure of adult attachment or the experiences in close relationships scale (ecr) (brennan et al., 1998); zung depression inventory, (zung et al., 1965); and the rosenberg self-esteem scale (rosenberg, 1965). Results: the results of this study showed that most participants are disorganized attached 33.1 %, dismissing type—26.6 %, and finally, save and preoccupied types—20.1 %. The results also show that the individuals with the lowest self-esteem are the disordered attached participants. The most depressed are disordered attached and those who have low self-esteem. We have found that self esteem has an influence on depressiveness and attachment bonds. Self esteem explains 34.7 % of depressiveness and attachment connection. Conclusion: the results of the study showed that save attached subjects are least depressed and have higher self esteem. Self-esteem of subjects is mediator of attachment and depressiveness connection.

This study aims at assessing cross-cultural differences in the reporting of alcohol-related adverse consequences. It also considers differences across consequences that might explain which type of consequences (mainly acute or mainly chronic) are most affected by an attribution process. Methods: conditional regression models were estimated based on data from eight european countries participating in the gender, alcohol and culture—an international study (genacis) project. Cases were matched to controls based on usual drinking patterns in order to control for average volume of alcohol and frequency of ‘risky single occasion drinking’ (rsod). Results: differences among the patterns of associations between countries and consequences were evident. The distinction between nordic and other european countries was persistent. A higher variability of associations was observed for some consequences, namely the mainly acute instances. Finally, the isle of man and switzerland showed specific trends with associations across consequences. Conclusion: reporting of alcohol-related adverse consequences seemed strongly affected by cultural norms. The latter may be exemplified by viewing drinking as ‘time-out’ behavior. Respondents in countries with a stereotypical history of being ‘dry’ or with a stereotyped ‘binge’ drinking culture were more likely to attribute consequences to their alcohol consumption than people in ‘wet’ countries. This was particularly true for consequences that related to episodic ‘time-out’ heavy drinking.

These were general ratings of vulnerability to two diseases (heart disease and cancer) versus the respondents' estimates of their perceived cause of death. Results showed that a large percentage (48%) of the sample did not feel particularly vulnerable to a disease. These participants thought they would live longer than the rest of the sample, were less hypochondriacal, and worried less about getting cancer. Heart disease was selected as the perceived cause of death by 22% of the sample, while cancer was selected by 20% of the sample. Family history of the respective disease was a major predictor of the perceived cause of death. Antecedents of perceived risk were found to be disease-specific, which was demonstrated by the disease-die measure. Risk mechanisms for heart disease included conservation of energy as you get older based on the attitudes that the disease is not preventable and that it is common among friends, relatives, and the general population. Attitudes toward both heart disease and cancer, along with predicted age at death, influenced perceived vulnerability to cancer. Standard measures of personality were largely mediated by cognitive and attitudinal measures and anxiety. The results favored a reality-based representation of disease threat as opposed to a more emotionally-driven one.

110,The Promise Of Layer-Specific Neuroimaging For Testing Predictive Coding Theories Of Psychosis,HAARSMA J;KOK P;BROWNING M,SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH,,,,,2022,,,"Predictive coding potentially provides an explanatory model for understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms of psychosis. It proposes that cognitive processes, such as perception and inference, are implemented by a hierarchical system, with the influence of each level being a function of the estimated precision of beliefs at that level. However, predictive coding models of psychosis are insufficiently constrained-any phenomenon can be explained in multiple ways by postulating different changes to precision at different levels of processing. One reason for the lack of constraint in these models is that the core processes are thought to be implemented by the function of specific cortical layers, and the technology to measure layer specific neural activity in humans has until recently been lacking. As a result, our ability to constrain the models with empirical data has been limited. In this review we provide a brief overview of predictive processing models of psychosis and then describe the potential for newly developed, layer specific neuroimaging techniques to test and thus constrain these models. We conclude by discussing the most promising avenues for this research as well as the technical and conceptual challenges which may limit its application. (C) 2020 the authors.

In study 3, primes of death led to greater attributions of blame to victims of circumstance but did not influence attributions of blame to victims who were explicitly responsible for their condition. In study 4, innocent victims who were severely injured elicited more death-related cognitions than did victims who were responsible for their condition or who were only mildly injured.

116,Factors Contributing To The Long-Term Adjustment Of College Women Abused As Children,AUGUSTO KW,NA,,,,,1995,,,"The current study examines psychological correlates of childhood maltreatment, including adult attachment, attributional style, perceived family environment, and current social support and demonstrates their main effects and interactions for predicting long-term psychological distress. Further, this study expands upon past research by broadly defining childhood maltreatment, to include sexual, physical, and psychological aspects of maltreatment. This perspective enables the examination of abuse main effects as well as the interactional effect of the various types of abuse. Three hundred and twenty college women completed the family experiences survey, conflict tactics scale, childhood maltreatment interview-revised, social support questionnaire, insecure attachment inventory, bell object relations reality testing inventory, mental health inventory, and brief symptom inventory. One hundred and twenty eight women reported a history of maltreatment. Multiple regressions and a discriminant analysis showed attributional style, attachment, and specific maltreatment experiences significantly contributed to the prediction of psychological distress in adulthood. A significant interaction was noted for psychological abuse and attributional style. Further, the unique combinations of specific maltreatment experiences significantly predicted differences in paranoia and depression in the group of maltreated women.

Many disorders are often comorbidly expressed in diverse combinations. In clinical practice comorbidity and multimorbidity are underrecognized, underdiagnosed, underestimated and undertreated. So that one can speak about comorbidity and multimorbidity anosognosia. Comorbidities and multimorbidities are indifferent to medical specializations, so the integrative and complementary medicine is an imperative in the both education and practice. Shifting the paradigm from vertical/mono-morbid interventions to comorbidity and multimorbidity approaches enhances effectiveness and efficiency of human resources utilization. Comorbidity and multimorbidity studies have been expected to be an impetus to research on the validity of current diagnostic systems as well as on establishing more effective and efficient treatment including individualized and personalized pharmacotherapy.",,,COMORBIDITY; MULTIMORBIDITY; EXPLANATORY MODELS; INDIVIDUALIZED AND; PERSON-CENTERED MEDICINE

Of the baseline sample (n = 255), 134 provided both full baseline and follow-up data on measures of interest. We determined associations between patients' follow-up scores on the headache impact test-6 and baseline characteristics (including headache impact and frequency scores, mood, attributions about psychological/medical causes of their headaches, satisfaction with gp care and illness perceptions). Greater impact and stronger beliefs about the negative consequences of headaches at baseline were the strongest predictors of poor outcome at follow-up.",,,HEADACHE; IMPACT; OUTCOME; GENERAL PRACTICE; ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS
119,Cultural Issues And Trauma,OSTERMAN JE;DE JONG JTVM;FRIEDMAN MJ;KEANE TM;RESICK PA,HANDBOOK OF PTSD: SCIENCE AND PRACTICE.,,,,,2007,,,"Traumatic events are, unfortunately, ubiquitous human experiences that affect people from diverse cultural groups across the globe. Clinicians and researchers typically work with individuals, families, and communities that differ from their own cultural groups. Cultural competency skills are essential to either effectively treat or research any medical condition, and especially psychiatric disorders, because of the interplay between culture and concepts of health or illness, expressions of distress, and healing beliefs and practices. These broad concepts cross the fields of anthropology, psychiatry, and psychology. Across all disease and illnesses (medical and psychiatric), culture determines the local expression of symptoms (idioms of distress, illness behavior), illness attributions (explanatory models), coping, locally sanctioned treatments, as well as, acceptance of treatments, both western and non-western. The vast diversity of cultural and subcultural groups creates barriers to knowledge of all cultures and subcultures. However, a clinician or researcher can develop cultural competency by applying core concepts. This chapter presents several core concepts in cultural medicine and current methodology in mental health treatment and research to provide the reader with an approach to cultural issues. Brief examples from a variety of cultures around the world are used to illustrate some of these core concepts. Current literature pertaining to psychological trauma is reviewed, and its generalizability is discussed. Future directions for research to increase our knowledge of the interplay between culture and the impact of traumatic events are presented.

Disease/disability parameters, including duration of disease and age of disease onset, were examined to determine their relation to attributional style and psychopathology. Attributional style was an efficient predictor of the youths' self-reports of depressive symptoms, when controlling for demographic and disease-related variables. Disease onset was related to children's self-reports of depressive symptoms. Teachers rated youth with scss as exhibiting more internalizing behavior.

Suicidal ideation (si) is associated with childhood trauma, personality, dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms, but how they interact to predict si remains unclear. Methods: using cross-sectional design and convenience sampling method, a survey was conducted among 565 college students having major depressive disorder (mdd). The childhood trauma questionnaire, eysenck personality questionnaire, dysfunctional attitudes scale and hamilton depression scale assessed participants' psychosocial factors. Chi-square test, t-test, pearson correlation, and structural equation model were used in data analysis. Results: overall, 66.02\% of participants with mdd had si. Those with si showed significant differences in physical abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, psychoticism, neuroticism, extroversion, dysfunctional attitudes and depressive symptoms compared with those without si. Childhood trauma, psychoticism, neuroticism, extroversion and dysfunctional attitudes affected si through chain mediation. In addition, depressive symptoms, psychoticism, neuroticism and extroversion directly affected si. Limitations: the convenience sampling method may limit the generalizability of the findings.

123,A Pilot Intervention Targeting Attribution Style And Rigidity Following Traumatic Event Exposure,JOSEPH JS;GRAY MJ,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,,,,,2014,,,"Efforts to regain a sense of safety and security following a highly distressing life event are commonly observed. The attribution process is one such effort that has been studied extensively in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd). The content of causal explanations often receives attention as a risk factor for ptsd, even though there is some disagreement regarding what constitutes a harmful attribution. Recently, degree of flexibility in generating causal explanations has been examined as well. Prevention and intervention efforts targeting explanatory style and flexibility for depression populations have found success. However, this approach has yet to be evaluated among ptsd populations. Randomized assignment to immediate treatment or a delayed treatment control group was used to provide information about the efficacy of attribution retraining. Intervention resulted in significant alterations in causal attributions that were associated with large decreases in ptsd symptoms. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are presented and discussed.",,,POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER; ATTRIBUTIONS; COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY

Yet, research on parental beliefs about disease causation is still scarce. While a small number of studies assesses parental cause attributions for singular disorders (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorders), no study has compared disorders with differing physical versus mental conditions or with mixed comorbidities in children and adolescents or their caregivers. Furthermore, most pediatric research suffers from a lack of data on fathers. Objective hence, the objective of the current study was to test for possible differences in mothers' and fathers' perceptions about the etiology of their child's illness. Methods forty-two parent couples (overall n = 84) whose child had been diagnosed either with attention deficit hyperactivity-disorder (adhd) or autism spectrum disorder (asd) (category ``neurodevelopmental disorder'') or with a primary physical illness and a comorbid mental disorder, e.g. Depression (category ``psychosomatic disorder'') were asked to rate possible causes of their child's illness using a modified version of the revised illness perception questionnaire (ipq) cause scale. Results a two-way anova showed that psychosomatic disorders were significantly more strongly attributed to be caused by medical and environmental stressors than neurodevelopmental disorders. A significant parent x illness category interaction revealed that this effect was more pronounced in fathers. Conclusions by providing first insights into parental beliefs about the etiology of their children's neurodevelopmental versus psychosomatic disorders, this study paves ground for future research and tailored counseling of affected families.",,,CHILDREN; ILLNESS CAUSE; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER; PARENTAL; PERSPECTIVES; PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDER

The authors examined attributions 55 primary care physicians and 315 senior medical students make toward substance abusers. Half of both groups expressed negative causal attributions, with women slightly less negative than men. Mental models showed that higher negative attributions by both physicians and students were related to their increased authoritarianism and depressed mood. Medical students choosing careers in primary care specialties, including psychiatry, expressed a less negative attributional style toward substance abusers than those students entering non-primary careers. Health professional educators may find that using attribution theory to redefine successful outcomes in management of substance abuse can result in better attitudes for caregivers.

Although relatively uncommon, this kind of side effect is observed in a growing number of cases and mostly occurs in patients who do not have a history of bipolar disorder. Several dozen cases have been reported showing the onset of manic symptoms after taking antibiotics. The antibiotic most frequently involved is clarithromycin. Clinical case. - we report the case of a 61 -year-old patient who presented a manic episode after taking an antibiotic combination to treat helicobacter pylori. Five days after the start of highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart), behavioral problems appeared (aggressiveness, irritability, talkativeness, insomnia). At the time of hospitalization, she had an acute delusional symptomatology, with a theme of persecution, associated with intuitive, interpretive and imaginative mechanisms. Manic symptoms were obvious: psychomotor excitement, aggressiveness and irritability, flight of ideas, verbal disinhibition and a denial of problems. There was no toxic cause. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) was normal. Her condition improved very quickly and delusions disappeared in four days. Mrs. H. Could critic her delirium and recovered a euthymic state. During hospitalization, treatment divalproate sodium was introduced (250 mg, 3 times a day), was maintained following hospital discharge for 2 years for prevention, and then decreased to the stop. There are currently no further behavioral problems or sleep disorders two years after this episode. Discussion. - facing this clinical case, several questions arise: which drug therapy is the most suitable for this type of mental disorder? Are there predictors of antibiomania? Is there a risk of recurrence of mood episodes following an antibiomania that occurs spontaneously? What are the pathophysiological mechanisms that could explain this reaction? In all cases identified, stopping the antibiotics was decisive. However, the introduction of a psychotropic and the duration of this treatment remain unclear. First, longitudinal follow-up would assess this variable. Second, it is unclear whether the presence of personal psychiatric history is a predictor of antibiomania. Finally, there are several hypotheses to explain antibiomania: the competitive effect of gabaergic inhibitory receptors, seizure-like phenomena that mimic psychiatric symptoms, and disruption of the intestinal microbiota by antibiotics leading to a modification of the functioning of the central nervous system. The explanatory model of antibiomania is not yet known and requires further research. (C) 2016 l'encephale, paris.",,,MANIC EPISODE; ANTIBIOTICS; HELICOBACTER PYLORI
130,The Relationship Of Attribution Of Responsibility To Acute Stress Disorder Among Hospitalized Burn Patients,LAMBERT JF;DIFEDE JA;CONTRADA RJ,JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE,,,,,2004,,,"Attribution of responsibility for a traumatic event has been related to subsequent adjustment. Self-blame has been associated with better adjustment in some cases and worse in others, whereas other-blame has consistently been associated with poorer outcomes. This study assessed the relationship between attribution of responsibility and acute stress disorder (asd) in burn victims. Hospitalized burn patients (n = 124) underwent psychological assessment within 2 weeks of their burn injury. Participants were categorized as reporting self-blame (n = 49), other-blame (n = 36), both (n = 10), or neither (tv = 29). Twenty-three percent of those with other-blame were diagnosed with asd, compared with 0% of those with self-blame. Self-blame and other-blame also were related to asd in logistic regression analyses controlling for demographic and medical variables. With both types of blame in the same model, self-blame was significantly associated with lower rates of asd, whereas other-blame was related to higher rates, but this did not reach significance. When analyzed in separate models, both of these relationships attained statistical significance. These findings have implications for identifying and treating people at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder after exposure to trauma.

133,Do Patients Think Cannabis Causes Schizophrenia? - A Qualitative Study On The Causal Beliefs Of Cannabis Using Patients With Schizophrenia,BUADZE A;STOHLER R;SCHULZE B;SCHAUB M;LIEBRENZ M,HARM REDUCTION JOURNAL,,,,,2010,,,"Background: there has been a considerable amount of debate among the research community whether cannabis use may cause schizophrenia and whether cannabis use of patients with schizophrenia is associated with earlier and more frequent relapses. Considering that studies exploring patients' view on controversial topics have contributed to our understanding of important clinical issues, it is surprising how little these views have been explored to add to our understanding of the link between cannabis and psychosis. The present study was designed to elucidate whether patients with schizophrenia who use cannabis believe that its use has caused their schizophrenia and to explore these patients other beliefs and perceptions about the effects of the drug. Methods: we recruited ten consecutive patients fulfilling criteria for paranoid schizophrenia and for a harmful use of/dependence from cannabis (icd-10 f20.0 + f12.1 or f12.2) from the in- and outpatient clinic of the psychiatric university hospital zurich. They were interviewed using qualitative methodology. Furthermore, information on amount, frequency, and effects of use was obtained. A grounded theory approach to data analysis was taken to evaluate findings. Results: none of the patients described a causal link between the use of cannabis and their schizophrenia. Disease models included upbringing under difficult circumstances (5) or use of substances other than cannabis (e. G. Hallucinogens, 3). Two patients gave other reasons. Four patients considered cannabis a therapeutic aid and reported that positive effects (reduction of anxiety and tension) prevailed over its possible disadvantages (exacerbation of positive symptoms). Conclusions: patients with schizophrenia did not establish a causal link between schizophrenia and the use of cannabis. We suggest that clinicians consider our findings in their work with patients suffering from these co-occurring disorders. Withholding treatment or excluding patients from certain treatment settings like day-care facilities or in patient care because of their use of cannabis, may cause additional harm to this already heavily burdened patient group.",,,NA

Previously, we demonstrated the protective role of parental responsiveness for reducing the risk of exposure-related disruptive behavior in adolescence. Here, we expanded this line of inquiry, examining whether responsiveness moderates the relation of pte to a broader set of behavioral disinhibition features in early childhood and testing alternative diathesis-stress versus differential susceptibility explanatory models. Pte was assessed prospectively using interviews and bioassays in the midwestern infant development study (mids). Mother-child dyads (n = 276) were re-assessed at approximately 5 years of age in a preschool follow-up. We quantified maternal responsiveness and child behavioral disinhibition using a combination of directly observed activities in the lab and developmentally sensitive questionnaires. Results supported a diathesis-stress pattern. Children with pte and less responsive mothers showed increased disruptive behavior and lower effortful control compared with children without pte. In contrast, exposed children with more responsive mothers had self-regulatory profiles similar to their non-exposed peers. We did not observe sex differences. Findings provide greater specification of the protective role of maternal responsiveness for self-regulation in children with pte and help clarify mechanisms that may underscore trajectories of exposure-related behavioral disinhibition.",,,MATERNAL BEHAVIOR*; MOTHER-CHILD RELATIONS*; PRENATAL EXPOSURE DELAYED EFFECTS*; PROBLEM BEHAVIOR*; TOBACCO SMOKING*; CHILD DEVELOPMENT; CHILD; PRESCHOOL; FEMALE; HUMANS; INFANT; INHIBITION; PSYCHOLOGICAL; MALE; MOTHERS; PREGNANCY; DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; PARENTING; PRENATAL TOBACCO EXPOSURE; SELF-REGULATION

137,The Effect Of Diagnostic Labelling On The Lay Theory Regarding Schizophrenic Disorders,ANGERMEYER MC;MATSCHINGER H,SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY: THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN SOCIAL AND GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES,,,,,1996,,,"Tested hypotheses about the diagnostic labelling (dl) effect on lay beliefs regarding schizophrenic disorders. From a representative survey conducted among 1,022 german citizens (at least 18 yrs old and living in private households), results show that labelling a disorder discussed in a clinical vignette as schizophrenia increased the probability that biological factors were considered etiologically relevant while psychosocial stress was noted less frequently as a cause. Therefore, dl may cause lay-etiological beliefs to theories held by psychiatric experts. The afflicted persons and their parents were also less frequently held responsible for the onset of the disorder. However, it is argued that caution should be taken in the diagnosis of schizophrenia as this was assessed less favorably with dl. Thus, these results do not represent a definite argument either for or against the explicit diagnosing of schizophrenia.

138,A Qualitative Analysis Of Explanatory Models In Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms Presenting To A Tertiary Health Care Psychiatric Facility In South India,MENON V;SHANMUGANATHAN B;ARUN AB;THAMIZH JS;SELVAKUMAR S,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY,,,,,2016,,,"Background: knowledge about subjective perceptions and explanatory models has the potential to inform clinical evaluation and lead to development of patient-friendly treatment models in medically unexplained physical symptoms (mups). Aim: to collect qualitative data about explanatory models in mups. Methods: a cross-sectional observational study was done among patients with mups presenting over a 2-year period to a specialty psychosomatic clinic. The short explanatory model of illness interview was used to gather qualitative data about explanatory models which were subsequently recoded using standard manuals. Results: a total of 123 subjects were evaluated. The nature of symptoms was most commonly reported as non-specific' (n=102, 82.9\%) but of moderate to severe intensity (n=87, 73.8\%). Getting cured or showing improvement was the most common expectation from treatment (n=58, 47.9\%). Moderate to severe impact of symptoms was reported on work output (n=100, 84\%), emotional life (n=85, 71.4\%) and physical mobility (n=59, 49.1\%). A considerable proportion was either dissatisfied (n=61, 50\%) or frankly unhappy (n=38, 31.4\%) with treatment received. Conclusion: there is a need to re-calibrate the clinical approach to people with mups to enhance treatment satisfaction. Our findings could assist in evolving culturally sensitive conceptualizations of illness and in developing patient-centred models for therapy in mups patients.",,,MEDICALLY UNEXPLAINED SYMPTOMS; EXPLANATORY MODELS; QUALITATIVE; RESEARCH; SOMATOFORM DISORDER; SOMATIZATION; PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS
139,Diabetes Screening Anxiety And Beliefs,SKINNER TC;DAVIES MJ;FAROOQI AM;JARVIS J;TRINGHAM JR;KHUNTI K,DIABETIC MEDICINE,,,,,2005,,,"Aims this study assesses the impact of screening for diabetes on anxiety levels in an ethnically mixed population in the uk, and explores whether beliefs about type 2 diabetes account for these anxiety levels. Methods this cross-sectional study recruited individuals who were identified at high risk of developing diabetes through general practitioners' (gps) lists or through public media recruitment. Participants completed an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt). Between blood tests, participants completed the spielberger state anxiety scale short form, the emotional stability scale of the big five inventory 44 and three scales from the diabetes illness representations questionnaire, revised for this study. Results of the 1339 who completed the ogtt and questionnaire booklet, 54\% were female, with 21\% from an asian background. Forty-five per cent of participants reported little to moderate amounts of anxiety at screening (mean 35.2; sd = 11.6). There was no significant effect of family history of diabetes, ethnic group or recruitment method on anxiety. The only variable significantly associated (negatively) with anxiety was the personality trait of emotional stability. Of responders, 64\% and 61\% agreed that diabetes was caused by diet or hereditary factors, respectively. Only 155 individuals (12\%) agreed that diabetes was serious, shortens life and causes complications. Conclusions the results of this study replicate that of previous studies, indicating that screening for diabetes does not induce significant anxiety. Bivariate analysis indicated that individuals who perceived diabetes to be serious, life shortening and resulting in complications had higher anxiety scores, the personality trait of emotional stability being the strongest predictor of anxiety.",,,ANXIETY; BELIEFS; IMPACT; SCREENING; TYPE 2 DIABETES

Structural equation modeling revealed only moderate support for the model, explaining low to moderate levels of variance in global sexual risk taking. The amount of explained variance improved when age was included as a predictor in the model. Findings shed light on the contribution of aids information, motivation, and behavioral skills to risky sexual behavior among teens receiving outpatient psychiatric care. Results suggest that cognitive and behavioral factors alone may not explain sexual risk taking among teens whose cognitive and emotional deficits (e.g., impaired judgment, poor reality testing, affect dysregulation) interfere with hiv preventive behavior. The most powerful explanatory model will likely include a combination of cognitive, behavioral, developmental, social (e.g., family), and personal (e.g., psychopathology) risk mechanisms.",,,ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY*; COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY*; HIV INFECTIONS/*PREVENTION & CONTROL; ADOLESCENT; ADOLESCENT BEHAVIOR; CHILD; HUMANS; MODELS; PSYCHOLOGICAL; MOTIVATION; RISK ASSESSMENT/METHODS; SAFE SEX; UNITED STATES

Patients and methods aya cancer survivors (n = 167) and controls (n = 170), recruited during visits to a cancer survivorship clinic and primary care, completed self-report questionnaires of distress, health problems, and health beliefs. For survivors, providers rated treatment intensity and health problems. Results there were no statistically significant differences between survivors and controls in psychological distress or hrqol. Cancer survivors had less positive health beliefs. Survivors diagnosed as adolescents had significantly greater psychological distress and fewer positive health beliefs than those diagnosed earlier. Survivors with the highest level of treatment intensity had greater anxiety and fewer positive health beliefs than those with less intense treatments. Provider report of current health problems related to survivors' beliefs and mental hrqol only, whereas patient report of health problems correlated significantly with most psychosocial outcomes and beliefs. Conclusion aya cancer survivors did not differ from peers in psychological adjustment but did endorse less adaptive health beliefs. Survivors diagnosed during adolescence and who had more intensive cancer treatments evidenced poorer psychosocial outcomes. Beliefs about health may be identified and targeted for intervention to improve quality of life, particularly when patient perceptions of current health problems are considered.",,,ADOLESCENT BEHAVIOR*; HEALTH BEHAVIOR*; HEALTH KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; PRACTICE*; PSYCHOLOGY; ADOLESCENT*; NEOPLASMS/*MORTALITY; NEOPLASMS/*PSYCHOLOGY; SURVIVORS/*PSYCHOLOGY; ADAPTATION; PSYCHOLOGICAL; ADOLESCENT; ADULT; AGE FACTORS; ANXIETY/ETIOLOGY; CASE-CONTROL STUDIES; CULTURE; DEPRESSION/ETIOLOGY; DRUG THERAPY/PSYCHOLOGY; FEMALE; HUMANS; MALE; PERCEPTION; QUALITY OF LIFE; RADIOTHERAPY/PSYCHOLOGY; RISK ASSESSMENT; RISK FACTORS; STRESS; PSYCHOLOGICAL/ETIOLOGY; SURGICAL PROCEDURES; OPERATIVE/PSYCHOLOGY; SURVEYS AND QUESTIONNAIRES; YOUNG ADULT

To measure hnc patients' perception of shame and stigma, the shame and stigma scale (sss) was developed and preliminarily validated. In this study, we aimed to translate, adapt, and validate the sss in chinese. Methods: this study consisted of a cross-sectional design with consecutive sampling and consisted of two stages: (1) translation of the sss into chinese by two bilingual professionals and (2) examination of the chinese version of the sss (c-sss) for internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and concurrent validity. In total, 159 inpatients with hnc (mean age: 56.8 years, 95\% males) were enrolled at a medical center in southern taiwan. Results: the principal component analysis of the c-sss revealed a five-factor structure: 4 of the 5 factors were replicated in the original sss, including shame with appearance, regret, social/speech concern, and sense of stigma; only factor 4, self-discrimination, was newly identified in the current study. C-sss showed acceptable internal validity (cronbach's alpha = 0.85), test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and fair concurrent validity with the taiwanese depression questionnaire (tdq), hamilton depression rating scale (ham-d), hamilton anxiety rating scale (ham-a), and explanatory model interview catalogue (emic). Conclusion: the findings of this study indicate that c-sss is a reliable and valid instrument for evaluating hnc patients' perception of shame and stigma in the taiwanese population.",,,HEAD AND NECK CANCER; SHAME; STIGMA; ASSESSMENT; PSYCHOMETRIC
143,An Attributional Analysis And The Adjustment Of Women Exposed To Sexual Abuse As Children,CALLAHAN EA,NA,,,,,1998,,,"This study examined the relationship between attributions, severity of abuse, and adjustment in women sexually abused as children. General attributional style was measured by the attributional style questionnaire. In order to measure both characterological and behavioral attributions related to the abuse, the sexual abuse attribution questionnaire was used. Three types of adjustment were measured: depression, anger, and overall maladjustment. Depression was measured by the beck depression inventory and the trauma symptom checklist. Anger was measured by the multidimensional anger inventory and the trauma symptom checklist. Maladjustment was measured by the trauma symptom checklist. Participants in the study were 70 women who were sexually abused as children who responded to ads in the local paper and word of mouth information. The results of this study indicated that attributional style and attributions related to the abuse are important predictors of depression, anger, and general maladjustment. Specifically, a global and stable attributional style for negative events was related to high levels of depression, anger, and maladjustment. Internal attributions for negative events were related to both high levels of depression and anger. An analysis of the abuse related attributions revealed that any type of attribution of blame toward the mother, either characterological or behavioral, was related to depression, anger, and maladjustment. However, for attributions of blame toward the perpetrator or the child only characterological attributions were related to anger, depression, and maladjustment. This suggests that behavioral attributions of blame toward the perpetrator or the child are healthier than characterological attributions. This finding has important implications for the treatment of women sexually abused as children.

144,Perception In Young Adult Romantic Relationships: A Latent Profile Analysis Of Trait Mindfulness In Relation To Attachment And Attributions,KIMMES JG,NA,,,,,2017,,,"Perceptions regarding the causes and intentions behind partner transgressions are often just as important as the transgressions themselves. Although mindfulness-based interventions have been useful in clinical work with couples, the potential role that mindfulness plays in attributions is unclear. Using a sample of 542 young adults in romantic relationships, i explored the direct and indirect associations among attachment, trait mindfulness, and attributions. Specifically, i conducted a latent profile analysis, a person-centered approach, through which i identified four latent classes of trait mindfulness, including a high mindfulness class, a nonjudgmentally aware class, a low mindfulness class, and a judgmentally observing class. I then ran a path analysis and found a number of significant direct effects. For example, relative to membership in the low mindfulness, membership in the high mindfulness class and the nonjudgmentally aware class were associated with more benign attributions. I also found two significant indirect effects. First, heightened attachment anxiety was associated with an decreased probability of being nonjudgmentally aware class relative to the low mindfulness class, which was inversely linked with benign attributions. Second, avoidant attachment was linked with a decreased probability of membership in the high mindfulness class relative to the low mindfulness class, which was linked to a decrease in benign attributions. The clinical implications and areas for future research based on the findings of this study are discussed.

Eating disorder books and popular magazines have offered a variety of ways in which individuals can communicatively influence bulimics to seek the help they need to treat their disorder. Unfortunately, many of the recommended influence strategies have been atheoretically derived and sorely lack empirical data affirming their effectiveness. The present study investigates and empirically tests the effectiveness of interpersonal intervention messages aimed at getting bulimic individuals to seek medical help. Several theoretical perspectives, as they relate to messages of threat and efficacy, were used to predict the effects of bulimics' threat and efficacy perceptions on message acceptance and message rejection. A main and positive effect for efficacy was found on message acceptance. A threat by efficacy interaction on message acceptance was partially supported for both cognitive and behavioral message acceptance. The threat by efficacy interaction was not significant for message rejection. Overall, this study confirmed the notion that high levels of both threat and efficacy are necessary to convince bulimic individuals to seek help. These findings can be used to aid concerned individuals in their quest to intervene and to get bulimics to seek out the necessary medical assistance and support.",,,BULIMIA; BULIMIA INTERVENTIONS; INTERPERSONAL INFLUENCE; THREAT;; EFFICACY

Ss were 246 mothers and their 7–9 yr old sons. Mothers' and sons' attributions about one another's intent were significantly related to the aggressiveness of the behavior that each of them directed toward the other. Boys' earlier aggression did not significantly predict the mothers' subsequent attributions, whereas mothers' negative behavior indeed predicted subsequent negative attributions on the part of the boys. Even after considering children's earlier negative behavior, children's negative attributions about their mothers helped explain the aggressiveness of their subsequent behavior. The same was not true for mothers whose earlier attributions indirectly influenced their subsequent aggressive behavior.

The current paper investigated why the non-participants were reluctant to participate in genetic testing. Methods: sixty six eligible individuals, who were knowledgeable about the test but had not participated in genetic testing by january 2003, completed a self-report questionnaire assessing motivation, anxiety, family dynamics, risk knowledge and causal attributions. Results: non-participants reported anxiety levels below clinical significance. A principal components analysis on reasons for non-participation distinguished two underlying motives: emotional and rational motivation. Rational motivation for non-participation was associated with more accurate risk knowledge, the inclination to preselect mutation carriers within the family and lower scores on anxiety. Emotional motivation for non-participation was associated with disease misperceptions, hesitation to communicate unfavourable test results within the family and higher scores on anxiety. Conclusion: rational and emotional motivation for non-participation in the genetic test for hereditary melanoma was found. Emotionally motivated individuals may be reluctant to disseminate genetic risk information. Rationally motivated individuals were better informed than emotionally motivated individuals. It is suggested that a leaflet is added to the invitation letter to enhance informed decision-making about genetic testing.

148,Assessing Patient Beliefs In A Clinical Trial Of Hypericum Perforatum In Major Depression,BANN CM;PARKER CB;BRADWEJN J;DAVIDSON JRT;VITIELLO B;GADDE KM,DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY,,,,,2004,,,"Little is known about the beliefs of patients suffering from major depression as to the causes of their illness and effective treatments. This study introduces a new instrument for capturing these beliefs, the explanatory model for depression (emd) questionnaire, and explores the beliefs of patients participating in a clinical trial of an alternative medicine, hypericum perforatum. Although the emd was originally conceptualized as having five factors pertaining to models of the illness and treatment approaches, the data suggest that patient beliefs are aligned on two factors pertaining to internal and external locus of control. Strong beliefs on either of the emd locus of control subscales are associated with more severe depression. More importantly, strong beliefs on the external locus of control subscale are associated with less improvement over the 8-week period of observation. These results support the role of patients' beliefs in their recovery from depression and suggest that patients who believe the causes of their depression are outside of their control are less likely to improve over time. It is important to note that beliefs did not mediate the effect of treatment on depression in this study, perhaps because patients were blinded to their treatment condition. Future studies should explore whether patient beliefs have an even greater impact when patients are aware of the treatment they are receiving and can determine whether that treatment is consistent with their beliefs.

149,"Earthquakes, Attributions, And Psychopathology: A Study In A Rural Community",MASSAZZA A;JOFFE H;BREWIN CR,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY,,,,,2019,,,"Background: attributions of both cause and blame form part of the diagnostic criteria for ptsd in dsm-5. Most work on attributions and psychopathology has focused on survivors of interpersonal violence and the two types of attribution have not been investigated together in natural disaster contexts. Previous work has identified that attributions to god's role may be associated with survivors' mental health following disasters. We studied the relation between attributions to god and other actors/entities in a rural community with high levels of religiosity that had suffered extensive damage and loss of life due to a series of earthquakes. Methods: a sample of survivors (n = 127) was assessed for degree of earthquake exposure, resource loss, attributions of cause and blame for the earthquake damage, and psychopathology three months after a series of major earthquakes in italy. Results: nature and chance were associated with higher cause than blame attributions whereas the state, the municipality, building firms, and the mafia were associated with higher blame than cause attributions. Additionally, both cause and blame attributions towards god and chance were positively correlated with ptsd and psychological distress symptoms. These associations remained significant while controlling for degree of earthquake exposure, resource loss, gender, age, and education. Conclusion: the current study supports the role played by cognitions about the cause of traumatic events, as introduced into the ptsd diagnosis in dsm-5, and extends this to blame of other entities such as god and chance following disasters.",,,DISASTER SURVIVORS; POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;; ATTRIBUTIONS; BLAME; CAUSE
150,Recovery Benefits Of The ``Therapeutic Alliance'' Among 12-Step Mutual-Help Organization Attendees And Their Sponsors,KELLY JF;GREENE MC;BERGMAN BG,DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE,,,,,2016,,,"Background: the ``therapeutic alliance'' between clinicians and patients has been associated with treatment response and outcomes in professionally-delivered psychotherapies. Although 12-step mutual help organizations (mhos), such as alcoholics anonymous, are the most commonly sought source of support for individuals with substance use disorder (sud), little is known about whether a stronger alliance in comparable mho relationships between 12-step sponsors and those they help (''sponsees'') confers benefits similar to those observed in professional contexts. Greater knowledge could inform clinical recommendations and enhance models that explain how individuals benefit from 12-step mhos. Method: young adults (n = 302) enrolled in a prospective, clinical effectiveness study of residential sud treatment were assessed at treatment entry, and 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge on whether they had a sponsor, contact with a sponsor, and degree of sponsor alliance. Hierarchical linear models (hlm) tested their effects on 12-step mho attendance, involvement, and percent days abstinent (pda). Results: approximately two-thirds of the sample (n = 208, 68.87\%) reported having a sponsor at one or more follow-up time points. Both having sponsor contact and stronger sponsor alliance were significantly associated with greater 12-step participation and abstinence, on average, during follow-up. Interaction results revealed that more sponsor contact was associated with increasingly higher 12-step participation whereas stronger sponsor alliance was associated with increasingly greater abstinence. Conclusions: similar to the professional-clinical realm, the ``therapeutic alliance'' among sponsees and their sponsors predicts better substance use outcomes and may help augment explanatory models estimating effects of mhos in sud recovery.

151,Unholy Questions About Five Central Tenets Of Psychoanalysis That Need To Be Empirically Verified,LUYTEN P,PSYCHOANALYTIC INQUIRY,,,,,2015,,,"Psychoanalysis is about asking the hard questions. This article applies this basic assumption of the clinical practice of psychoanalysis to the science of psychoanalysis. I focus on a number of key assumptions of psychoanalytic approaches and their epistemological status: (a) the theoretical language of psychoanalysis, (b) psychoanalytic technique and training, (c) psychoanalytic developmental theories, (d) object relational and attachment approaches within psychoanalysis, and (e) the nature of general explanatory models in psychoanalysis. These examples are far from exhaustive, but cover a broad set of historical and contemporary theoretical approaches within psychoanalysis. In asking ``hard'' questions about the epistemological status of these key assumptions, i emphasize the importance of the re-introduction of playfulness and the cherishment of novelty and innovation, so important for psychological development, in psychoanalytic thinking. Psychoanalysis, as any other scientific discipline, should not shy away from asking these hard questions. It should do so with frank openness and a playful attitude. If not, orthodoxy and rigidity, already widespread in some quarters within psychoanalysis, will lead to a degenerative program of research that will herald the downfall of psychoanalysis as an intellectual and clinical movement.",,,NA
152,Evaluation Of Malingering And Related Response Styles,ROGERS R;BENDER SD;OTTO RK;WEINER IB,"HANDBOOK OF PSYCHOLOGY: FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY., VOL. 11, 2ND ED.",,,,,2013,,,"Clinical and forensic assessments are highly dependent on openness and accuracy of examinees' responding. For many psychological tests, the validity of test findings is predicated on sincere and sustained efforts. As a result, clinical conclusions are vulnerable to response styles, including both intentional and unintentional distortions. External influences on self-reporting and effort may include the adversarial effects of litigation and pressures exerted by interested others, such as attorneys and family members. Internal influences may include: (a) reactions to questioned credibility, (b) stigmatization of mental disorders or disability status, (c) effects of a genuine disorder, or (d) purposeful efforts to obtain undeserved benefits. Psychologists tend to focus on (d) as it relates to external goals that can be achieved through malingering, defensiveness, and denial. In contrast, they deemphasize other internal and external influences. For example, we are unable to find any empirical studies on how questioned credibility in disability cases may affect the overstating or understating of psychological impairment. Psychologists may wish to openly address internal and external influences that potentially arise from their evaluations. As part of the informed consent process, they may choose to ask examinees about their understanding of the purposes of the evaluation and what they have been told about the evaluation by others, recognizing that some disclosures may be covered by attorney-client privilege. Disclosures from the forensic psychologist about the purpose of the evaluation and his or her role may allay some of the examinee's concerns about partisanship (e.g., being 'hired gun' for the insurance company). Especially in civil cases, an unhurried and respectful discussion of the evaluation, its purpose, and parameters is often needed to address strong negative reactions regarding perceived coercion (e.g., 'i had to come') or questioned credibility (e.g., 'you wouldn't keep probing, unless you think i am lying'). Tests of cognitive abilities and achievement are premised on optimal effort by examinees. Less than optimal effort may vitiate the accuracy of test results and lead to concerns about deliberate under-performance. An important consideration is the effect of comorbid disorders on test performance. This section provides an overview of response styles with a summary of accepted terminology. Three general perspectives of malingering are explicated. Explanatory models are reviewed with a discussion of inferred motivations for why persons engage in malingering. In addition, misassumptions about response styles are examined in the context of forensic evaluations. (Psycinfo database record (c) 2022 apa, all rights reserved)",,,NA

Imprecision of the corollary discharge in schizophrenia may contribute to the misperception of inner experiences and thoughts as 'voices' or auditory hallucinations. Objectives: to assess the precision of the forward model in schizophrenia using the n100 component of the auditory event-related potential to speech that is altered or unaltered, in real time, as it is being spoken. To assess the relationship between auditory hallucinations and the imprecision of the corollary discharge. Design: prospective case-control study. Setting: community mental health centers and palo alto veterans affairs health care system, palo alto, calif. Participants: twenty patients with schizophrenia and 17 sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects. Main outcome measures: n100 responses to auditory feedback, which was altered by pitch-shifting the self-voice, substituting an alien voice, or pitch-shifting the alien voice. On each trial, subjects judged whether feedback was 'self,' 'other,' or 'unsure.' Clinical ratings were used to assess severity of auditory hallucinations in patients. Results: in controls, n100 to unaltered self-voice feedback was dampened relative to n100 to altered self-voice or alien auditory feedback. This pattern was not seen in hallucinating patients. This imprecision correlated with the severity of hallucinations and with the percentage of misattribution errors. Conclusion: these data support a connection between auditory verbal hallucinations and the imprecision of the corollary discharge heralding the sensory consequences of thoughts and actions.

We hypothesized that individuals tend to favor causal explanations that match the event in terms of size and scope. In experiment 1, the magnitude of the consequences of events was manipulated, and participants were presented with two potential causes of modest magnitude and two potential causes of high magnitude. Analyses revealed a relative magnitude-matching effect such that participants were more likely to select high magnitude causes for large magnitude events than modest magnitude events and more likely to select modest magnitude causes for modest magnitude events than large magnitude events. Experiment 2 replicated the magnitude-matching effect with a different event and set of causes, and demonstrated that this effect could be reversed by undermining participants' beliefs in the magnitude-matching principle.

In the schizophrenic ss, the test was administered after inducing either lexical meaning (lm) or inducing personal meaning (pm). Results indicate that there was more pathology among ss after lm than after pm. After pm, blunted effect increased in schizophrenic ss and acting out increased in normal ss. It is concluded that, in schizophrenic ss, pm led to enhanced pathology and, in normals, led to loosening of habitual controls.
