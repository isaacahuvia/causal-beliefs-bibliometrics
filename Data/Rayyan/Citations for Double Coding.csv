1,PERCEPTION ET VÉCU DE LA MALADIE SOMATIQUE SELON LES FORMES CLINIQUES DE SCHIZOPHRÉNIE = PERCEPTION AND EXPERIENCE OF PHYSICAL ILLNESS BY CLINICAL FORMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA,DE CAUSSADE LM,ANNALES MÉDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES,,,,,2013,,,"STUDIES ABOUT SCHIZOPHRENIC SOMATIC HEALTH ARE NUMEROUS AND TEND TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS A CURRENT ISSUE AT STAKE IN CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH. UNLIKE COMMON POPULATION, VARIOUS COMORBIDITY AND EXCESS DEATH RATE CHARACTERIZED SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. MOREOVER, THEIR SOMATIC CARE SEEMS NOT CONCERNED BY HEALTH SYSTEM. WE WONDER IF THIS PROBLEM OF SOMATIC HEALTH OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS IS DUE TO THEIR PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION OR THE CARE SYSTEM THAT SEEMS DIVIDED BETWEEN SUPPORT FOR SOMATIC AND PSYCHIATRIC. THE AIM OF OUR WORK IS THE STUDY OF PSYCHIC MECHANISMS AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL FACTORS UNDERLYING THE DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGEMENT OF SOMATIC COMORBIDITY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS. IN ORDER TO STUDY THE CARE OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS, WE CONDUCTED TEN SEMI-DIRECTIVE INTERVIEWS WITH VOLUNTEER SCHIZOPHRENIC INPATIENTS. BASED ON PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS, WE REALIZED THAT ACCORDING TO THE CLINICAL FORM OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, THE CONCEPT OF PHYSICAL ILLNESS AND HIS CONSCIENCE SEEMED DIFFERENT. SO WE DECIDED TO DIVIDE THE PATIENTS IN TWO GROUPS. THE FIRST GROUP INCLUDES THE PATIENTS WITH POSITIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY SUCH AS NON-SYSTEMATIZED DELIRIOUS IDEAS AND UNMOTIVATED LAUGHTER. THE SECOND GROUP INCLUDES PATIENTS WITH NEGATIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY SUCH AS AUTISM AND EMOTIONAL DISORDERS. WE FOCUSED ON INSIGHT OR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOMATIC DISEASE AND ITS CARE BY THE HEALTH SYSTEM. REGARDING POSITIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY PATIENTS, WE NOTED THE ASSIGNMENT OF A CAUSE OUTSIDE THEIR PHYSICAL ILLNESS AND AN ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SOMATIC DISEASE. THIS ALTERATION OF INSIGHT IS THE RESULT OF SOME FEATURES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, PARTICULARLY DISSOCIATION AND ITS EFFECTS ON THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS AS WELL AS PARANOID DELUSIONS AND ITS IMPACT ON THE PERCEPTION OF REALITY. IN ADDITION, PHYSICAL ILLNESS CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO DELIRIUM BY INTERPRETATIVE MECHANISMS OR COENESTHETIC HALLUCINATORY MECHANISMS. THIS RESULTS IN A DELUSIONAL INTERPRETATION OF SOMATIC SYMPTOMS, A PERCEPTION OF COENESTHETIC HALLUCINATIONS AS SOMATIC SYMPTOMS AND A DENIAL OF PHYSICAL ILLNESS. THEREFORE, THESE PATIENTS ADOPT A PASSIVE BEHAVIOUR THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM AN ADAPTED CARE, ACTIVE ATTITUDES NOT ADAPTED TO THE DISEASE AND EVENTUALLY; THEY ARE POORLY ATTENDED CONCERNING SOMATOLOGIC ASPECT. THEY ARE OFTEN AFRAID TO CONFRONT THE DISEASE AND HAVE A NEGATIVE REPRESENTATION, SOMETIMES DELIRIOUS, OF MEDICAL CARE. NATURALLY, THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCEPTING TO RECEIVE SUCH MEDICAL CARE, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED. VERY FEW HAVE A REGULAR MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP. ON THE OTHER HAND, NEGATIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY PATIENTS HAVE PREDOMINANTLY A PRESERVED INSIGHT AND EASILY CARED FOR SOMATIC DISEASE. THE PRESERVATION OF THIS ABILITY ALLOWS SOME INSIGHT INTO THE CAUSE OF THE PATIENTS OF THEIR DISEASE. HOWEVER, SOME SHOW A LIVED WITHOUT AFFECT OF PHYSICAL ILLNESS THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF AN EMOTIONAL DETACHMENT AS A RESULT OF DISSOCIATION. THE PRESERVATION OF INSIGHT ALSO FACILITATES THE ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICAL CARE AND ACCEPTS MEDICAL FOLLOW MORE EASILY. OUR STUDY INTENDS TO DEMONSTRATE THE VARIOUS PERCEPTIONS OF SOMATIC DISEASES ACCORDING TO THE SYMPTOMATOLOGY OF PATIENT. THIS STUDY LEADS US TO THE IDEA THAT THE LINK BETWEEN PSYCHE AND SOMA HAS REPERCUSSIONS ON THE REPRESENTATION AND THE PERCEPTION OF THE SOMATIC DISEASE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENT. IN PRACTICAL, THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LINK BETWEEN BODY AND PSYCHISM ASKS THE QUESTION OF THE WAY OF TAKING CARE OF PATIENT AT ALL LEVELS INCLUDING THE SOMATIC ONE.

2,BEYOND DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS: A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF POLISH CATHOLIC WOMEN REPORTING DEMONIC POSSESSION,PIETKIEWICZ IJ;KLOSINSKA U;TOMALSKI O,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA \& DISSOCIATION,,,,,2021,,,"THERE IS A GAP IN RESEARCH EXPLORING THE EXPERIENCES AND EXPLANATORY MODELS OF PEOPLE LABELLED IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS POSSESSED. WHILE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTS OFTEN FOCUSED ON THE LINKS BETWEEN POSSESSION AND DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS OR PSYCHOSIS, THE CURRENT STUDY ELABORATES ON PROBLEMS ATTRIBUTED TO POSSESSION IN WOMEN WITH FEATURES OF PERSONALITY DISORDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE EIGHT POLISH ROMAN CATHOLIC WOMEN WHO HAD FREQUENTED DELIVERANCE MINISTRIES OR INDIVIDUAL EXORCISMS BECAUSE THEY WERE PERCEIVED AS SUFFERING FROM MALIGNANT POSSESSION. FOLLOWING CLINICAL ASSESSMENT, VIDEO-RECORDED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS ABOUT POSSESSION EXPERIENCES WERE TRANSCRIBED AND SUBJECTED TO INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. PARTICIPANTS TALKED ABOUT: (1) DIFFICULTIES WITH EXPRESSING EMOTIONS AND NEEDS; (2) AVERSION TO THE CHURCH AND ITS PEOPLE; (3) CASTING SPIRITS OUT; AND (4) NEGOTIATING EXPLANATORY MODELS AND SEEKING HELP. DATA SHOWS THAT THE NOTION OF POSSESSION CAN JUSTIFY UNACCEPTED CONFLICTS AND IMPULSES ASSOCIATED WITH ANGER, SEXUALITY, AND ATTACHMENT NEEDS IN WOMEN WITH PERSONALITY DISORDERS. ENDORSEMENT OF, AND IDENTIFICATION WITH THIS BELIEF CAN PREVENT PEOPLE FROM TAKING OWNERSHIP OF EMOTIONS AND USING PROFESSIONAL TREATMENT. ALONGSIDE SPIRITUAL COUNSELLING, PRIESTS INVOLVED SHOULD HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF MENTAL DISORDERS AND ENCOURAGE THE USE OF CLINICAL CONSULTATIONS.

3,INDIRECT EFFECTS OF ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE FOR POSITIVE EVENTS ON DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS THROUGH SELF-ESTEEM DURING EARLY ADOLESCENCE,RUEGER SY;GEORGE R,JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE,,,,,2017,,,"RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION HAS OVERWHELMINGLY FOCUSED ON RISK FACTORS, SUCH AS STRESSFUL NEGATIVE EVENTS AND COGNITIVE VULNERABILITIES, BUT MUCH IMPORTANT INFORMATION CAN BE GAINED BY FOCUSING ON PROTECTIVE FACTORS. THUS, THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO BROADEN UNDERSTANDING ON ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION BY CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF TWO POSITIVE ELEMENTS AS PROTECTIVE FACTORS, ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE FOR POSITIVE EVENTS AND SELF-ESTEEM, IN A MODEL OF DEPRESSION. THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 491 MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS (52 % FEMALE; N = 249) WITH AN AGE RANGE FROM 12 TO 15 YEARS (M = 13.2, SD = .70). THE SAMPLE WAS ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE, WITH 55 % WHITE, 22 % HISPANIC, 10 % ASIAN AMERICAN, 3 % AFRICAN AMERICAN, AND 10 % BIRACIAL/OTHER. CORRELATIONAL ANALYSES INDICATED SIGNIFICANT CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN AN ENHANCING ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE (INTERNAL, STABLE, GLOBAL ATTRIBUTIONS FOR POSITIVE EVENTS), SELF-ESTEEM AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. FURTHER, PROSPECTIVE ANALYSES USING BOOTSTRAPPING METHODOLOGY DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT INDIRECT EFFECTS OF AN ENHANCING ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE ON DECREASES IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS THROUGH ITS EFFECTS ON SELF-ESTEEM. THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE FOR POSITIVE EVENTS AS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL COURSE OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS DURING EARLY ADOLESCENCE.

METHODS: AN ETHNOMETHODOLOGICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING KLEINMAN'S EXPLANATORY MODEL INTERVIEW GUIDE TO EXPLORE THE PERCEPTIONS OF DETAINED YOUNG PEOPLE IN NEED OF MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. FINDINGS: FIVE THEMES WERE EXTRACTED FROM FOCUS GROUPS, INDICATING LACK OF CONTROL IN THEIR LIVES AND LACK OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED FEELINGS OF HOPELESSNESS AND DEPRESSION, THEY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS BETTER TO BE TOUGH THAN TO BE SICK.

FIRST, WE WILL BRIEFLY PROVIDE A CONTEXT AND DEFINITIONS FOR RELEVANT TERMS, SUCH AS RACE, RACISM, ETHNICITY, AND CULTURE. CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS THAT ARE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS WILL BE BRIEFLY DISCUSSED AND SHOULD HELP THE READER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE TERMS ARE BEING USED IN THIS CHAPTER. WE WILL BRIEFLY REVIEW FINDINGS FROM THE U.S. CENSUS TO SUPPLEMENT OUR REVIEW WITH FACTS AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE U.S. POPULATION, AND REFLECT ON TWO IMPORTANT RELATED CONCEPTS, CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND PATIENT-CENTERED CARE. THE SECOND PART OF THE CHAPTER BRIEFLY REVIEWS VARIATIONS IN ADHD PREVALENCE IN THE UNITED STATES BY RACIAL/ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS. FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE, IT IS CRITICAL TO KNOW WHETHER PREVALENCE OF A GIVEN DISORDER VARIES BY SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHETHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS TO CARE REFLECT DIFFERENCES IN NEED FOR CARE OR ACCESS DISPARITIES. IN THE THIRD PART OF THE CHAPTER WE WILL REVIEW FACTORS RELEVANT TO HELP-SEEKING AND OBSERVED DISPARITIES IN ADHD CARE, SUCH AS ADHD KNOWLEDGE, PARENTAL EXPLANATORY MODELS OF ADHD, AND MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA PERCEPTIONS.

6,AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF PUBLIC SPEAKING ANXIETY AND AUDIENCE FAMILIARITY,BAUCOM JA,NA,,,,,1995,,,"THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC SPEAKING ANXIETY (PSA) AND AUDIENCE FAMILIARITY, SPEAKERS' ATTRIBUTIONS REGARDING THE AUDIENCE, AND SPEAKERS' PERCEPTIONS OF FAMILY OF ORIGIN. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM TOASTMASTERS INTERNATIONAL, AN ORGANIZATION DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTION AND PRACTICE IN THE BASIC TECHNIQUES OF PUBLIC SPEAKING. A TOTAL OF 107 MEMBERS, 66 MALES, AND 41 FEMALES, PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE PUBLIC SPEAKING INVENTORY WHICH CONSISTS OF FIVE INSTRUMENTS: THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION SHEET; THE AUDIENCE FAMILIARITY SCALE, A FIVE-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPED TO ASSESS ANXIETY ABOUT SPEAKING BEFORE AUDIENCES OF DIFFERING DEGREES OF FAMILIARITY; THE AUDIENCE EXPLORATION SCALE, A SEVEN-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPED TO EXPLORE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS WHEN IMAGINING SPEAKING BEFORE AUDIENCES OF DIFFERING LEVELS OF FAMILIARITY; THE PERSONAL REPORT OF COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION, A SIX-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPED TO MEASURE PUBLIC SPEAKING ANXIETY; AND THE FAMILY ENVIRONMENT SCALE, A 90-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPED TO MEASURE PERCEPTIONS OF FAMILY OF ORIGIN. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT A SIGNIFICANT SUBGROUP OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE MORE ANXIETY DELIVERING A SPEECH BEFORE A FAMILIAR AUDIENCE THAN BEFORE AN AUDIENCE OF STRANGERS. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT PEOPLE WHO EXPRESSED NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTIONS REGARDING THE AUDIENCE REPORTED HIGHER LEVELS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING ANXIETY THAN PEOPLE WHO EXPRESSED NEUTRAL OR POSITIVE ATTRIBUTIONS. FINALLY, THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUDIENCE FAMILIARITY ANXIETY AND THE EXPRESSION OF CERTAIN THEMES. THE RESULTS DID NOT SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIZED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUDIENCE FAMILIARITY ANXIETY AND HOLDING SPECIFIC BELIEFS ABOUT THE RISKS OF SPEAKING BEFORE A FAMILIAR VERSUS AN UNFAMILIAR AUDIENCE.

7,ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT IN MEN WITH HYPOGONADOTROPHIC HYPOGONADISM.,DWYER AA;TIEMENSMA J;QUINTON R;PITTELOUD N;MORIN D,CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY,,,,,2017,,,"OBJECTIVE: MEN WITH CONGENITAL HYPOGONADOTROPHIC HYPOGONADISM (CHH) TYPICALLY REQUIRE LIFELONG HORMONAL THERAPY, AND DISCONTINUING TREATMENT CAN HAVE NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT OR THE PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPACT OF CHH.; DESIGN: A SEQUENTIAL, MULTIPLE METHODS APPROACH WAS USED. A QUANTITATIVE ONLINE SURVEY ASSESSED ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS. SUBSEQUENTLY, QUALITATIVE FOCUS GROUPS EXPLORED PATIENT-REPORTED FACTORS FOR ADHERENCE.; PATIENTS: ADULT MEN WITH CHH ON AT LEAST 1 YEAR OF TREATMENT WERE RECRUITED INTERNATIONALLY.; MEASUREMENTS: ADHERENCE (MORISKY MEDICATION ADHERENCE SCALE), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE) AND PATIENT PERCEPTION OF CHH (REVISED ILLNESS PERCEPTION QUESTIONNAIRE) WERE ASSESSED IN AN ONLINE SURVEY, AND COMPARISONS WERE MADE TO REFERENCE GROUPS. PATIENT FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WERE CONDUCTED AND THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY PATIENT-REPORTED FACTORS FOR ADHERENCE.; RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 101 MEN ON LONG-TERM TREATMENT WERE INCLUDED (MEAN AGE 37 ± 11 YEARS). FORTY THREE PERCENT (43/101) EXHIBITED LOW MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND A SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED PREVALENCE OF MILD, MODERATE OR SEVERE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (27%, 17%, 20%, RESPECTIVELY, ALL P < 0·001 VS REFERENCE POPULATION). PATIENTS REPORTED NEGATIVE ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSEQUENCES. FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS (N = 3, 26 TOTAL PATIENTS) IDENTIFIED PATIENT-, HEALTH PROFESSIONAL- AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM-RELATED BARRIERS AS TARGETS FOR IMPROVING ADHERENCE.; CONCLUSIONS: CONGENITAL HYPOGONADOTROPHIC HYPOGONADISM MEN ARE CHALLENGED TO ADHERE TO LONG-TERM TREATMENT. POOR ADHERENCE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO ADVERSE EFFECTS ON BONE, SEXUAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. THE PSYCHOSOCIAL MORBIDITY OF CHH IS SIGNIFICANT AND APPEARS TO BE UNDERAPPRECIATED BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS.

GRAHAM AND L. STEPHENS (EDITORS). (SEE RECORD [RID]1995-97231-009[/RID].) THE CURRENT CHAPTER CHALLENGES A RANGE OF HARD-LINE VIEWS ABOUT ALCOHOL ABUSE, VIEWS THAT SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF ADEQUATE SINGLE-FACTOR CAUSAL ACCOUNTS OF ALCOHOL ABUSE, PATTERNS OF ALCOHOL ABUSE NEED NOT BE SEEN AS UNDERMINING OR MITIGATING THE ABUSER'S RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY CONTEXTS, IT UNDERMINES RESPONSIBILITY IN ALL. THE CHAPTER BEGINS BY REVIEWING THE MAJORITY OPINION OF A RECENT SUPREME COURT CASE AND DISCUSSING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DISEASES IN ATTRIBUTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEHAVIOR. THE CHAPTER ALSO EXAMINES THE VIEW THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR OWN CHARACTER IN LIGHT OF SOME RECENT MEDICAL UNCOVERINGS, IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HARD-LINE PERSPECTIVE ON ATTRIBUTIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY WOULD TURN OUR SELVES AND SOCIETY INTO ENTITIES BEREFT OF HUMANE UNDERSTANDING. SCHOEMAN DISCUSSES SOME PROBLEMS WITH THINKING THAT PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING WHAT CULTURAL OR TRADITIONAL NORMS THEY SHOULD ADOPT AND CONSIDER SOME COMMONSENSE CONSIDERATIONS THAT ATTENUATE OR QUALIFY ATTRIBUTIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY. THE CHAPTER CONCLUDES BY OBSERVING THAT THE WAY WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY FOR DRINKING PATTERNS IS NOT ONE ISSUE BUT MANY, AND ANSWERING IT REQUIRES THAT ATTENTION STILL BE PAID TO THE CONTEXT OF THE QUESTION. OTHER TOPICS DISCUSSED INCLUDE: (1) TRAYNOR AND MCKELVEY V. TURNAGE; (2) THE RELEVANCE OF DISEASE TO ATTRIBUTING BEHAVIOR; AND (3) CONSEQUENCES OF THE RESPONSIBLE-FOR-CHARACTER VIEW.

17,"RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PERCEIVED DIAGNOSTIC DISCLOSURE, PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS IN INDIAN CANCER PATIENTS",CHITTEM M;NORMAN P;HARRIS PR,PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY,,,,,2013,,,"OBJECTIVE NON-DISCLOSURE OF A CANCER DIAGNOSIS IS A COMMON PRACTICE IN MANY ASIAN CULTURES WHERE FAMILY-BASED MEDICAL DECISION MAKING IS THE NORM. THE PRESENT STUDY SOUGHT TO COMPARE INDIAN CANCER PATIENTS WHO WERE AWARE VERSUS UNAWARE OF THEIR CANCER DIAGNOSIS ON A RANGE OF PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS, LEVELS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS. METHODS A SAMPLE OF 329 INDIAN CANCER PATIENTS WERE INTERVIEWED ABOUT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR ILLNESS (TO ASSESS AWARENESS OF A CANCER DIAGNOSIS) AND ADMINISTERED THE FOLLOWING MEASURES: THE MODIFIED ROTTERDAM SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE, AND THE BRIEF ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS QUESTIONNAIRE. DEMOGRAPHIC AND MEDICAL DETAILS WERE ALSO OBTAINED. RESULTS OVER HALF OF THE SAMPLE (54.1\%) WAS UNAWARE OF THEIR CANCER DIAGNOSIS. A LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS PREDICTING PERCEIVED DIAGNOSTIC DISCLOSURE INDICATED THAT AWARENESS OF A CANCER DIAGNOSIS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH BEING INVOLVED IN MEDICAL DECISIONS, RECEIVING MULTIPLE TREATMENTS, LONGER TREATMENT DURATIONS, GREATER PERCEIVED UNDERSTANDING OF ONE'S ILLNESS (ILLNESS COHERENCE) AND CITING A CAUSE FOR ONE'S ILLNESS.

ONE OF THE FEW EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FINDINGS ON SCHIZOPHRENIA CONSISTENTLY DIVERGING FROM EXPECTED VALUES, THE SEX DIFFERENCE IN AGE AT FIRST ADMISSION, WAS TAKEN AS A BASIS AND REPLICATED ON DATA FROM THE DANISH AND THE MANNHEIM CASE REGISTERS BY CONTROLLING FOR SELECTION AND DIAGNOSTIC ARTEFACTS. DANISH PSYCHIATRISTS TURNED OUT TO HAVE UNDERDIAGNOSED SCHIZOPHRENIA TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT AT LEAST IN 1976, THE YEAR FROM WHICH THE ANALYSED CASE-REGISTER DATA DATED. AFTER THE EXCLUSION OF ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS, THE TIME WHEN SYMPTOMS APPEARED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE FIRST ACUTE EPISODE OCCURRED WAS DETERMINED FOR A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF 267 FIRST-ADMITTED CASES WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF NON-AFFECTIVE FUNCTIONAL DISORDER BY USING THE IRAOS INTERVIEW DESIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE. AT ANY OF THE DEFINITIONS OF FIRST ONSET APPLIED THE MEAN AGE OF FEMALES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF MALES, THE DIFFERENCE RANGING FROM 3.2 TO 4.1 YEARS. THE DISTRIBUTION OF ONSETS ACROSS THE FEMALE LIFE CYCLE SHOWED A CLEARLY DELAYED INCREASE AT YOUNG AGE AND A SECOND, LOWER PEAK OF ONSETS AT THE AGE OF 45-54, WHEREAS THE CUMULATIVE INCIDENCE UP TO THE AGE OF 60 YEARS WAS EQUAL FOR MALES AND FEMALES. ON ASSESSING THE PLAUSIBILITY OF PSYCHOSOCIAL VERSUS BIOLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT DUE TO THE EFFECT OF ESTROGENS THE VULNERABILITY THRESHOLD FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA IS RAISED IN FEMALES UNTIL THE MENOPAUSE. ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS AND POSTMORTEM ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT CHRONIC ESTROGEN APPLICATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED DOPAMINE-INDUCED BEHAVIOUR AND REDUCED D2 RECEPTOR SENSITIVITY IN THE BRAIN. THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM ON HUMAN SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS TESTED ON ACUTELY SCHIZOPHRENIC FEMALES WITH NORMAL MENSTRUAL CYCLES. A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN MEASURES OF SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND PLASMA ESTROGEN LEVELS. APPARENTLY, THE MANIFESTATION OF SCHIZOPHRENIC SYMPTOMS IS INFLUENCED BY A SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE D2 RECEPTOR SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN, BLOCKED BY NEUROLEPTICS AND MODULATED BY ESTROGENS.",,,SCHIZOPHRENIC PSYCHOLOGY*; SCHIZOPHRENIA/*DIAGNOSIS; ADOLESCENT; ADULT; AGE FACTORS; CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES; DENMARK/EPIDEMIOLOGY; FEMALE; HOSPITALIZATION/STATISTICS & NUMERICAL DATA; HUMANS; INCIDENCE; MALE; MIDDLE AGED; PSYCHIATRIC STATUS RATING SCALES; RISK FACTORS; SCHIZOPHRENIA/EPIDEMIOLOGY; SCHIZOPHRENIA/ETIOLOGY; SEX FACTORS

RECOGNIZING AND RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF A SUICIDAL ADOLESCENT IS CHALLENGING FOR THE PROFESSIONAL AS THEY ATTEMPT TO BALANCE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE YOUNG PERSON WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY FOLLOWING CUSTOMARY RULES OF ENGAGING IN SITUATIONS INVOLVING SUICIDE. THE NEED FOR THEORY TO DEEPEN UNDERSTANDING OF CHILD AND YOUTH CARE PROFESSIONALS' MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY PRACTICES WITH SUICIDAL ADOLESCENTS LED TO THIS GROUNDED THEORY STUDY. DERIVED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH 19 PARTICIPANTS INCLUDING CHILD AND YOUTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, SUPERVISORS AT YOUTH-SERVING AGENCIES, EDUCATORS IN SCHOOLS OF CHILD AND YOUTH CARE, AND TEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF POLICIES, ASSESSMENT TOOLS, AND CURRICULA, THE BALANCING PERIMETER AND PROXIMITY PROCESS WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE CORE CATEGORY IN THE ANALYSIS. THE BALANCING PROCESS SUGGESTS PROFESSIONALS' MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY PRACTICES FLUCTUATE BETWEEN CIRCLING CARE AND CIRCLING DEFENSIVELY. CIRCLING DEFENSIVELY REFERS TO THE PROFESSIONAL TAKING UP LITERACY PRACTICES THAT ESTABLISH A PERIMETER OF PROTECTION; WHEREAS LITERACY PRACTICES WITHIN CIRCLING CARE POSITION THE PROFESSIONAL IN RELATIONAL PROXIMITY WHERE THEY CONNECT AND ATTEND TO THE ADOLESCENT HOLISTICALLY. THE THEORY EXTENDS CURRENT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY, AND CONTEXTUALIZES PROFESSIONALS' PRACTICE IN IDENTIFYING THE CONDITIONS INFLUENCING THE BALANCING PROCESS, THEREBY PROVIDING AN UNDERSTANDING FOR HOW EXISTING STRUCTURES (E.G., SUICIDE EDUCATION, AGENCY POLICIES) INFLUENCE CHILD AND YOUTH CARE PROFESSIONALS' MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY PRACTICES WITH SUICIDAL ADOLESCENTS.

METHOD: A LITERATURE SEARCH OF ELECTRONIC DATABASES INCLUDING MEDLINE AND PSYCINFO USING SUCH SEARCH TERMS AS ‘FAMILY VIOLENCE’, ‘CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT’, ‘SPOUSAL ABUSE’, AND ‘ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT’ IN THE ARAB WORLD, REGION OR COUNTRIES WAS CONDUCTED. RESULT: FAMILY VIOLENCE IS WIDESPREAD IN THE ARAB WORLD. CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS OF THE PROBLEM RANGE FROM THE INTRAPERSONAL TO HUMAN RIGHTS PERSPECTIVES. SUCH EXPLANATIONS INVOKE THE IMPERATIVES OF CULTURALLY INFORMED, EVIDENCE-BASED AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY ASSESSMENTS, TREATMENTS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS.

SOCIAL COGNITION – THE ABILITY TO PERCEIVE, INTERPRET, AND RESPOND TO OTHER PEOPLE – IS CONSIDERED FUNDAMENTAL IN MAKING USE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT. GAINING KNOWLEDGE ON THE LINK BETWEEN PTSD AND SOCIAL COGNITION IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL.

THE FOLLOWING SCHEMA SUMMARIZES THE CONCEPT OF FORM AS IT APPLIES TO JASPERS' PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; THE DEBT TO KANT'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE IS CLEAR: (1) FORM IS A CATEGORY, A LANGUAGE, A TAXONOMY, A CONCEPTUAL SCHEME OF THE WORLD. (2) FORM DEFINES ALL THAT I EXPERIENCE AND ALL THAT I KNOW. (3) THE PRINCIPLES OF A FORM ARE INTERNAL TO THAT FORM; FORMS ARE INDEPENDENT AND INCOMMENSURABLE. (4) FORM IMPLIES A SELECTIVITY FROM THE FLOWING CHAOS OF REALITY. (5) ALL FORMS ARE INCOMPLETE IN THAT NO FORM CAN PROVIDE AN EXHAUSTIVE CLASSIFICATION OF THE WORLD. (6) FORM AND CONTENT ARE INDEPENDENT; ONE CONTENT CAN APPEAR IN DIFFERENT FORMS AND ONE FORM CAN HAVE MANY CONTENTS. (7) FORMS ARE HIERARCHICAL; FORM AT ONE LEVEL BECOMES CONTENT FOR A HIGHER FORM. THE KANTIAN DISTINCTION OF FORM AND CONTENT UNDERPINS BOTH JASPERS' PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND HIS PHILOSOPHY.

A SERIES OF REGRESSIONS SHOWED THAT SEX, AGE, MEDIA INTEREST, POLITICAL BELIEFS, EXPERIENCE WITH DEPRESSION AND OTHER MENTAL ILLNESSES AS WELL AS HAVING KNOWN OF OTHERS DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION PREDICTED DIFFERENT BELIEFS ABOUT THE CAUSES AND CURES OF DEPRESSION. CONCLUSION: PEOPLE HAVE A DETAILED AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL VIEW OF THE CAUSES AND CURES FOR DEPRESSION WHICH IS SYSTEMATICALLY RELATED TO EACH OTHER.",,,DEPRESSION; MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY; AGE

METHODS IN-DEPTH QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 47 (FEMALE = 31) HIV-POSITIVE ADULTS WHO SCORED ABOVE THE CUT-POINT ON A LOCALLY VALIDATED SCALE FOR COMMON MENTAL DISORDERS (CMDS). PURPOSIVE SAMPLING WAS USED TO RECRUIT PARTICIPANTS WITH EVIDENCE OF POOR ADHERENCE. SIX ADDITIONAL KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS (FEMALE = 6) WERE CONDUCTED WITH HEALTHCARE WORKERS. DATA WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED INDUCTIVELY BY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY CODING TEAM. RESULTS THE MAJOR CHALLENGES FACED BY PARTICIPANTS WERE STRESSORS (POVERTY, STIGMA, MARITAL PROBLEMS) AND SYMPTOMS OF CMDS ('THINKING TOO MUCH', CHANGES TO APPETITE AND SLEEP, `BURDENED HEART' AND LOW ENERGY LEVELS). THINKING TOO MUCH, WHICH APPEARS CLOSELY RELATED TO RUMINATION, WAS THE SYMPTOM WITH THE GREATEST NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ADHERENCE TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY AMONG HIV-POSITIVE ADULTS WITH CMDS. IN TURN, THINKING TOO MUCH WAS COMMONLY TRIGGERED BY THE STRESSORS FACED BY PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS, ESPECIALLY POVERTY. FINALLY, PARTICIPANTS DESIRED PRIVATE COUNSELLING, ACCESS TO INCOME-GENERATING ACTIVITIES AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE. CONCLUSIONS BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOCAL EXPRESSION OF MENTAL DISORDERS AND OF UNDERLYING STRESSORS CAN INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURALLY SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE CMDS AND POOR ADHERENCE TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY.",,,HIV/AIDS; DEPRESSION; MENTAL HEALTH; ADHERENCE; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY;; BARRIERS
38,ESCAPING THE PAST AND LIVING IN THE PRESENT: A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF SUBSTANCE USE AMONG SYRIAN MALE REFUGEES IN GERMANY,LINDERT J;NEUENDORF U;NATAN M;SCHAFER I,CONFLICT AND HEALTH,,,,,2021,,,"BACKGROUND: SYRIANS HAVE BEEN THE LARGEST GROUP OF REFUGEES IN GERMANY SINCE 2014. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT SYRIAN REFUGEES` PERSPECTIVES ON SUBSTANCE USE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSPECTIVE OF MALE REFUGEES FROM SYRIA AND TO FOSTER SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF SUBSTANCE USE. METHODS: WE APPLIED A QUALITATIVE STUDY DESIGN. FIVE SEMI-STRUCTURED FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH A TOTAL OF 19 REFUGEES WERE CONDUCTED IN 2019 AMONG THE DIFFICULT TO REACH POPULATION OF SYRIAN REFUGEES. AUDIO RECORDINGS WERE TRANSLATED AND TRANSCRIBED. WE USED A HYBRID APPROACH BY INTEGRATING INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE THEMATIC FRAMEWORKS. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED COMMON THEMES. FIRSTLY, REFUGEES PERCEIVED THAT SUBSTANCES ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND ACCEPTED IN GERMANY. SECONDLY, REFUGEES PERCEIVED THAT RULES AND NORMS IN GERMANY DIFFER FROM RULES AND NORMS IN THE HOME COUNTRY AND FAVOR AVAILABILITY OF SUBSTANCES. THIRDLY, SUBSTANCE USE IS RELATED TO THE INTENTION TO ESCAPE THE PAST. FOURTHLY, SUBSTANCE USE IS RELATED TO LIVING IN THE PRESENT THROUGH CONNECTING WITH OTHERS AND BEING PART OF THE COMMUNITY. FINALLY, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH SHAME. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUPPORT SYRIAN REFUGEES` PERSPECTIVES OF SUBSTANCE USE AS A WAY OF BOTH ESCAPING THE PAST AND COPING WITH PSYCHOSOCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE PRESENT IN A SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING. UNDERSTANDING THE EXPLANATORY MODEL OF SYRIAN REFUGEES CAN INFORM FUTURE INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND DESIGN TAILORED INTERVENTIONS. FURTHER STUDIES WITH SYRIAN REFUGEES IN MORE COUNTRIES ARE NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND RESETTLED REFUGEES` PERSPECTIVES ON SUBSTANCE USE.",,,TRAUMA; MENTAL HEALTH; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; REFUGEE POPULATIONS;; SUBSTANCE USE; ESCAPE; SYRIA

AIM OF THE STUDY: TO STUDY STIGMA IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA (IN THE FORM OF INTERNALIZED STIGMA, PERCEIVED STIGMA AND SOCIAL-PARTICIPATION-RESTRICTION STIGMA) AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH SPECIFIED DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES (DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, CLINICAL PROFILE, LEVEL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ILLNESS, AND INSIGHT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: SELECTED BY PURPOSIVE RANDOM SAMPLING, 100 PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA IN REMISSION WERE EVALUATED ON INTERNALIZED STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESS SCALE (ISMIS), EXPLANATORY MODEL INTERVIEW CATALOG STIGMA SCALE, PARTICIPATION SCALE (P-SCALE), POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA, GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF FUNCTIONING SCALE, SCALE TO ASSESS UNAWARENESS OF MENTAL DISORDER, AND KNOWLEDGE OF MENTAL ILLNESS SCALE. RESULTS: ON ISMIS SCALE, 81\% PATIENTS EXPERIENCED ALIENATION AND 45\% EXHIBITED STIGMA RESISTANCE. STEREOTYPE ENDORSEMENT WAS SEEN IN 26\% PATIENTS, DISCRIMINATION EXPERIENCE WAS FACED BY 21\% PATIENTS, AND ONLY 16\% PATIENTS HAD SOCIAL WITHDRAWAL. OVERALL, 29\% PARTICIPANTS HAD INTERNALIZED STIGMA WHEN TOTAL ISMIS SCORE WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. ON P-SCALE, 67\% PATIENTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTION, WITH A MAJORITY REPORTING MODERATE TO MILD RESTRICTION. IN TERMS OF ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN STIGMA AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, NO CONSISTENT CORRELATIONS EMERGED, EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO WERE NOT ON PAID JOB, HAD HIGHER PARTICIPATION RESTRICTION. OF THE CLINICAL VARIABLES, LEVEL OF FUNCTIONING WAS THE ONLY CONSISTENT PREDICTOR OF STIGMA. WHILE BETTER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DISORDER WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVEL OF STIGMA, THERE WAS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STIGMA AND INSIGHT. CONCLUSION: SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA EXPERIENCE STIGMA AND STIGMA IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVEL OF FUNCTIONING AND BETTER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ILLNESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVEL OF STIGMA.",,,CORRELATES; INSIGHT; KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ILLNESS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; STIGMA

A TOTAL OF 62 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT RENAL TRANSPLANTATION IN THE UROLOGICAL KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION WARD FROM A COMPREHENSIVE 3A HOSPITAL OF FUJIAN PROVINCE, FROM DECEMBER 2016 TO FEBRUARY 2018, WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUP. THERE WERE 31 PATIENTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP WHO UNDERWENT ROUTINE RENAL TRANSPLANTATION COMBINED WITH ATTRIBUTION TRAINING, WHILE 31 PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED ROUTINE RENAL TRANSPLANTATION. FIVE INSTRUMENTS WERE APPLIED TO EVALUATE THESE TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS WHICH ARE THE BASIC DATA QUESTIONNAIRE, DEPRESSION SCALE (SDS), SELF-RATING ANXIETY SCALE (SAS), REVISED PIPER FATIGUE SCALE (RPFS), ATTRIBUTION QUESTIONNAIRE (ASQ), PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI). ATTRIBUTION TRAINING CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE PATIENT’S ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE, REDUCE DEPRESSION, IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY AND RELEASE FATIGUE. THE EARLY POSTOPERATIVE DEPRESSION OF RENAL TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS IS SERIOUS WHILE ATTRIBUTION TRAINING CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE DEPRESSION, THE SLEEP QUALITY AND FATIGUE, WHICH SOLVES THE CRITICAL PROBLEMS OF CLINICAL PRACTICE OF KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION. THUS A STRONG BASIS FOR EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS IMPROVEMENT CAN BE PROVIDED FOR RENAL TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS.

45,THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMOTION PERCEPTION AND THEORY OF MIND IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM,AVERILL CM,NA,,,,,2000,,,"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMOTION PERCEPTION AND THEORY OF MIND WAS EXAMINED IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. AUTISTIC SUBJECTS (N = 9) WERE INDIVIDUALLY MATCHED TO NON-AUTISTIC CONTROL SUBJECTS ON THE BASIS OF CHRONOLOGICAL AGE AND NONVERBAL MENTAL AGE (N = 9) OR VERBAL MENTAL AGE (N = 9). THE TEST BATTERY INCLUDED THE FACIAL DISCRIMINATION TASK - MATCHING (FDT-M) AND FOUR STANDARD FIRST-ORDER THEORY OF MIND TASKS. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT, COMPARED TO BOTH CONTROL GROUPS, AUTISTIC SUBJECTS DID NOT DEMONSTRATE A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT IN EMOTION PERCEPTION, BUT MORE GLOBAL DEFICITS ACROSS THE FDT-M. EMOTION TASK PERFORMANCE WAS RELATED TO VERBAL ABILITY, ESPECIALLY FOR AUTISTIC SUBJECTS. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE AUTISTIC AND CONTROL GROUPS IN THEIR ABILITY TO ATTRIBUTE FALSE BELIEFS. OVERALL PERFORMANCE ON THE THEORY OF MIND TASKS (THEORY OF MIND COMPOSITE SCORE) WAS RELATED TO VERBAL ABILITY. THERE WAS NO APPARENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERFORMANCE ON THE FDT-M EMOTION TASK AND PERFORMANCE ON THE THEORY OF MIND TASKS FOR ANY OF THE GROUPS. A SUPPLEMENTARY SET OF ANALYSES WAS RUN, INCLUDING ALL OF THE SUBJECTS WHO HAD BEEN TESTED AS PART OF THE STUDY. TWO GROUPS OF SUBJECTS PARTICIPATED IN THESE ANALYSES, AN AUTISTIC GROUP (N = 21) AND A CONTROL GROUP OF NON-AUTISTIC INDIVIDUALS (N = 36). THE RESULTS AGAIN INDICATED THAT, COMPARED TO CONTROLS, AUTISTIC SUBJECTS DID NOT DEMONSTRATE A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT IN EMOTION PERCEPTION. FDT-M EMOTION TASK PERFORMANCE WAS RELATED TO ALL DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES, ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE VARIABLES UNIQUELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE EMOTION TASK SCORE. THE AUTISTIC SUBJECTS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN CONTROLS ON ONLY ONE OF THE FALSE-BELIEF TASKS, THE SALLY-ANN TASK. PERFORMANCE ON THE THEORY OF MIND TASKS WAS RELATED TO ALL DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES EXCEPT AGE, ALTHOUGH ONLY THE PPVT STANDARD SCORE UNIQUELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE THEORY OF MIND COMPOSITE SCORE. A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN PERFORMANCE ON THE FDT-M EMOTION TASK AND PERFORMANCE ON THE THEORY OF MIND TASKS WHEN THE GROUPS WERE COMBINED; HOWEVER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FDT-M AGE-CONTROL TASK SCORE AND THE THEORY OF MIND COMPOSITE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT.

A MEDIATION MODEL WAS PROPOSED WHEREBY THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND PATIENT SAFETY PERCEPTIONS WAS MEDIATED BY BURNOUT. BACKGROUNDTHERE IS GROWING INTEREST IN THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND BURNOUT IN HEALTHCARE STAFF AND THE SAFETY OF PATIENT CARE. DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HIGHER IN HEALTHCARE STAFF THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND OVERLAP CONCEPTUALLY WITH BURNOUT. HOWEVER, MINIMAL RESEARCH HAS INVESTIGATED THESE VARIABLES IN NURSES. GIVEN THE CONCEPTUAL OVERLAP BETWEEN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND BURNOUT, THERE IS ALSO A NEED FOR AN EXPLANATORY MODEL OUTLINING THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE FACTORS TO PATIENT SAFETY. DESIGNA CROSS-SECTIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DISTRIBUTED AT THREE ACUTE NHS TRUSTS. METHODTHREE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY-THREE HOSPITAL NURSING STAFF COMPLETED MEASURES OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, BURNOUT AND PATIENT SAFETY PERCEPTIONS (INCLUDING MEASURES AT THE LEVEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE WORK AREA/UNIT) BETWEEN DECEMBER 2015 - FEBRUARY 2016. RESULTSWHEN TESTED IN SEPARATE ANALYSES, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND BURNOUT FACETS WERE EACH ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH PATIENT SAFETY MEASURES. FURTHERMORE, THE PROPOSED MEDIATION MODEL WAS SUPPORTED, WITH ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND PATIENT SAFETY PERCEPTIONS FULLY MEDIATED BY BURNOUT. CONCLUSIONTHESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND BURNOUT IN HOSPITAL NURSES MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT SAFETY.

ATTRIBUTING A ``POSITIVE ENERGY BALANCE'' OR ``NEGLIGENT PERSONALITY TRAIT'' AS RELEVANT CAUSE FOR THE OVERWEIGHT WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE ATTITUDES. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY CONFIRM AND COMPLEMENT FINDINGS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, MAINLY THE USA, AND INDICATE THAT WEIGHT BIAS IN THE HEALTH CARE SETTING MAY BE A GLOBAL ISSUE. STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES TOWARDS OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY ARE PREVALENT AMONG A SAMPLE OF MEDICAL STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LEIPZIG. NEGATIVE ATTITUDES ARISE ON THE BASIS OF HOLDING THE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE EXCESS WEIGHT. THEY CALL FOR BRINGING THE TOPIC OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY MORE INTO THE FOCUS OF THE MEDICAL CURRICULUM AND FOR ENHANCING MEDICAL STUDENTS' AWARENESS OF THE COMPLEX AETIOLOGY OF THIS HEALTH CONDITION.",,,NA

ONE GOAL OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE WHETHER AN ABNORMALITY OF ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE IS CONFINED TO PATIENTS WITH PERSECUTORY DELUSIONS OR EXTENDS TO CURRENTLY NON-DELUDED PATIENTS. A SECOND GOAL WAS TO TEST WHETHER PARANOID PATIENTS SHOW AN EXTERNAL-PERSONAL RATHER THAN AN EXTERNAL-SITUATIONAL ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE FOR BLAME. AN ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLES QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA (N = 35), DEPRESSION (N = 18), AND ANXIETY DISORDERS (N = 34), AS WELL AS A HEALTHY CONTROL GROUP (N = 28). FOR EACH EVENT (POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE OUTCOME) PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO WRITE DOWN WHAT MAY HAVE LED TO THIS EVENT, AND THEN TO ENDORSE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THIS EVENT WAS CAUSED BY OTHERS/CIRCUMSTANCES OR THEMSELVES. ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKERT SCALE RATINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT WHILE HEALTHY SUBJECTS DISPLAYED A SIGNIFICANT SELF-SERVING BIAS, CURRENTLY PARANOID AND NON-PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS PERFORMED INTERMEDIATELY BETWEEN HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS AND DEPRESSED PATIENTS. ANALYSIS OF CODED VERBAL STATEMENTS INDICATED THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF EVENT TYPE (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE) PATIENTS WITH PERSECUTORY DELUSIONS HAD AN EVEN-HANDED ATTRIBUTION BIAS, WHEREAS ALL OTHER GROUPS PREDOMINANTLY REGARDED THEMSELVES AS CAUSAL. THE LATTER FINDING INDICATES THAT ACUTE PARANOIA MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASED LOCUS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, WHICH MAY PROMOTE THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN PARANOID BELIEFS (E.G., FEELINGS OF ALIEN CONTROL AND PASSIVITY EXPERIENCES, RESPECTIVELY).

METHODS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW HAS SUMMARIZED EVIDENCES FROM THE LITERATURE REGARDING THE NEWER PHARMACOLOGICAL TARGETS PROPOSED FOR THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHOSIS. WE INCLUDED 128 PEER -REVIEWED ARTICLES AND 5 OTHER RELEVANT SOURCES PUBLISHED FROM 2002 TO 2020 ON PUBMED EMBASE, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. RESULTS: THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF GLUTAMATE AND ITS RECEPTORS AS TARGETS OF THE ANTIPSYCHOTIC MECHANISM OF ACTION HAS BEEN DESCRIBED. GLUTAMATERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION AND NMDA RECEPTORS HYPOFUNCTION ARE INVOLVED IN THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL EXPLANATORY MODEL OF PSYCHOSIS AND POSSIBLY TARGETED FOR THE SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT OF COGNITIVE AND RESIDUAL SYMPTOMS. RESULTS SHOW AN EFFICACY OF D-CYCLOSERINE (ANTAGONIST AT THE GLYCINE SITE OF THE NMDA-R) IN THE TREATMENT OF NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AS WELL AS MEMANTINE (NMDA-RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST) FOR COGNITION AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY. THE PUTATIVE ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECT OF CANNABIDIOL ON POSITIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITION WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSED. THE ACTION ON SEROTONINERGIC AND GABAERGIC RECEPTORS WILL BE CONSIDERED AS A NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL TARGET, WITH A POSSIBLE EFFICACY OF VABICASERIN ON SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOSIS. MYNOCICLINE HAS SHOWN TO INDUCE IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA, AS WELL AS ERYTHROPOIETIN. OXYTOCIN HAS BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE AN ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE EFFECT; MOREOVER, COX-2 INHIBITORS LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN POSITIVE SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOSIS, SPECIFICALLY IN THE FIRST EPISODE OF ILLNESS.

THE RESEARCH METHOD WAS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL WITH PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN AND FOLLOW-UP WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. FIRST, 410 INDIVIDUAL FEMALE STUDENTS COMPLETED THE BECK-II DEPRESSION INVENTORY BY SCREENING TEST. THOSE WHO ACHIEVED A STANDARD DEVIATION ABOVE THE MEAN OF THE GROUP RECEIVED A STRUCTURED CLINICAL INTERVIEW. THEN, 24 PARTICIPANTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION AND INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS OF 4 IN EACH EXPERIMENT. THE INSTRUMENT OF MEASUREMENT IN THIS STUDY WAS BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II AND ATTRIBUTION STYLE OF SELIGMAN AND SINGH. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP UNDERWENT 8 SESSIONS OF 2-HOUR SESSIONS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY. AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION, POST-TEST AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION, THE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS WERE FOLLOWED UP. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL TESTS INCLUDING UNIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE ATTRIBUTION STYLE OF EVENTS WITH GOOD OUTCOME AND DECREASED THE ATTRIBUTION STYLE OF EVENTS WITH BAD OUTCOME.

WE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND OLDER PATIENTS' VIEWS REGARDING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DEPRESSION AND HEART DISEASE TO FACILITATE PATIENT-PROVIDER COMMUNICATION ABOUT HEART DISEASE AND DEPRESSION AND TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS. METHODS: THE DESIGN WAS A QUALITATIVE STUDY USING SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. IN ALL, 33 PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS 65 YEARS AND OVER WITH DYSPHORIA, ANHEDONIA, HOPELESSNESS, WORTHLESSNESS, OR SLEEP DISTURBANCE WHO WERE TAKING AT LEAST ONE MEDICATION TARGETING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS WERE INTERVIEWED IN THE OFFICE OF THEIR PRIMARY CARE CLINICIAN. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT DEPRESSION AND HEART DISEASE AND THEIR TREATMENT. A MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM CODED THE TRANSCRIPTS AND IDENTIFIED KEY THEMES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS GAVE CLEAR DESCRIPTIONS OF HOW HEART DISEASE CAN LEAD TO DEPRESSION AND DEPRESSION CAN LEAD TO HEART DISEASE. PARTICIPANTS SUPPORTED TREATING DEPRESSION IMMEDIATELY IN THE CONTEXT OF HEART DISEASE AND GENERALLY PREFERRED INTEGRATED CARE.

IN ADDITION, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT MIGHT ACT AS PREDISPNSING TRIGGERING, OR MAINTAINING FACTORS FOR SUCH EXERCISE. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED THE PRESENCE OF EXCESSIVE EXERCISE IN DIFFERENT WOMEN WITH EATING DISORDERS, AND ITS PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL CORRELATES. METHODS: CASE NOTES FROM 63 ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND 67 BULIMIA NERVOSA PATIENTS WERE EXAMINED. TWO-WAY MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES OF VARIANCE (DIAGNOSIS X USE OF EXCESSIVE EXERCISE) WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THE TWO FACTORS UPON EATING CHARACTERISTICS (EAT-40 AND BITE) AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS (SCL-90-R). RESULTS: WHILE HIGH LEVELS OF DEPRESSION WERE MORE LIKELY AMONG ALL PATIENTS WHO USED EXCESSIVE EXERCISE, LEVELS OF ANXIETY, AND SOMATIZATION WERE PARTICULARLY HIGH ONLY AMONG THOSE ANOREXICS WHO EXERCISED EXCESSIVELY,. DISCUSSION: POSSIBLE EXPLANATORY MODELS ARE ADVANCED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS PATTERN OF FINDINGS, FOCUSING ON THE POSSIBLE USE OF EXERCISE AS AN AFFECT REGULATION STRATEGY, AMONG ANOREXIA NERVOSA PATIENTS.

THEORETICAL MODELS AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGEST THIS RELATION MAY BE INFLUENCED BY HOSTILE INTERPERSONAL ATTRIBUTIONS (CRICK & DODGE, 1996) AND BIOLOGICAL SEX (DRYBURGH & VACHON, 2019). THE PRESENT RESEARCH SOUGHT TO EXAMINE THE UNIQUE AND INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS, SEX, AND PRIMED HOSTILE ATTRIBUTIONS ON PERFORMANCE DURING AN ANALOG AGGRESSION TASK. STUDENTS FROM UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY COURSES WERE RECRUITED IN TWO GROUPS: A TRAUMA-EXPOSED GROUP REPORTING PROBABLE TRAUMA EXPOSURE AND ONGOING DISTRESS, AND A TRAUMA-NAÏVE CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN IN-LAB TASK IN WHICH THEY ASSIGNED THE INTENSITY OF A WHITE NOISE BLAST FOR THEIR SUPPOSED 'OPPONENT' IN A SERIES OF REACTION TIME TRIALS (I.E., AINSWORTH & MAINER, 2014). A RANDOMLY SELECTED NEUTRAL OR HOSTILE LEXICAL PRIME WAS PRESENTED PRIOR TO EACH TRIAL. MEAN NOISE INTENSITY ASSIGNED BY PARTICIPANTS DURING NEUTRAL AND HOSTILE TRIALS SERVED AS THE PRIMARY OUTCOME. A 2 (TRAUMA) X 2 (SEX) X 2 (PRIME) MIXED FACTORIAL ANOVA WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE RESULTS. A CONDITIONAL EFFECT OF PRIMING STIMULI WAS NOTED, WITH TRIALS PRECEDED BY HOSTILE PRIMING STIMULI RESULTING IN GREATER LEVELS OF AGGRESSION. TWO-WAY INTERACTIONS WERE NOTED FOR TRAUMA EXPOSURE AND SEX, SUCH THAT TRAUMA-EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS AND MALE PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER AGGRESSION DURING HOSTILE VERSUS NEUTRAL TRIALS.

ONLY A FEW STUDIES HAVE ADDRESSED MENTAL ILLNESS STIGMA IN AFRICA, AND THEY TEND TO BE NON-REPRESENTATIVE. USING A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF 1,550 ADULTS FROM THE STIGMA IN GLOBAL CONTEXT-MENTAL HEALTH STUDY, THIS STUDY APPLIES THE ETIOLOGY AND EFFECTS OF STIGMA MODEL TO FRAME AND EVALUATE MENTAL ILLNESS STIGMA IN SOUTH AFRICA. ANALYSES INVESTIGATE CAUSAL ATTRIBUTES, STIGMA, AND THE LINKS BETWEEN THEM, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HOW DEMOGRAPHICS STRUCTURE BOTH. FINDINGS SHOW THAT CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS ARE COMPLEX AND THAT MENTAL ILLNESS STIGMA EXISTS IN SOUTH AFRICA WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA DRAWING MORE STIGMA THAN DEPRESSION. SOUTH AFRICANS ARE HESITANT TO ENGAGE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IN MARITAL RELATIONS AND CHILDCARE. FOR THE MOST PART, SOCIAL-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF PERSONS DESCRIBED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH STIGMA. HOWEVER, BLACKS STAND OUT AS RECIPIENTS OF NEGATIVE WHITE RESPONSES. GENDER IS ONLY SIGNIFICANT WHEN INTERACTED WITH SELECTED CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, MALES WHO ENDORSE NORMAL UPS AND DOWN AS CAUSE OF ILLNESS ARE MORE INTOLERANT THAN FEMALES. BIOGENETIC CAUSES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INTOLERANCE, WHILE NON-BIOGENETIC ATTRIBUTES REVEAL TOLERANT ATTITUDES. FURTHER, BLACK, MALE, AND LOWLY EDUCATED RESPONDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENDORSE NON-BIOGENETIC CAUSES FOR MENTAL ILLNESS. IN SUM, THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONTEXT IS NOT UNIQUE; HOWEVER, UNLIKE OTHER PAST STUDIES, RACE AND ETHNICITY MATTER. THIS IS NOT SURPRISING GIVEN SOUTH AFRICA’S HISTORY OF APARTHEID AND ITS VESTIGES THAT HAVE STRUCTURED INTERACTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATION’S DIVERSE RACIAL GROUPS. CORRESPONDING TO THE ETIOLOGY AND EFFECTS OF STIGMA MODEL, CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS AND SELECTED SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCE MENTAL ILLNESS STIGMA IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE RESPONDENTS’ RACE HAS DIRECT INFLUENCE WHILE GENDER IS INDIRECTLY RELATED TO STIGMA. INTERNAL ATTRIBUTIONS LEAD TO INCREASED STIGMA WHILE EXTERNALIZED CAUSES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE TOLERANCE. THIS STUDY EXTENDS STIGMA WORK TO NON-WESTERN CONTEXTS AND ADVANCES OUR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF DISEASE STIGMA IN AFRICA. THEREFORE, IT INFORMS ANTI-STIGMA EFFORTS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE ONGOING DEBATE ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE OF MENTAL ILLNESS LABELS, ATTRIBUTIONS, AND STIGMA.

IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THESE CAREGIVERS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE VARIABLES THAT EXPLAIN THE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN CAREGIVING. SPECIFICALLY, VARIABLES WHICH COULD PREDICT CAREGIVERS' RISK OF DEPRESSION AND BURDEN WOULD BE HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED OF EARLY CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS. THE STUDY INVESTIGATED THE VARIABLES, ATTRIBUTION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT AS PREDICTORS OF CAREGIVER DEPRESSION, MEASURED BY THE MULTISCORE DEPRESSION INVENTORY (MDI) AND SUBJECTIVE BURDEN, MEASURED BY THE ZARIT BURDEN INTERVIEW (BI).

IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS OF PARENTS WHO BELIEVE IN A CAUSAL ROLE OF VACCINES FOR AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) IN THEIR CHILD MAY HELP TARGETING EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVE ADHERENCE TO THE IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE. OBJECTIVES: TO COMPARE CAREGIVERS OF CHILDREN WITH ASD WHO AGREE OR DISAGREE THAT VACCINES PLAY AN ETIOLOGICAL ROLE IN AUTISM FOR 1) SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS CHARACTERISTICS AND 2) DEVELOPMENTAL AND CLINICAL PROFILES OF THEIR CHILDREN. METHODS: DATA FROM 16,525 PARTICIPANTS WITH ASD UNDER AGE 18 WERE OBTAINED FROM SPARK, A NATIONAL RESEARCH COHORT STARTED IN 2016. CAREGIVERS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AT REGISTRATION THAT INCLUDED QUESTIONS ON BELIEFS ABOUT THE ETIOLOGIC ROLE OF CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS IN ASD. DATA WERE AVAILABLE ABOUT FAMILY SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, FIRST SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM, DEVELOPMENTAL REGRESSION, CO-OCCURRING PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, SEIZURES, AND CURRENT LEVELS OF FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS WITH ASD WERE 80.4\% MALE WITH A MEAN AGE OF 8.1 YEARS (SD = 4.1). OVERALL, 16.5\% OF CAREGIVERS ENDORSED IMMUNIZATIONS AS PERCEIVED CAUSES OF AUTISM. COMPARED TO CAREGIVERS WHO DISAGREED WITH VACCINES AS A CAUSE FOR ASD, THOSE WHO BELIEVED IN VACCINE CAUSATION CAME DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM ETHNIC MINORITY, LESS EDUCATED, AND LESS WEALTHY BACKGROUNDS.

IN STUDY 1 (N = 108, M (AGE) = 9.73, 50 MALE), CHILDREN'S SELF-REPORTED ATTRIBUTIONS FOR HYPOTHETICAL EVENTS MEDIATED THE LINK BETWEEN PARENTAL CONDITIONAL NEGATIVE REGARD AND CHILD DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS.

ALTHOUGH ITS NEGATIVE IMPACT MAY BE LIMITED IN SOME WAY BY THE USE OF DIFFERENT TREATMENT OPTIONS, LACK OF ADHERENCE TO PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT IS STILL AN OBSTACLE TO OVERCOME. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY FACTORS INVOLVED IN NON-ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT, IN THIS STUDY, WE SOUGHT TO EXAMINE THE SUBJECTIVE ASPECT OF THIS PHENOMENON. WE ANALYSED PERCEPTIONS OF BOTH THE DISEASE AND THE TREATMENT IN A GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER. METHODS: WE INCORPORATED A QUALITATIVE DESIGN THAT INCLUDED 50 OUTPATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER TYPE 1. THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, WE EXPLORED PATIENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF BIPOLARITY AND PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THE USE OF MEDICATIONS AS ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECTS OF HAVING BIPOLAR DISORDER. THE FEAR OF BECOMING ADDICTED TO PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS WAS REPEATEDLY MENTIONED AMONG THE PATIENTS AS AN ARGUMENT FOR ABANDONING TREATMENT. THE MAIN EXPECTATION OF TREATMENT WAS TO ACHIEVE STABLE MOOD, BUT THE PATIENTS CONSIDERED THAT DRUGS WERE NOT THE ONLY WAY TO BE EUTHYMIC. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: THE PATIENTS EXPRESSED AMBIVALENCE BETWEEN THE NEED TO TAKE MEDICATION TO REMAIN STABLE AND THE FEAR OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF USING PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS. PERSONAL BELIEFS AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES SEEM TO DETERMINE EACH INDIVIDUAL’S FINAL CHOICE OF WHETHER TO MAINTAIN OR DISCONTINUE TREATMENT; SO, IN EVERYDAY CLINICAL PRACTICE, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DISCUSS PERCEPTIONS OF THE DISEASE WITH PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

PSYCHOSOCIAL MODELS OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT SUGGEST THAT PARENTAL ATTRIBUTIONS OF CHILD AND ADULT CONTROLLABILITY COULD MODERATE THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHILD DISABILITY STATUS AND BEHAVIOUR. METHODS: THE INFLUENCE OF PARENTAL ATTRIBUTIONS OF ADULT AND CHILD CONTROLLABILITY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROBLEM BEHAVIOURS AND DISABILITY WAS EXPLORED IN MOTHERS OF CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES (DD) (N = 20) WITH A MEAN AGE OF 9 YEARS 3 MONTHS (SD 24.6 MONTHS), AND IN MOTHERS OF TYPICALLY DEVELOPING (TD) CHILDREN (N = 26) WITH A MEAN AGE OF 9 YEARS 4 MONTHS (STANDARD DEVIATION 23.7 MONTHS). THE DD GROUP COMPRISED 11 CHILDREN WITH AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDERS OR OTHER COMMUNICATION IMPAIRMENTS, THREE CHILDREN WITH DOWN SYNDROME, ONE WITH CEREBRAL PALSY, ONE WITH ATTENTIONAL PROBLEMS, AND FOUR WITH SPECIFIC OR COMPLEX DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS. CHILD BEHAVIOUR WAS MEASURED BY THE CHILD BEHAVIOUR CHECKLIST. PARENTAL ATTRIBUTIONS WERE MEASURED USING A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE PARENT ATTRIBUTION TEST AND MOTHERS WERE DIVIDED INTO HIGHER AND LOWER CONTROLLABILITY GROUPS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RESPONSES ON THIS TEST. RESULTS: MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOUND SIGNIFICANT GROUP × ADULT CONTROLLABILITY INTERACTION EFFECTS FOR ‘AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR’, ‘RULE-BREAKING BEHAVIOUR’, AS WELL AS BORDERLINE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR ‘SOCIAL PROBLEMS’ AND ‘OTHER PROBLEMS’. SIMPLE EFFECTS ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT WHEN MOTHERS HAD LOWER ATTRIBUTIONS OF ADULT CONTROLLABILITY, THERE WERE INDEED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PROBLEM BEHAVIOURS IN THE DD GROUP, BUT WHEN MOTHERS HAD ATTRIBUTIONS OF HIGHER ADULT CONTROLLABILITY THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: PARENTAL ATTRIBUTIONS OF CONTROLLABILITY MAY MODERATE THE WELL-ESTABLISHED EFFECT OF DISABILITY ON PROBLEM BEHAVIOUR. IMPLICATIONS FOR PARENT INTERVENTION PROGRAMMES ARE DISCUSSED.

AS A PURPOSIVE OUTGROWTH OF MODULARITY, SELF-DECEPTION MAY SERVE TO ISOLATE THREATENING THOUGHTS FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND FACILITATE COOPERATION. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION WAS TO DETERMINE IF INDIVIDUALS WITH DEPRESSION EXHIBIT BOTH LOW LEVELS OF SELF-DECEPTION AND COOPERATION. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TENDENCY TO SELF-DECEIVE AND THE CONSCIOUS ATTRIBUTIONS TYPICAL OF DEPRESSION OR PROMOTING COOPERATION WERE ALSO EXAMINED. EIGHTY UNDERGRADUATE PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES OF SELF-DECEPTION, IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT, DEPRESSION, AND ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLES. COOPERATION WAS ASSESSED BY RESPONSES TO SOCIAL DILEMMAS BASED ON THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA GAME. RESULTS INDICATED THAT, AS EXPECTED, HIGH SELF-DECEIVERS COOPERATED MORE AND EXHIBITED LOWER LEVELS OF DEPRESSION THAN LOW SELF-DECEIVERS.

METHODS: WE RECRUITED A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE FROM THE GERMAN GENERAL POPULATION (N = 2420; MEAN AGE: 52 YEARS; 54 \% WOMEN). STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES WERE ASSESSED WITH A 9-ITEM SCALE. PREDICTORS OF STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES WERE IDENTIFIED USING A REGRESSION ANALYSIS. RESULTS: AGREEMENT WITH STIGMATIZATION ITEMS RANGED FROM 3.6 \% (ITEM: WORK TOGETHER WITH A CANCER PATIENT) TO 18.9 \% (ITEM: USE THE SAME DISHES AS A CANCER PATIENT). PERCEIVED CAUSES OF DISEASE WITH A HIGH LEVELS OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY SHOWED ONLY WEAK CORRELATIONS WITH STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES (ALL R < 0.31) AND WERE PARTIALLY STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT (E.G. FOOD INTAKE) OR NOT SIGNIFICANT (E.G. ALCOHOL). THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES WERE LACK OF CANCER-RELATED EXPERIENCES (BETA = -0,26), AGE < 60 YEARS (BETA = 0,1) AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT ONE CANNOT PROTECT ONESELF FROM CANCER (BETA = 0,11) (ALL P < 0.001). FURTHER PREDICTORS WERE MALE GENDER AND LIVING IN RURAL AREA (P < 0.01).

PRESENT STUDY ATTEMPTS TO EMPIRICALLY TESTS WHICH OF THE SAID TWO MODELS BETTER EXPLAINS THE MINDFULNESS-WELL-BEING RELATIONSHIP. TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN ADULTS WERE ASSESSED ON THE SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF THE SAID CONSTRUCTS. INITIALLY WE TESTED THE MEDIATIONAL MODEL ASSUMING THAT THE USE OF ER (COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL & SUPPRESSION) WOULD MEDIATE THE MINDFULNESS-SWB RELATIONSHIP. THIS MODEL WAS FOUND TO YIELD A GOOD FIT TO THE DATA WITH SOME MINOR MODIFICATION. THE TEST OF ALTERNATIVE MODEL THAT ASSUMES ER AS AN ANTECEDENT FACTOR IN MINDFULNESS – WELL-BEING RELATIONSHIP WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE A GOOD FIT TO THE DATA. THE COMPARISON OF BOTH MODELS REVEALED THAT LATER MODEL YIELDED A BETTER FIT COMPARED TO THE FORMER MODEL. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE ALTERNATE POSSIBILITY THAT BETTER EMOTION REGULATION HELPS TO ATTAIN A MINDFUL STATE WHICH IN TURN ENHANCES HEALTH/WELL-BEING APPEARS TO BE A BETTER EXPLANATORY MODEL THAN THE CONVENTIONAL MODEL WHICH ASSUMES THAT MINDFULNESS EXERTS BENEFICIAL HEALTH EFFECTS THROUGH ITS EMOTION REGULATORY EFFECT.

THE PARENTS OF 134 CHILDREN AGED 5-7 YEARS RESPONDED TO HYPOTHETICAL SOCIAL SCENARIOS EXAMINING A) THEIR GENERAL TENDENCY TO ATTRIBUTE HOSTILE INTENT TO THE AMBIGUOUS BEHAVIOUR OF OTHERS, AND B) HOSTILE ATTRIBUTIONS MADE SPECIFICALLY TO THEIR CHILD. CHILDREN'S OWN ATTRIBUTIONS OF HOSTILE INTENT AND LEVELS OF EXTERNALISING SYMPTOMATOLOGY WERE ASSESSED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT CHILD EXTERNALISING SYMPTOMS WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH A GENERALISED TENDENCY TOWARDS THE ATTRIBUTION OF HOSTILE INTENT AND CHILD-SPECIFIC HOSTILE ATTRIBUTIONS IN PARENTS. CHILD EXTERNALISING SYMPTOMS WERE THEMSELVES ASSOCIATED WITH HOSTILE ATTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE CHILD.

93,EATING DISORDERS AND THE BRAIN,LASK B;FRAMPTON I;LASK B;FRAMPTON I,NA,,,,,2011,,,"WHY IS THE BRAIN IMPORTANT IN EATING DISORDERS? THIS GROUND-BREAKING NEW BOOK DESCRIBES HOW INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED NEUROSCIENTIFIC APPROACHES ARE REVEALING MUCH ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE BRAIN IN EATING DISORDERS. EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT DISCUSSES HOW UNDERLYING BRAIN ABNORMALITIES AND DYSFUNCTION MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND HELP IN THE TREATMENT OF THESE SERIOUS DISORDERS. THE FIRST CHAPTER EXPLAINS THE IMPORTANCE OF A NEUROSCIENCE PERSPECTIVE FOR CLINICIANS. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMMON EATING DISORDERS, THEN CHAPTERS ON WHAT WE KNOW OF THEM FROM STUDIES OF NEUROIMAGING, NEUROPSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROCHEMISTRY. THE MYSTERIOUS PHENOMENON OF BODY IMAGE DISTURBANCE IS THEN DESCRIBED AND EXPLAINED FROM A NEUROSCIENCE PERSPECTIVE. AN OVERVIEW OF NEUROSCIENCE MODELS OF EATING DISORDERS LEADS TO A CHAPTER ON A NEW AND COMPREHENSIVE EXPLANATORY MODEL OF ANOREXIA NERVOSA. THE FOLLOWING TWO CHAPTERS OFFER A CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE, FOCUSING ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF A NEUROSCIENCE PERSPECTIVE FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES, THE SECOND PROVIDING DETAILS OF CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF NEUROSCIENCE UNDERSTANDING. THE FINAL CHAPTER LOOKS TO THE FUTURE. THIS BOOK SUCCINCTLY REVIEWS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ALL THESE ASPECTS OF EATING DISORDER NEUROSCIENCE AND EXPLORES THE IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT. IT WILL BE OF GREAT INTEREST TO ALL CLINICIANS (PSYCHIATRISTS, PSYCHOLOGISTS, NURSES, DIETICIANS, PEDIATRICIANS, PHYSICIANS, PHYSIOTHERAPISTS) WORKING IN EATING DISORDERS, AS WELL AS TO NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCHERS.

SUCH RESEARCH IS CRITICAL, AS SUICIDE FREQUENCY AND ETIOLOGY, AS WELL AS CARE-SEEKING IN THE CASE OF DISTRESS, DIFFER CONTEXTUALLY AND BY SUB-GROUPS WITHIN A POPULATION. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY OF ITS KIND TO EXPLORE THE DUAL PERSPECTIVES OF BOTH HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS REGARDING SUICIDE IN HAITI. WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED, IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS BETWEEN MAY AND JUNE 2011 WITH EIGHT BIOMEDICAL HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND 16 LAY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS, DRAWING ON INTERPRETIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS, ADDRESSED THEMES INCLUDING PERCEIVED SUICIDE FREQUENCY, VERACITY OF SUICIDAL IDEATION CLAIMS, PERCEIVED CAUSAL FACTORS, RELIGIOUS CONSTRUCTS RELATED TO SUICIDE, AND SUPPORT RESOURCES FOR SUICIDALITY. COMPARED TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS, HEALTHCARE WORKERS UNDERESTIMATED THE FREQUENCY OF SUICIDE AND WERE LESS LIKELY TO INTERPRET SUICIDE-RELATED CLAIMS AS REPRESENTING TRUE INTENT. RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVES INFLUENCED ATTITUDES TOWARD SUICIDE, ALBEIT IN DIFFERENT WAYS: CHRISTIAN CONCERN WITH THE AFTERLIFE RESULTED IN SUICIDE BEING UNACCEPTABLE AND SINFUL, WHILE VODOU EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORKS DISPLACED BLAME AND STIGMA AWAY FROM SUICIDAL INDIVIDUALS. HEALTHCARE WORKERS' FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE SUICIDE AS A SERIOUS PROBLEM SUGGESTS THAT THE FORMAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY ILL-EQUIPPED TO RESPOND TO SUICIDE-RELATED NEEDS.

PREVALENCE STUDIES REPORT HIGHER RATES OF PTS IN FORCIBLY DISPLACED CHILDREN (FDC). CURRENT EVIDENCE DERIVING MAINLY FROM CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES IS UNABLE TO MAKE CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS. GIVEN RISING RATES OF FORCIBLE DISPLACEMENT REPORTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR) IN 2014, THERE IS INCREASING NEED TO DETERMINE THE BEST POLICIES AND PRACTICE FOR ENGAGING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF FDC. METHODS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IDENTIFIES (1) LONGITUDINAL RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS AND CORRELATES FOR PTS AND (2) ITS NATURAL HISTORY IN FDC, CONTRIBUTING TO RESEARCH IDENTIFYING VULNERABLE SUBGROUPS AND MALLEABLE FACTORS FOR PTS AND UNDERSTANDING ITS NATURAL HISTORY. NO META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED DUE TO HETEROGENEITY; RESULTS WERE ANALYZED THROUGH NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS. RESULTS: ELEVEN LONGITUDINAL STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED. ALL BUT ONE WERE PROSPECTIVE COHORT DESIGNS. THEY IDENTIFIED PREVALENCE RATES BETWEEN 20\% AND 48.7\% AT BASELINE, 10\% AND 48.3\% AT 1 YEAR (K = 7), 18\% AND 48\% AT 2-3 YEARS (K = 2), 8\% AND 38\% AT 6 YEARS (K = 2), AND 35\% AT 12 YEARS USING NINE MEASUREMENT METHODS IN SEVEN INDEPENDENT SAMPLES. EVIDENCE FROM MULTIPLE ASSOCIATIONS SUPPORTED THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS: EXPOSURE TO TRAUMATIC STRESSORS OR OTHER STRESS, OLDER AGE, AND PRIOR PSYCHOPATHOLOGY. EVIDENCE PREDOMINANTLY SUPPORTED THE STABILITY OF PTS WITH SOME DECLINE. CONCLUSION: WHILE RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION GIVEN SMALL OR UNREPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES, THEY SUGGEST REGULAR MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED FOR FDC, WHO ARE A VULNERABLE SUBGROUP WITH VARIABLE ONSET AND REMISSION. RISK ASSOCIATIONS WITH PRIOR PSYCHOPATHOLOGY ALSO SUGGEST THAT SCREENING UPON ARRIVAL MAY BE ADVISABLE FOR EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION.",,,POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS; FORCIBLY DISPLACED CHILDREN; MENTAL HEALTH;; TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES; LONGITUDINAL STUDY; COHORT STUDY; NATURAL; HISTORY; PTSD

NEVERTHELESS, FEW LMIC STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED INDIVIDUALS WITH PSYCHOSIS IN NON-URBAN, NON-HOSPITAL SETTINGS. USING THE PERSPECTIVE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS, WE AIMED TO UNCOVER DESCRIPTIONS OF PEOPLE WITH PSYCHOSIS IN A RURAL SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNITY AND ILLUMINATE THE POTENTIAL COMPLEXITIES OF THEIR HELP-SEEKING JOURNEYS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF 40 KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND SEVEN FOCUS GROUPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS (TRADITIONAL LEADERS, TRADITIONAL HEALERS, RELIGIOUS LEADERS, HEALTH CARE NURSES, HEADS OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, SCHOOLTEACHERS, COMMUNITY CAREGIVERS) IN A RURAL ZULU COMMUNITY (VULINDLELA). THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE DATA WAS PERFORMED USING THE INDUCTIVE ANALYSIS APPROACH. RESULTS: INTERVIEWEES DISCUSSED 32 INDIVIDUALS WITH PROBABLE PSYCHOSIS IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND PROVIDED RICH DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR SYMPTOMS. A COMPLEX PICTURE OF HELP-SEEKING BEHAVIOR, PRIMARILY INVOLVING INFORMAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMERGED. OVER HALF OF THE REPORTED CASES HAD NO CONTACT WITH FORMAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE COURSE OF THEIR HELP-SEEKING JOURNEY; WHILE MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS NEVER ATTENDED A HOSPITAL AND ONLY 1 IN 8 ACCESSED A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF INFORMAL CARE PROVIDERS IN LMICS AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH ON MENTAL ILLNESS AND LOCAL PROVIDERS IN NON-HOSPITAL CONTEXTS.
