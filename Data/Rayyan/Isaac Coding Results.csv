Although these constructs have been linked to relatives' attributions for patient problems, little research has yet evaluated attributions for specific types of problems. This study examined event-specific attributions (i.e., attributions specifically for either disorder-related [dr] or non-dr problems) in relatives of patients with anxiety disorders. Relatives made more illness attributions (attributing problems to a patient's disorder) than controllable attributions (attributing problems to factors controllable by patients) for dr events, with the reverse pattern for non-dr events. Criticism and hostility were associated primarily with controllability attributions for non-dr events. In contrast, the presence of eoi was associated with illness attributions for non-dr events. Family-based interventions for anxiety disorders might need to focus on relatives' controllability attributions for a broad range of patient behaviors and on reducing tendencies to attribute non-dr problems to patients' disorders.

Different cultural belief systems on the causes of mental illness and their treatment have to be taken into consideration. The purpose of this study is to explore perceived causes of depression among farsi-speaking migrants and refugees from afghanistan and iran, which represent two groups with a shared cultural heritage, but originating from very different regimes of mobility. Both are among the largest migrant groups coming to germany over the past decade. Design/methodology/approach in total, 50 iranian and 50 afghan migrants and refugees, who arrived in germany in the past 10 years were interviewed, using an unlabeled vignette presenting signs and symptoms of depression. The answers were then coded through inductive content analysis. Findings among iranians, there was a more significant number of causal attribution to western psychiatric concepts, whereas afghans attributed depression more often to the experience of being a refugee without referring to psychological concepts. These differences in attribution did, however, not affect the desire for a social distance toward depressed people. Nonetheless, a higher number of years spent in germany was associated with less desire for social distance toward persons with depression among afghans, but not among iranians. Originality/value to the best of the knowledge, this is the first study examining perceived causes of depression with farsi-speaking migrants in germany and contributes to understanding tendencies in the perception of depression in non-western migrant groups.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,REFUGEES;EXPLANATORY MODELS;DEPRESSION;STIGMA;CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION;;PSYCHOLOGIZATION;Social Desirability;Germany;Iran,,

(2) are perceived causes of mental distress actually related to treatment preferences? (3) are ems influenced uniquely by ethnic group, or are they more closely associated with the presence of common mental disorders? Method: from february 2003 to january 2004, we investigated ems for mental distress among 79 bangladeshi, 85 black caribbean, and 97 white british people who reported difficulties in the preceding month. Ems were assessed by a self-report checklist that inquired about the identity, causes, timeline, consequences, controllability, and preferred treatments for mental distress. Common mental disorders were assessed using the clinical interview schedule (revised). Results: independent of ethnic group, people with common mental disorders were more likely to give spiritual causal explanations (odds ratio [or] = 3.1, 95\% ci = 1.9 to 4.9), to report behavioral (or = 2.2, 95\% ci = 1.3 to 3.8) and financial consequences (or = 3.3, 95\% ci = 1.8 to 6), and to prefer complementary treatments (or = 4.6, 95\% ci = 2.3 to 9.1). Compared with black caribbean and white british subjects, bangladeshi subjects more often gave spiritual or physical causal explanations. Compared with white british subjects, bangladeshi and black caribbean subjects preferred medical and spiritual treatments, whereas white british subjects, as compared with the other 2 ethnic groups, preferred self-management and social treatments. Causal explanations did not always relate to the corresponding treatment preferences. Conclusions: ems can be assessed by a simple checklist, show variations by ethnic group, and are associated with common mental disorders. Identifying ems may strengthen the assessment of common mental disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,NA;Mental Disorders,,

Abnormal lateralization of the functional language network, increased reliance on visual processing areas, and increased posterior brain activation have all been reported in asd and proposed as explanatory models of language difficulties. Nevertheless, inconsistent findings across studies have prevented a comprehensive characterization of the functional language network in asd. The aim of this study was to quantify common and consistent patterns of brain activation during language processing in asd and typically developing control (td) participants using a meta-analytic approach. Activation likelihood estimation (ale) meta-analysis was used to examine 22 previously published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri)/positron emission tomography studies of language processing (asd: n = 328; td: n = 324). Tasks included in this study addressed semantic processing, sentence comprehension, processing figurative language, and speech production. Within-group analysis showed largely overlapping patterns of language-related activation in asd and td groups. However, the asd participants, relative to td participants, showed: (1) more right hemisphere activity in core language areas (i.e., superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus), particularly in tasks where they had poorer performance accuracy; (2) bilateral mtg hypo-activation across many different paradigms; and (3) increased activation of the left lingual gyrus in tasks where they had intact performance. These findings show that the hypotheses reviewed here address the neural and cognitive aspects of language difficulties in asd across all tasks only in a limited way. Instead, our findings suggest the nuances of language and brain in asd in terms of its context-dependency.

This article presents a theoretical framework for better understanding such clinical cases, developed from examples of psychiatric practice in different cultures. The theory is based on two meanings of the concept of culture, an elaboration of the universality-relativity dichotomy, and a view of the work of mental health care providers as involving three components: (1) building a trusting relationship with the patient; (2) making a diagnosis and treatment plan; and (3) carrying out treatment that is acceptable and meaningful to the patient.

rayyan-984748667,The Discrepancy Between Perceived And Estimated Absolute Risks Of Coronary Heart Disease In Middle Eastern Women: Implications For Cardiac Rehabilitation,2018,1,1,NA,,,,,GHOLIZADEH L,,,,,"Coronary heart disease (chd) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. While primary and secondary prevention programmes indisputably reduce the burden of chd and increase quality of life, they are often underused, particularly by women and ethnic minorities. Lower referral rate, inaccessibility of services, being female, lack of support, insufficient income, impaired health literacy, inappropriateness of the programmes and the failure of health care organisations and programmes to provide culturally competent care to diverse racial, ethnic and cultural groups are some contributing factors. The use of health care services also appears to be influenced by perceived vulnerability to chd. An individual's subjective judgment about the characteristics and severity of a risk, that is the perception of risk, and causal attributions play an important role in responding to risk. Attitudes towards chd risk and the associated risk factors such as smoking, diet, physical activity and obesity are mainly underpinned within cultural beliefs and practices. The value placed on adopting favourable health seeking behaviours, and a willingness to comply with medical advice are also often related to cultural beliefs, values and experiences. There is, therefore, a need to explore chd risk perception in culturally diverse populations. Understanding these risks can help health practitioners tailor health messages and services more effectively to facilitate behaviour change in target groups, which is critical in the management of chd. This thesis aimed to explore the relationship between middle eastern women's perceived and estimated absolute risk of chd to inform primary and secondary prevention programmes. This thesis comprised two discrete, yet interrelated studies and employed a mixed method to elicit the participants' perception of general and personal chd risk. Focus groups were used to capture the collective views of migrant turkish, persian and arab middle eastern women about their perceptions of the risk of developing chd, causal attributions and risk reducing behaviours. The three main themes that emerged from the focus group discussions were: (a) middle eastern women underestimated the risk of chd; (b) stress is a pervasive factor in the lives of middle eastern women; and (c) middle eastern women face many barriers to reduce their risk of chd. Participants' biological, behavioural and socio-economical risk factors showed that the study participants were at increased chd risk due to high prevalence of some risk factors such as high blood cholesterol level, obesity, inactivity and psychological distress. Yet, the participants underestimated their personal chd risk and perceived themselves to be at increased risk of psychological disorders such as depression. Further, those who perceived some level of increased chd risk attributed it more to their psychological status rather than life style factors. Underestimation of the risk, inaccurate causal attributions, low socio-economic status and low health literacy accompanied with lack of culturally and linguistically competent programmes to assist women in protecting their cardiovascular health are some identified barriers to chd risk reducing behaviours among middle eastern women. Findings of this study have significant implications for cardiac rehabilitation services to develop culturally and linguistically competent programmes to communicate middle eastern women while taking into account cultural differences in beliefs and traditions, socioeconomic status and health literacy. These differences should be considered in cr design, implementation and evaluation.

Avoiding risks or buying time can set a different lifetime pattern. Changing unhealthy behaviors in adolescence would have a broad impact on society, reducing the burdens of disease, injury, human suffering, and associated economic costs. Any program designed to prevent or change such risky behaviors should be founded on a clear idea of what is normative (what behaviors, ideally, should the program foster?), descriptive (how are adolescents making decisions in the absence of the program?), and prescriptive (which practices can realistically move adolescent decisions closer to the normative ideal?). Normatively, decision processes should be evaluated for coherence (is the thinking process nonsensical, illogical, or self-contradictory?) And correspondence (are the outcomes of the decisions positive?). Behaviors that promote positive physical and mental health outcomes in modern society can be at odds with those selected for by evolution (e.g., early procreation). Healthy behaviors may also conflict with a decision maker's goals. Adolescents' goals are more likely to maximize immediate pleasure, and strict decision analysis implies that many kinds of unhealthy behavior, such as drinking and drug use, could be deemed rational. However, based on data showing developmental changes in goals, it is important for policy to promote positive long-term outcomes rather than adolescents' short-term goals. Developmental data also suggest that greater risk aversion is generally adaptive, and that decision processes that support this aversion are more advanced than those that support risk taking. A key question is whether adolescents are developmentally competent to make decisions about risks. In principle, barring temptations with high rewards and individual differences that reduce self-control (i.e., under ideal conditions), adolescents are capable of rational decision making to achieve their goals. In practice, much depends on the particular situation in which a decision is made. In the heat of passion, in the presence of peers, on the spur of the moment, in unfamiliar situations, when trading off risks and benefits favors bad long-term outcomes, and when behavioral inhibition is required for good outcomes, adolescents are likely to reason more poorly than adults do. Brain maturation in adolescence is incomplete. Impulsivity, sensation seeking, thrill seeking, depression, and other individual differences also contribute to risk taking that resists standard risk-reduction interventions, although some conditions such as depression can be effectively treated with other approaches. Major explanatory models of risky decision making can be roughly divided into (a) those, including health-belief models and the theory of planned behavior, that adhere to a ``rational'' behavioral decision-making framework that stresses deliberate, quantitative trading off of risks and benefits; and (b) those that emphasize nondeliberative reaction to the perceived gists or prototypes in the immediate decision environment. (A gist is a fuzzy mental representation of the general meaning of information or experience; a prototype is a mental representation of a standard or typical example of a category.) Although perceived risks and especially benefits predict behavioral intentions and risk-taking behavior, behavioral willingness is an even better predictor of susceptibility to risk taking-and has unique explanatory power-because adolescents are willing to do riskier things than they either intend or expect to do. Dual-process models, such as the prototype/willingness model and fuzzy-trace theory, identify two divergent paths to risk taking: a reasoned and a reactive route. Such models explain apparent contradictions in the literature, including different causes of risk taking for different individuals. Interventions to reduce risk taking must take into account the different causes of such behavior if they are to be effective. Longitudinal and experimental research are needed to disentangle opposing causal processes-particularly, those that produce positive versus negative relations between risk perceptions and behaviors. Counterintuitive findings that must be accommodated by any adequate theory of risk taking include the following: (a) despite conventional wisdom, adolescents do not perceive themselves to be invulnerable, and perceived vulnerability declines with increasing age; (b) although the object of many interventions is to enhance the accuracy of risk perceptions, adolescents typically overestimate important risks, such as hiv and lung cancer; (c) despite increasing competence in reasoning, some biases in judgment and decision making grow with age, producing more ``irrational'' violations of coherence among adults than among adolescents and younger children. The latter occurs because of a known developmental increase in gist processing with age. One implication of these findings is that traditional interventions stressing accurate risk perceptions are apt to be ineffective or backfire because young people already feel vulnerable and overestimate their risk. In addition, research shows that experience is not a good teacher for children and younger adolescents, because they tend to learn little from negative outcomes (favoring the use of effective deterrents, such as monitoring and supervision), although learning from experience improves considerably with age. Experience in the absence of negative consequences may increase feelings of invulnerability and thus explain the decrease in risk perceptions from early to late adolescence, as exploration increases. Finally, novel interventions that discourage deliberate weighing of risks and benefits by adolescents may ultimately prove more effective and enduring. Mature adults apparently resist taking risks not out of any conscious deliberation or choice, but because they intuitively grasp the gists of risky situations, retrieve appropriate risk-avoidant values, and never proceed down the slippery slope of actually contemplating tradeoffs between risks and benefits.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Public Policy;Adolescent;Decision Making,,

The understanding of vpt can be improved by introducing explicit causal explanations in the interactions involving autistic children. Moreover, the use of social robots can help autistic children improve their social skills. We present a retrospective study with kaspar, a humanoid social robot specifically designed to interact with children with asd, which aims to define the initial protocol for a study on the effect of causal explanation in vpt provided by kaspar. To this end, we investigate in which scenarios causal explanations, provided either by researchers or by kaspar, contribute substantially to the child's understanding of vpt. The results have helped us identify multiple interaction categories that benefit from causal explanation. We have used these results in order to define new interaction games that benefit from causal explanations.

While ethnic minorities disproportionately suffer from diabetes, there is little research investigating the socio-cultural context of diabetes within refugee communities. While genetics may predispose an individual to a particular disease, the physical and social environments lead to its embodiment. Given a history of trauma and migration, this biocultural research uses a multi-theoretical framework to explore diabetes embedded in the larger experiences of cambodian americans in southern new england. In addition to established risk factors, the research investigates the contribution of mental health, the status syndrome (those with lower status are at risk due to limited control and decreased social integration) and cultural consonance (the ability to live according to the standards of a culture) to diabetes risk. Data were elicited from adults in semi-structured interviews on explanatory models of diabetes, and in structured interviews targeting the experience of established and additional culturally mediated risk factors for diabetes. Cambodian american cultural models of diabetes are compared to a general american sample. Grounded theory was used to elicit themes for semi-structured interview data. Correlation and logistic regression analyses were used for structured interview data. Both the cambodian and general american samples drew on biomedically accepted causes and symptoms of diabetes; yet, cambodians discussed mental health associations, while the general american sample focused on physical symptoms. Cambodian americans experience a variety of health concerns in the context of past experiences in cambodia and current experiences in urban america. Family history and symptoms of depression are key predictive variables of diabetes status for this sample of cambodian americans. As an adaptation to the reality of life in the united states, diabetes may be used as an idiom of distress. The findings suggest target areas for the long-term health of refugees with overlapping, chronic physical and mental health concerns.

The present research examined the perceived utility of emotion, or the degree to which emotions are perceived to be useful in goal attainment. Due to the novelty of this construct, in four separate projects i examine: (a) the measurement of perceived utility of emotion and the stability of this construct across time and contexts (projects 1-2); (b) the relation between perceived utility of emotion in attributions and behavioral intentions (project 3); and (c) the potential importance of perceived utility of emotion in interpersonal sensitivity and depression (project 4). Findings from the present research suggest that perceived utility of emotion plays a role in individual differences, including depression, even after taking into account felt affect.

rayyan-984748684,The Uses Of The Outline For Cultural Formulation Of The Dsm-Iv: From Case Conceptualization To Treatment Plan,2010,1,1,NA,,,,,DINH MHN,,,,,"Article i. Traumatic amputation: a case of laotian indignation and injustice. Culture is an essential variable of diagnosis and treatment. A cultural perspective draws attention to the social context within which symptoms arise, are given meaning, and are managed. Ethno-cultural work on illness narratives suggests that most people can provide culturally-based explanations for their symptoms. While these explanations are inconsistent with biomedical theory, they relieve patient distress by allowing the patient to create meaning for symptoms. Exploring the characteristics, context, and antecedents of the symptoms enables the patient to convey them to the clinician who may have a divergent explanation of sickness. This case study uses the outline for cultural formulation of the dsm-iv created for clinicians to elicit a narrative account of the illness experience from the patient. Our study examines how the patient, a laotian used social indignation ('khuâm khum khang') as an explanatory model for his ailment. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after having undergone a traumatic amputation. In the process of explaining his illness through a cultural idiom, the patient was able to reveal both personal and collective meaning of repressed anger and frustration, expressing them in a context that was acceptable to him. This cultural idiom allowed the patient to reflect upon the structure of the health care system and the specific context in which symptoms and their possible origins are recounted and explored. It also clarified to the treating clinicians some categories of experience and causal explanations that did not fit easily with western biomedical and psychiatric understanding. The case study illustrates how a cultural approach to illness from the patient’s perspective offers a reflexive stance on the clinician-patient interaction that allows for better patient care. Key words. Culture, meaning, cultural idiom, explanatory model, dsm-iv outline for cultural formulation, social indignation, clinician-patient interaction article 2. Impact of the use the dsm-iv outline for cultural formulation on the dynamics of multidisciplinary case conferences in mental health. The growth of cultural pluralism in north american society has required the mental health community to show a higher level of cultural sensitivity. Mental health professionals must not only be aware of the social and historical context of their clientele, but also of their profession. Clinical evaluations provide the information for clinical care. This information must be examined in a cultural-sensitive framework for assessment and case formulation that permits an accurate diagnosis across the cultural boundaries of both patient and mental-care professional. The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., dsm-iv; american psychiatric association, 1994) sets forth an outline for cultural formulation (cf). It instructs clinicians not only on how to elicit culturally relevant clinical material, but also on how to assess the importance of the diverse cultural perspectives of patients and their families, thus increasing usefulness of their own cultural knowledge in treatment. This study is a conversational analysis of the nature and application of knowledge within a clinical, interdisciplinary context. It uses an expanded version of the cf as a framework, in which the discursive practices of mental health professionals are evolving. From a symbolic interactionist perspective, it examines the way different disciplines interpret and conceptualize cultural elements and the implications of this framework for interdisciplinary collaboration of assessment, treatment plan and care.

Design: representative population-based survey. Setting: random digit dialling telephone survey of non-institutionalised individuals aged =14 years in germany. Participants: representative sample of 1000 individuals. Main outcome measures: interview-based assessment of prevention support, problem identification, causal attributions and responsibility beliefs regarding obesity. Results: support for obesity prevention with a focus on behavioural change in children (89.7%) and provision of information in adults (82.2%) was substantial, but regulations were less supported (42.2%). Predictors of prevention support were attributing causes of obesity to the food environment and lack of physical activity, greater problem identification, societal responsibility beliefs and sociodemographic characteristics including female gender and higher age. An information deficit concerning the definition, prevalence, and environmental and genetic risk factors was identified. Conclusion: results show a high public readiness for obesity prevention with a focus on individual behavioural change, but not for regulations. Addressing specific information deficits regarding the definition, prevalence and causes of obesity could further enhance the public's understanding of obesity and help to establish obesity prevention measures.

Data-analysis was based on a thematic methodology.; Results: pre-treatment patients were struggling in an existential crisis, feeling existentially insecure about their social identity, the causes, consequences and management of their illness; experiencing difficulties identifying and expressing stress-related cognitions, emotions and feelings, and low bodily and emotional self-contact; often leading to avoidant coping, making these individuals highly stress-vulnerable. Post-treatment, the overall change was conceptualized as increased existential security, defined by patients being more self-confident; more clarified with their social identity, the nature, management and future prospects of their illness; generally using more flexible coping strategies to reduce their daily stress experiences. Four related subthemes were identified contributing to increased existential security: 1) more secure illness perceptions - feeling existentially recognized as ""really"" ill, 2) enhanced relaxation ability - using mindfulness techniques, 3) increased awareness - connecting differently to mind and body 4) improved ability to identify and express needs and feelings of distress - more active communicating. Patients suggested that mindfulness therapy could be expanded with more time for group-discussions followed by additional individual therapy.; Conclusion: generally, treatment positively influenced the patients' illness perceptions, stress-experiences, body- and self-awareness, coping strategies, self-image, social identity and social functioning. However, patients identified potentials for treatment improvements, and they needed further treatment to fully recover. (Copyright © 2014 elsevier inc.

As social support is linked with recovery from depression and a lower likelihood of experiencing future episodes of depression, it is important to understand factors that influence an individual's decision to seek social support. Aims: the present study examined depressed individuals' own attributions for their depressive symptoms (i.e. Personal attributions), perceptions of a friend's attributions for these symptoms (i.e. Perceived attributions), and the depressed individuals' willingness to seek social support from that friend. Method: eighty-six individuals experiencing at least mild depressive symptoms completed self-report measures of personal attributions, perceived attributions, and a social support seeking intentions scale. Results: participants' own attributions for depressive symptoms were unrelated to their willingness to seek social support. In contrast, perceived biological attributions were related to greater help-seeking intentions, whereas perceived psychological attributions were associated with lower support seeking intentions. Conclusions: these results suggest that decisions to seek social support are more influenced by perceptions of others' beliefs about depression than one's own beliefs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,DEPRESSION;CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS;SOCIAL SUPPORT;RELATIONSHIPS,,

However, obesity is often attributed to oversimplified and stigmatizing causal factors such as laziness, lack of willpower, and failure to take personal responsibility for one’s health. Understanding of the causal factors that contribute to obesity among people with obesity may affect their weight management efforts. The current study explored associations between causal attributions for obesity and long-term weight loss, as well as examined potential changes in attributions with weight reduction. The 16-item causal attributions for obesity scale (rated 1-7) was administered to 178 patients seeking behavioral/pharmacological weight-loss treatment. Causal attributions and weight were assessed at baseline, after 14 weeks of a low-calorie diet, and again at weeks 24 and 52 of a subsequent randomized trial (i.e., 66 weeks total). Logistic and linear regression examined effects of baseline causal attribution ratings on weight loss. Higher baseline ratings of personal responsibility attributions predicted 38% reduced odds of achieving = 10% weight loss at week 52 (p = 0.02). Causal attribution ratings did not change over time or correlate continuously with weight change. Thus, attributing obesity to a failure of personal responsibility may impair long-term weight management efforts for individuals seeking =10% weight loss. Targeted techniques are needed to reduce patients’ stigmatizing beliefs about the causes of obesity.

Our main aim was to characterize the relationship between mental state understanding and the broader autism phenotype, early in childhood. An eye-tracker was used to capture anticipatory looking as a measure of false beliefs attribution in 3-year-old children with a family history of autism (at-risk participants, n = 47) and controls (control participants, n = 39). Unlike controls, the at-risk group, independent of their clinical outcome (asd, broader autism phenotype or typically developing), performed at chance. Performance was not related to children’s verbal or general iq, nor was it explained by children 'missing out' on crucial information, as shown by an analysis of visual scanning during the task. We conclude that difficulties with using mental state understanding for action prediction may be an endophenotype of autism spectrum disorders.

They also completed self-report measures of social difficulties and psychological functioning. Their parents provided information on social competence and clinical presentation.

We investigated this hypothesis in a unique sample of families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy. Methodsone hundred eighty-one people with epilepsy and 178 biologic relatives without epilepsy completed a self-administered survey. In people with epilepsy, felt stigma was assessed through the epilepsy stigma scale (ess), scored 1-7, with higher scores indicating more stigma and >4 indicating some felt stigma. Felt stigma related to having epilepsy in the family was assessed through the family epilepsy stigma scale (fess), created by replacing epilepsy with epilepsy in my family in each ess item. Genetic attribution was assessed through participants' perceptions of the (1) role of genetics in causing epilepsy in the family, (2) chance they had an epilepsy-related mutation, and (3) (in people with epilepsy) influence of genetics in causing their epilepsy. Resultsamong people with epilepsy, 22\% met criteria for felt stigma (ess score >4). Scores were increased among individuals who were aged 60years, were unemployed, reported epilepsy-related discrimination, or had seizures within the last year or >100 seizures in their lifetime. Adjusting for other variables, ess scores in people with epilepsy were significantly higher among those who perceived genetics played a medium or big role in causing epilepsy in the family than in others (3.4 vs. 2.7, p=0.025). Only 4\% of relatives without epilepsy had felt stigma. Scores in relatives were unrelated to genetic attribution. Significancein these unusual families, predictors of felt stigma in individuals with epilepsy are similar to those in other studies, and stigma levels are low in relatives without epilepsy. Felt stigma may be increased in people with epilepsy who believe epilepsy in the family has a genetic cause, emphasizing the need for sensitive communication about genetics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,GENETICS;EPIDEMIOLOGY;SURVEY;GENETIC ATTRIBUTION;STIGMA;Epilepsy;Causality,,

Evidence to support one or the other evolutionary theory of mental illness will be hard to come by. I have argued elsewhere that, owing to its necessarily historical nature, it will be difficult to arrive at credible causal explanations. As for the direct clinical utility of an evolutionary theory, i cannot see how knowing that psychotic symptoms might have been advantageous in times long gone is of huge benefit to patients or, for that matter, clinicians, and i think that current and possibly future treatment strategies work just as well without taking recourse to an evolutionary perspective. Even if evidence were available, there remains a considerable explanatory gap-why do some (young) people who experience non-clinical psychotic symptoms develop a full-blown psychotic illness with significant functional impairment?

The authors examined the impact of this approach with a 10-year comparison of public endorsement of treatment and prejudice. Method: the authors analyzed responses to vignettes in the mental health modules of the 1996 and 2006 general social survey describing individuals meeting dsm-iv criteria for schizophrenia, major depression, and alcohol dependence to explore whether more of the public 1) embraces neurobiological understandings of mental illness; 2) endorses treatment from providers, including psychiatrists; and 3) reports community acceptance or rejection of people with these disorders. Multivariate analyses examined whether acceptance of neurobiological causes increased treatment support and lessened stigma. Results: in 2006, 67\% of the public attributed major depression to neurobiological causes, compared with 54\% in 1996. High proportions of respondents endorsed treatment, with general increases in the proportion endorsing treatment from doctors and specific increases in the proportions endorsing psychiatrists for treatment of alcohol dependence (from 61\% in 1996 to 79\% in 2006) and major depression (from 75\% in 1996 to 85\% in 2006). Social distance and perceived danger associated with people with these disorders did not decrease significantly. Holding a neurobiological conception of these disorders increased the likelihood of support for treatment but was generally unrelated to stigma. Where associated, the effect was to increase, not decrease, community rejection. Conclusions: more of the public embraces a neurobiological understanding of mental illness. This view translates into support for services but not into a decrease in stigma. Reconfiguring stigma reduction strategies may require providers and advocates to shift to an emphasis on competence and inclusion.

The comorbidity of both groups of symptoms considerably affects health, and the literature refers that they are risk factors for the development of suicidal ideation. Objective: evaluate an explanatory model of depression and anxiety as suicidal ideation predictors in peruvian adults. Methods: a descriptive, cross-sectional study with a predictive design, with a sample of 566 peruvian adults who agreed to answer self-report measures on depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. A structural equation model was performed to evaluate the explanatory model. The patient health questionnaire-2, the generalized anxiety disorder-2, and the suicidal ideation frequency inventory were applied. To assess the fit of the model, structural equation modeling and a robust weighted least squares estimator adjusted far mean and variance were used. Results: depression (beta = 0.52, p = 0.01) and anxiety (beta = 0.23, p = 0.03) predict suicidal ideation in a statistically significant way.

The tendency to offer attributions for good events that highlighted their undesirable aspects was strongly associated with bdi scores, while the tendency to offer attributions for bad events that highlighted their desirable aspects was negatively associated with bdi scores. It is concluded that attributional investigations of depression should not limit attention just to attributions per se, but should include how the events themselves are experienced.

Gps recorded co morbidities and clinical findings. Patients filled out a diary for up to 4 weeks on their symptoms, illness perception and related behaviour. The chi-square test was used to compare proportions between groups and the mann-whitney u or kruskal wallis tests were used to compare means.; Results: three thousand one hundred six patients from 12 european countries were included. Eighty-one per cent (n = 2530) of the patients completed the diary. Patients were feeling unwell for a mean of 9 (sd 8) days prior to consulting. More than half experienced impairment of normal or social activities for at least 1 week and were absent from work/school for a mean of 4 (sd 5) days. On average patients felt recovered 2 weeks after visiting their gp, but 21% (n = 539) of the patients did not feel recovered after 4 weeks. Twenty-seven per cent (n = 691) reported feeling anxious or depressed, and 28% (n = 702) re-consulted their gp at some point during the illness episode. Reported illness duration and days absent from work/school differed between countries and regions (north-west versus south-east), but there was little difference in reported illness course and related behaviour between health care systems (direct access versus gate-keeping).; Conclusion: illness course, perception and related behaviour in lrti differ considerably between countries. These finding should be taken into account when developing international guidelines for lrti and interventions for setting realistic expectations about illness course. (© the author 2014.

To date. The literature has focused primarily on language, sociocultural factors, and residence status when discussing access barriers to this part of the health care system. However, little attention has been paid to cultural differences in explanatory models of addictive behaviour. This is surprising when we consider the important role played by popular knowledge in a population's perceptions of and responses to illnesses, including their causes, symptoms, and treatment. In the present study, we examined explanatory models of addictive behaviour and of mental disorders in 124 native german und russian-german youth and compared these models to those observed in an earlier study of 144 german and turkish youth. We employed the free listing technique german and to compile the terms that participating subjects used to describe addictive behaviour. Subsequently, we examined how a subset of our study population assigned these terms to the respective disorders by means of the pile sort method. Although the explanatory models used by the german and russian-german youth in our study were surprisingly similar, those employed by turkish youth did not make any fundamental distinction between illegal and legal drugs (e.g. Alcohol and nicotine). German and russian-german youth regarded eating disorders as ``embarrassing'' or ``disgraceful'' but turkish youth did not. Unlike our german and russian-german subjects, the turkish youth did not classify eating disorders as being addictive in nature. Moreover, medical concepts crucial to a proper understanding of dependence disorders (e.g. The term ``physical dependence'') were characterised by almost half of our turkish subjects as useless in describing addictions. These findings show that it is impossible to translate medical or everyday concepts of disease and treatment properly into a different language without considering the connotations and implications of each term as it relates to the respective culture. Terms that are central to western medical models of disease may otherwise be misunderstood, misinterpreted, or simply rejected. (C)2007 elsevier masson sas.

rayyan-984748705,The Dark Side Antecedents And Emotional Consequences Of Leader Aggression: The Moderating Roles Of Leader Self-Control And Subordinate Attributions,2022,1,1,NA,,,,,FERNANDES E,,,,,"Building upon prior work in the fields of workplace occupational health and leadership, this study examined the antecedents and consequences of leadership aggression in the workplace, specifically, this study was concerned with understanding the dark side dispositions as predictors of abusive supervision and supervisor ostracism, as well as the outcomes of such aggression on subordinates' emotional affect. Using an approach-avoidance framework and socio-analytic theory, this study proposed that leaders' composite scores on 'moving against others' or 'approach' personality dispositions would be related to abusive supervision, whereas leaders' composite scores on 'moving away from others' or 'avoidance' personality tendencies would be related to supervisor ostracism. The moderating role of leaders' self-control in the relationship between these personality dispositions and leadership aggression constructs was also examined. Past research has found a relationship between leadership aggression constructs and specific subordinate emotions. For example, ferris et al. (2016) found that subordinates experienced the emotions of 'anger' or 'anxiety' depending upon the specific supervisor aggression (abusive supervision or supervisor ostracism) experienced. This research study expanded upon these findings by examining the personality antecedents of these supervisor aggression constructs. Since hogan development survey (hds; 2009) supports the underlying factor structure of 'moving away from people', 'moving towards people' and 'moving against people' (horney, 1950), it was the most appropriate assessment to measure approach (or 'moving against') and avoidance (or 'moving away') tendencies. Additionally, socio-analytic theory (r. Hogan, 1996) states that such tendencies manifest under conditions of poor self-regulation. Therefore, this study also examined the moderating role of trait self-control in the relationship between leaders' personality dispositions and leadership aggression. The moderating role of subordinates' causal attribution tendencies in the relationship between subordinates' experiences of supervisor aggression (abusive supervision and supervisor ostracism) and emotional outcomes of anger and anxiety was also tested. Specifically, the study proposed that the relationship between abusive supervision and anger would be stronger for individuals with low versus high performance promotion tendencies. Alternatively, the relationship would be weaker for individuals with low versus high injury initiation attribution tendencies. For supervisor ostracism, it was proposed that low harm-inducing motive attributions will result in a stronger relationship between supervisor ostracism and anxiety. The proposed hypotheses were tested through a multi-source dyadic model where leaders and subordinate dyads were recruited via amazon's mturk platform. Results revealed that 'moving against others' was positively related to abusive supervision. A moderating effect of 'moving away from others', self-control and supervisor ostracism was evidenced, however, it was not in the anticipated direction. While moderation effects for causal attribution tendency were not found, the results demonstrated main effects in the direction proposed. Limitations of this study included low sample size, use of mturk data and a covid-19 history effect among others. Even so, it provided important implications in understanding how leaders' dark side personality may impact subordinates' perception of leadership aggression. Understanding these relationships provided a first step in helping leaders manage such tendencies. Future research should replicate this model in field settings and under more stable organizational conditions.

Findings support the hypothesis for adaptive attitudes and intentions to reduce drinking, especially for heavy social drinkers. However, none of the experimental messages produced any reduction in actual daily drinking among either heavy or moderate drinkers. It was also found that high fear messages, and to a lesser extent low fear messages, reduced the normally positive correlation between intentions to reduce drinking and actual drinking reduction (throughout a 1-mo follow-up period).

The aim of this study was to examine the causal attributions and illness perceptions of 51 black african and caribbean people with non-affective psychosis and their associations with psychosis symptoms. Black service users with non-affective psychosis most frequently attributed mental health problems to psychosocial factors, though spiritual, biological and substance abuse explanations were also provided. Endorsing a psychosocial explanation for psychosis was associated with less severe negative symptoms. More negative or threatening illness perceptions were correlated with greater negative, general and overall symptom severity in psychosis.

Methods: data were collected between february and. June 2006 in a probability sampled population-based survey of 3047 adults in alberta, canada. Measures included a depression stigma scale. Correlates of stigma were examined using bivariate analyses and linear regression modeling methods separately for men and women. Results: in multivariate linear regression models, correct identification of depression in a case description and agreement with health professionals about treatments were associated with lower stigma scores, regardless of gender. Endorsing gp/family doctors and taking medications as being the best help for depression was negatively associated with stigma scores in women. In men, endorsing family/friends as the best help for depression or ``don't know'' the best help for depression was positively associated with stigma scores. Women who had family/friends with depression had less stigma than women who did not have. This was not observed in men. Among male participants, significant interactions between being a health professional, having close family/ friends with depression and reporting ``weakness of character'' as a causal factor for depression were found. Conclusions: improving mental health literacy may be one of the promising ways to reduce stigma associated with depression. Personal contacts with individuals with depression may have positive effects on stigma in women. Mental health education and promotion should clarify misconceptions about causes, treatments and risk factors for depression. Gender differences related to stigma should be considered in stigma reduction initiatives. (C) 2007 elsevier b.v.

In figure 5a of this article, the g (95% ci) values for langdon et al (2010) and lee et al (2004) have been corrected. Corrections are provided and have been made online] an influential psychological model of persecutory delusions proposed that they are caused by a bias towards holding others responsible for negative events (an externalising attributional bias), preventing the individual from becoming aware of underlying low self-esteem. An early version of the model predicted self-esteem would, therefore, be preserved in people with these delusions, but a later version suggested it would be unstable, and that there would be a discrepancy between explicit and implicit self-esteem, with the latter being lower. We did a comprehensive meta-analytical test of the key predictions of this model and assessed the quality of evidence. We searched pubmed from jan 1, 1994, to july 31, 2018, and collated systematic reviews of the defensive model’s predictions in relation to persecutory delusions. We also searched psycinfo, medline, embase, and web of science for articles published from jan 1, 2012, to sept 10, 2016. Cross-sectional data from case-control, longitudinal, or experimental studies that examined self-esteem or the externalising attributional bias in individuals diagnosed as having schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were eligible for meta-analyses of group differences if at least 50% of participants with psychosis also had current persecutory delusions. Uncontrolled and longitudinal studies were included in meta-analyses of correlations and self-esteem instability, respectively. Study and outcome quality were assessed with the agency for healthcare research and quality assessment tool, and a modified version of grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation, respectively. The study protocol is registered with prospero, number crd42016032782. We screened 3053 records, examined 104 full-text reports, and included 64 eligible studies. Consistent with the predictions of both versions of the model, paranoia severity in psychosis was positively correlated with the degree of externalising attributional bias (21 studies involving 1128 individuals; r=0·18, 95% ci 0·08 to 0·27, with moderate quality evidence). People with persecutory delusions also had a greater externalising attributional bias than non-clinical individuals (27 studies involving 1442 individuals; g=0·48, 95% ci 0·23 to 0·73) and depressed individuals (ten studies involving 421 individuals; g=1·06, 0·48 to 1·63), and people with psychosis without persecutory delusions (11 studies involving 480 individuals; g=0·40, 0·12 to 0·68), all based on moderate quality evidence. Contrary to the predictions in the early version of the model, paranoia severity in psychosis was negatively correlated with explicit self-esteem (23 studies involving 1866 individuals; r=–0·26, 95% ci –0·34 to –0·17, with high quality evidence). People with persecutory delusions also had lower explicit self-esteem than non-clinical individuals (22 studies involving 1256 individuals; g=–0·88, 95% ci –1·10 to –0·66, with high quality evidence) and explicit self-esteem similarly low to that in people with psychosis without persecutory delusions (11 studies involving 644 individuals; g=–0·26, –0·54 to 0·02, with moderate quality evidence).

The intention to perform a behavior is hypothesized to be determined by two influences--the attitude toward performing the behavior and the social norm perceived from significant others about performing the behavior or not. These influences develop from a set of beliefs that an individual holds about the outcomes of performing the behavior. Any additional variables are conceptualized as external to the model and thought to influence intention indirectly, through beliefs, attitude, and/or social norm). In this study, blame for problems (an attribution) and three characteristics of the helpseeker, distress level, sex, and past counseling experience, were external variables. The factors which predicted intention and the manner in which variables influenced the decision to seek help were identified and the responses of groups expressing differential intentions were compared. A sample of 180 undergraduates were administered inventories assessing their perceptions of helpseeking, style of blame, and distress level. In the analyses, two attitude factors were found; one, a generalized attitude toward helpseeking, and the other an affective response, reflecting how comfortable or unpleasant performance of the behavior was perceived to be. More discomfort was associated with seeking help for the problem of adjustment than for the problem of depression. Both attitude factors and social norm were found to predict helpseeking intention. The external variables did not predict intention, with the exception of past counseling, which was significant if one was experiencing a problem of depression. The beliefs about the positive and negative outcomes of seeking help were rated as to the probability and desirability of their occurrence. Differences were found between the responses of groups which were contrasted--intenders and nonintenders, and males and females. Intenders believed that obtaining help would result in positive outcomes that they desired, with little likelihood that negative outcomes would result more than did nonintenders. Females perceived that the positive outcomes of seeking help were much more desirable than males did.

Posttraumatic growth and complicated grief were assessed using standardized questionnaires, and qualitative and quantitative results were then merged using data transformation methods. Results: in total 42 themes of meaning reconstruction were abstracted from oral material. It was shown that sense-making themes ranged from causal explanations to complex philosophical beliefs about life and death. Benefit-finding themes contained thoughts about personal improvement as well as descriptions about social actions. Significant correlations were found between the extent of sense-making and posttraumatic growth scores (rs = 0.54, rs = 0.49; p < 0.01), especially when the death was traumatic or unexpected (rs = 0.67, rs = 0.63; p < 0.01). However, analysis revealed no significant correlation with complicated grief. Overall results corroborate meaning reconstruction themes and the importance of meaning reconstruction for posttraumatic growth.

The participants (n = 787) were presented with 44 potential causal explanations for bn and were asked to rate the importance of each in the development of this condition on a 5-point rating scale ('unimportant' to 'extremely important'). Principal component analysis identified four causal components. These were interpreted as corresponding to (1) socio-cultural pressure, (2) eating and dieting practices, (3) family dynamics, and (4) psychological vulnerability. A high degree of consistency in the mean ratings for the four causal components was observed among the professional groups. However, important differences were found between the professional and the lay respondents in their beliefs about the role of socio-cultural pressure, eating and dieting practices, and family dynamics in the development of bn. The congruence in beliefs among the professionals groups would contribute to the ease of interdisciplinary collaboration required in the multi-modal treatment approach to bn. However, the differences observed between the professional and lay groups may have implications for educational and preventative strategies for bn.

Attributions are causal explanations people make for specific behaviors, characteristics, occurrences, or differences. Research has found that genetic attributions are related to numerous biopsychosocial phenomena (e.g., perceptions about one's own health, attitudes toward others) that impact individuals and societies. Unfortunately, often these causal attributions are linked to problematic outcomes. For example, genetic attributions for the etiology of illness are often associated with decreased personal control and well-being. Additionally, genetic attributions for group differences are related to psychological essentialism (i.e., the belief that members of a group all share a deep, underlying ``essence''), which, in turn, tends to be associated with stereotyping and prejudice. With the following brief overview of theoretical and empirical work related to genetic attributions, i discuss how instructors can incorporate discussions of this important concept into their psychology courses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,GENETIC ATTRIBUTIONS;ATTRIBUTION THEORY;CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS;;PSYCHOLOGICAL ESSENTIALISM;IMPLICIT THEORIES;Self Psychology,,

Alfred binet challenged krafft-ebing's orthodoxy by explaining fetishism in terms of associative learning, to which krafft-ebing's response was that only those with a hereditary taint would be vulnerable.

These perceptions can predict adjustment and quality of life in patients with single conditions. However, multimorbidity (i.e. Patients with multiple long-term conditions) is increasingly prevalent and a key challenge for future health care delivery. The objective of this research was to develop a valid and reliable measure of illness perceptions for multimorbid patients. Methods: candidate items were derived from previous qualitative research with multimorbid patients. Questionnaires were posted to 1500 patients with two or more exemplar long-term conditions (depression, diabetes, osteoarthritis, coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Data were analysed using factor analysis and rasch analysis. Rasch analysis is a modern psychometric technique for deriving unidimensional and intervally-scaled questionnaires. Results: questionnaires from 490 eligible patients (32.6\% response) were returned. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five potential subscales `emotional representations', `treatment burden', `prioritising conditions', `causal links' and `activity limitations'. Rasch analysis led to further item reduction and the generation of a summary scale comprising of items from all scales. All scales were unidimensional and free from differential item functioning or local independence of items. All scales were reliable, but for each subscale there were a number of patients who scored at the floor of the scale. Conclusions: the multipies measure consists of five individual subscales and a 22-item summary scale that measures the perceived impact of multimorbidity. All scales showed good fit to the rasch model and preliminary evidence of reliability and validity. A number of patients scored at floor of each subscale, which may reflect variation in the perception of multimorbidity. The multipies measure will facilitate research into the impact of illness perceptions on adjustment, clinical outcomes, quality of life, and costs in patients with multimorbidity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,NA,,

Wu (see record [rid]2014-01708-001[/rid]). The authors welcome cho and wu’s suggestion that the study of auditory verbal hallucinations (avhs) could be improved by contrasting and testing more explanatory models. However, the authors have some worries both about their criticisms of inner speech-based self-monitoring (iss) models and whether their proposed spontaneous activation (sa) model is explanatory. Cho and wu rightly point out that some phenomenological aspects of inner speech do not seem concordant with phenomenological aspects of avh. Cho and wu argue that iss models are no better than sa models at explaining the specificity of avhs to specific voices and content; we would argue that an iss model, with recognition that inner speech is more complex than one’s own voice speaking in the first person, explains more than the sa model, because it explains why voices with a specific phenomenology are experienced in the first place, as opposed to more random auditory experiences that might be expected from sa in auditory cortex. It should be pointed out that auditory cortical regions are not the only areas reported to lead to avhs when directly stimulated. Admittedly, it is possible that stimulation of anterior cingulate cortex (acc) could have distal effects, also stimulating auditory cortical regions.

Methods a narrative review was conducted based on a search in medline/pubmed up to january 1(st), 2020, and iterative retrieval of references from recent reviews and clinical trials. Expert opinion the contextual model of the common factors of psychotherapy provides a powerful perspective on psychotherapy, antidepressants, and psychedelics, as well as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (mdma) and ketamine. It aligns well with key tenets of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.

We identify five questions that need to be asked about symptoms, including what kind of constructs they are, how we should describe them, and what causal explanations they support. We then examine how three different theoretical frameworks address these questions: the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, the symptom-network-modeling approach, and the cambridge model of symptom formation. We show that the assumptions these frameworks make affect the kinds of theoretical models they support and the research approaches they advocate. When symptoms are viewed as empirical observations, the focus of inquiry is directed elsewhere. However, when symptoms are understood as complex constructs in their own right, that are themselves built on certain theoretical assumptions, then understanding them becomes crucial to theoretical progress. We conclude by calling for greater focus on research that unpacks the constructs underlying symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS;MENTAL DISORDERS;CLASSIFICATION,,

rayyan-984748737,[To Err Is Human? Interests Of Chaotic Models To Study Adult Psychiatric Disorders And Developmental Disorders].,2016,1,1,L'ENCEPHALE,,,,,BENAROUS X and COHEN D,,,,,"Background: many clinical and biological parameters have nonlinear chaotic fluctuations. These variations result in unexpected pseudo-random transitions. In these models, few risk factors can lead to unexpected phenomena if oscillations and self-reinforcement patterns occur. Complex rhythms could ease the ability of a physiological system to adapt and react quickly to a constantly changing environment.; Objectives: it has been proposed that several psychiatric disorders and developmental disorders are characterized by a loss of complex rhythm in favor of a more organized pattern. We examine evidence to support these assumptions in literatures.; Methods: we performed a literature review of the main computerized databases (medline, pubmed) and manual searches of the literature concerning non dynamic rhythms in time series analysis, in adults with psychiatric disorder and children with developmental disorder. These results were interpreted through a developmental approach that highlights the role of the learning process in the emergence of abilities.; Results: analysis of clinical scores and electroencephalographic data have found that subjects with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, tested over a time series, have lower chaotic rhythms compared with healthy subjects. Growing children share several properties of a complex system: the interdependence of developmental axes (motor, emotional, language, social skills), multiple hierarchical levels (i.e. Genetic, biological, environmental, and cultural), the two-way transactions between the child and his environment, and the sensitivity to initial conditions. This could explain the difficulty to predict the emergence of abilities or the long-term prognosis of impairment in children. This limitation is not only due to errors in the explanatory model or the lack of explanatory variable. It is also caused by instability, which is a core characteristic of a chaotic system.; Conclusion: the study of chaotic rhythms in time-series clinical and nonclinical data (e.g. Eeg, functional neuroimaging) could improve the prediction of an acute event, such as relapse of mood disorder. Moreover, the complex rhythms in children may play a major part in synchronicity during interactions with a caregiver, held as essential for later development of self-regulation skills, such as emotional stability.

Although there is evidence that the association among these two variables generalizes across cultures and disabilities, other findings suggests that the chinese have a more negative attributional style than their western counterparts, which could alter the relationship between attributional style and depression among chinese with sci. Likewise, the construct of acceptance of disability (ad) and its correlates has been covered extensively in western samples with sci, but has received virtually no attention in eastern samples. The present study examined these variables within the context of sci in a chinese sample. Participants were 158 chinese individuals with sci who completed a battery of self-report measures of demographic, injury-related, and psychosocial variables. Cluster analysis results suggested three distinct clusters based on attributional style (positive, neutral, negative). Those in the positive attributional style cluster were more likely to have tetraplegia than paraplegia, but exhibited less functional disability and depressive symptoms, and higher ad than the negative cluster. Path analysis indicated that higher functional disability predicted both more negative attributional style and higher depressive symptomology; attributional style did not directly predict depression, in contrast to findings from previous studies. Higher depressive symptomology was found to predict lower ad, consistent with existing research.

A comprehensive range of literature examining unexplained chest pain, and published over the last three decades, was thus reviewed finding that, although unexplained chest pain has been examined as a psychological phenomenon for over 100 years, explanatory models have emerged only in the last two decades. Neither psychophysiological nor psychodynamic models have been significantly advanced. Only cognitive-behavioural models have been explicitly derived to explain and manage the condition, and require further refinement to address conceptual and methodological limitations. Studies assessing treatment efficacy suggest cognitive-behavioural therapy as a first-line therapy, but have failed to establish whether the approach is acceptable and effective in routine care. Comprehensive psychological understanding of unexplained chest pain, and its management, is therefore developing but is far from complete.

This assumption is mostly based on findings of preclinical studies and epidemiological research.

Epidemiological research also found evidence of malnutrition in people with dementia. Considering this and the fact that omega-3 pufa cannot be synthesised by humans, omega-3 pufas might be a promising treatment option for dementia. Objectives to assess the efficacy and safety of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) supplementation for the treatment of people with dementia.

There was no evidence of a benefit from omega-3 pufas on cognitive function when measured at six months with the alzheimer's disease assessment scale - cognitive subscale (standardised mean difference (smd) -0.02, 95\% confidence interval (ci) -0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high quality evidence) or mini-mental state examination (mean difference (md) 0.18, 95\% ci 1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on activities of daily living (smd -0.02, 95\% ci -0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence). There was also no effect at six months of treatment on severity of dementia measured with the clinical dementia rating - sumof boxes (md-0.00, 95\% ci -0.58 to 0.57; 542 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on quality of life measured with the quality of life alzheimer's disease scale (md -0.10, 95\% ci -1.28 to 1.08; 322 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence). There was no difference at six months on mental health measured with the montgomery-asberg depression rating scale (md-0.10, 95\% ci -0.74 to 0.54; 178 participants: 1 study; high quality of evidence) or the neuropsychiatric inventory (smd 0.10, 95\% ci -0.07 to 0.27; 543 participants; 2 studies; high quality of evidence). One very small study showed a benefit for omega-3 pufas in instrumental activities of daily living after 12 months of treatment (md -3.50, 95\% ci -4.30 to 2.70; 22 participants; moderate quality evidence). The included studies did not measure specific cognitive function. The studies did not report adverse events well. Two studies stated that all adverse events were mild and that they did not differ in overall frequency between omega-3 pufa and placebo groups. Data from one study showed no difference between groups in frequency of any adverse event (risk ratio (rr) 1.02, 95\% ci 0.95 to 1.10; 402 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) or any serious adverse event (rr 1.05, 95\% ci 0.78 to 1.41; 402 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence) at 18 months of treatment. Authors' conclusions we found no convincing evidence for the efficacy of omega-3 pufa supplements in the treatment of mild to moderate ad. This result was consistent for all outcomes relevant for people with dementia. Adverse effects of omega-3 pufas seemed to be low, but based on the evidence synthesised in this review, we cannot make a final statement on tolerability. The effects on other populations remain unclear.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Dementia,,

However, no research on the specific attributions that parents of children with asd make for their child’s behaviour could be found. The current study is an exploration of parental attributions within the asd population. Fifty-nine families participated in this study. Analysis identified a tendency for parents to generalise attributions about asd-related behaviour to misbehaviour. In addition, analysis identified a tendency to believe that the child’s positive behaviour is more stable and controllable by the child than misbehaviour. A relationship was found between parental autistic traits and a tendency for the parent to attribute responsibility to themselves for asd-related behaviour and misbehaviour.

Adolescents engaging in risk behaviors and experiencing interpersonal violence, substance use, and pregnancy are at high risk for psychological distress.; Method: secondary analysis of data collected via a control randomized trial among mexican american females (aged 14-18 years; n = 461) experiencing high-risk sexual behavior, interpersonal violence, and sexually transmitted infection was conducted with comparisons of psychological distress by pregnancy status.; Results: at study entry, 46.4% (n = 214) self-reported ever experiencing pregnancy (ever-pregnant) while 53.6% (n = 246) self-reported never experiencing pregnancy (never-pregnant). Adolescents reporting ever-pregnancy status were older and school dropouts. However, adolescents reporting never-pregnancy experienced higher sexual risk behaviors, substance use, interpersonal violence, and psychological distress than those reporting ever-pregnancy. A higher proportion of ever- versus never-pregnant adolescents were born in mexico and preferred spanish language indicating less acculturation.; Conclusions: findings support the need for mental health literacy concerning psychological distress with consideration of implications of acculturation among adolescents experiencing high-risk sexual behavior, interpersonal violence, and substance use. More never- than ever-pregnant adolescents were attending school, presenting opportunities for implementation of health promotion strategies within community health settings for mental health literacy.

Given the high association between depression and anxiety, we examined simple and partial correlations between ratings of depression, anxiety, the asq, and the ats. With the exception of internality, attributions covaried with depression and anxiety but were not specific to depression. In contrast, overgeneralization was related specifically to depression but not anxiety. Discussion centers on whether there is a specific relation between depression and cognitions and the possibility that self-evaluation processes following negative events may be more relevant to depression than explanations concerning the causes of the event.

rayyan-984748749,"Ethnomedicine And Ethnobotany Of Fright, A Caribbean Culture-Bound Psychiatric Syndrome",2010,1,1,JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE,,,,,QUINLAN MB,,,,,"Background: ``fright'' is an english-speaking caribbean idiom for an illness, or ethnomedical syndrome, of persistent distress. A parallel ethnopsychiatric idiom exists in the french antilles as sesisma. Fright is distinct from susto among hispanics, though both develop in the wake of traumatic events. West indian ethnophysiology (ethnoanatomy) theorizes that an overload of stressful emotions (fear, panic, anguish or worry) causes a cold humoral state in which blood coagulates causing prolonged distress and increased risks of other humorally cold illnesses. Methods: qualitative data on local explanatory models and treatment of fright were collected using participant-observation, informal key informant interviews and a village health survey. Ethnobotanical and epidemiological data come from freelist (or ``free-list'') tasks, analyzed for salience, with nearly all adults (n = 112) of an eastern village in dominica, and a village survey on medicinal plant recognition and use (n = 106). Results: along with prayer and exercise, three herbs are salient fright treatments: gossypium barbadense l., lippia micromera schauer, and, plectranthus [coleus] amboinicus [loureiro] sprengel. The survey indicated that 27\% of village adults had medicated themselves for fright. Logistic regression of fright suffering onto demographic variables of age, education, gender, parental status and wealth measured in consumer goods found age to be the only significant predictor of having had fright. The probability of having (and medicating for) fright thus increases with every year. Conclusions: while sufferers are often uncomfortable recalling personal fright experiences, reporting use of medicinal plants is less problematic. Inquiry on fright medical ethnobotany (or phytotherapies) serves as a proxy measurement for fright occurrence. Cross-cultural and ethnopharmacology literature on the medicinal plants suggests probable efficacy in accord with dominican ethnomedical notions of fright. Further, the cultural salience and beliefs about these medicines may give these medications extra psychoneuroimmune (i.e. Mind-body) benefits, or placebo-like effects, for this stress-related folk illness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,"NA;Caribbean Region;Medicine, Traditional",,

A case is made for analysing causal attributions as a way to gain a better understanding of these processes. The leeds attributional coding system (stratton et al., 1988) was used to analyse all the attributions made early in therapy by eight families which included biological, step- and adoptive parents. Some 1799 attributions made by family members during ten therapy sessions were identified and their attributional dimensions recorded. Both parents and children used attributional patterns consistent with blaming the child and there was evidence of the occurrence of an `attributional discrepancy', found previously in families of abuse, with more personal and controllable causes being applied to the child. Considering attributional dimensions in combination proved an effective way of identifying incidences of characterological blaming. Limited changes in the form of these attributions, by focusing on change in just one of the dimensions, could convert them into more benign and productive contributions to family conversations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Our search yielded 105 scientific texts on jinn and their relationship with mental disorders, including 47 case reports. Among the case reports a definite biomedical diagnosis was provided in 66\% of the cases, of which 45.2\% involved a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Fully 10 of 16 hallucinating patients experienced multimodal hallucinations.

Methods: specifically, we apply this synthesis to ptsd. The framework of active inference offers an embodied and embedded lens through which to understand neuronal mechanisms, structures, and processes of cognitive function and dysfunction. In turn, this offers an explanatory model of how healthy mental functioning can go awry due to psychopathological conditions that impair inference about our environment and our bodies. In this context, auditory phenomena-known to be especially relevant to studies of ptsd and schizophrenia-and traditional models of auditory function can be viewed from an evolutionary perspective based on active inference. Results: we assess and contextualise a range of evidence on audition, stress, psychosis, and ptsd, and bring some existing partial models of ptsd into multilevel alignment. Conclusions: the novel perspective on ptsd we present aims to serve as a basis for new experimental designs and therapeutic interventions that integrate fundamentally biological, cognitive, behavioural, and environmental factors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,"POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD);PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;AUDITION;;EMBODIMENT;EVOLUTION;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",,

Methods: based on a selective review of literature, we examine evidence that cultural and personal explanatory models can contribute to the pathogenesis, symptomatology, and chronicity of medically unexplained symptoms and functional somatic syndromes. Results: in the contemporary world, culture involves flows of information, roles, and institutions that offer individuals multiple models for understanding illness. Cultural models include 1) explanatory models, which make causal attributions and impute specific mechanisms or processes of pathophysiology; 2) prototypes, which are salient images or exemplars drawn from personal experience, family, friends, mass media, and popular culture that are used to reason analogically about one's own condition; and 3) implicit models and procedural knowledge that may be difficult to articulate because they are embedded in body practices and ways of experiencing distress. Symptom attributions and explanations can participate in vicious circles of symptom amplification that give rise to culture-specific varieties of panic disorder, hypochondriacal worry, and medically unexplained symptoms. Conclusions: clinical research using the methods of experimental cognitive and social psychology as well as community-based ethnographic and ecological research are needed to advance our understanding of the impact of personal and cultural models on somatic distress. Nevertheless, the current state of knowledge on social and cultural dimensions of somatic syndromes suggests a typology of forms of psychosomatic and sociosomatic looping that has implications for the nosology of somatoform disorders.

We carried out a study of chinese patients'(n = 118) and relatives' (n = 78) views of illness severity, attribution of cause, concern about developing illness, and effect of schizophrenia on family planning. A comparison sample of english-survey respondents was also obtained, using the same series of questions (n = 42 patients, n = 127 relatives). Fewer chinese patients and family members rated schizophrenia as very severe (33\%) than did the predominantly north american respondents (67\%, p<0.0001). The pattern of attribution of cause differed between samples (p<0.0001), favoring environmental alone in the chinese sample (52\%), with a low frequency of genetics alone (9\%). Although comparatively fewer chinese respondents were very concerned about developing schizophrenia themselves or about the risk of illness in their families (21\%), this high level of concern was more common in family members (28\%). Finally, chinese respondents were somewhat less likely to indicate that schizophrenia impacted on family planning decisions (31\%) than were english-survey respondents (45\%, p = 0.02). The descriptive findings contribute to understanding schizophrenia in china. The comparative findings must be regarded as preliminary, since differences in demographics could influence results. The present findings suggest that understanding patients' and families' attributions of cause of schizophrenia may be important for developing a shared model of illness in order to decrease stigmatization, and improve therapeutic alliances.

According to the revised hopelessness theory, a specific attributional style for negative events is also a risk factor for unipolar depression and may be relevant for bipolar disorder as well, according to recent research. Furthermore, the equivalent attributional style for positive events may be a risk factor for mania. Until now, however, little was known about the associations between such vulnerability factors; therefore, this study investigates whether personality-like traits related to 'hypomanic personality' and rigidity may also act as vulnerability factors for attributional style. Using a 2-year prospective design we found that, in young adults (n = 196), risk for bipolar disorder predicted more stable and global attributions for positive events and expectations of more positive consequences from such events. In contrast to our predictions, rigidity did not predict a depressogenic attributional style for negative events. These results suggest that personality-like traits might significantly contribute to the development or maintenance of attributional styles which are known risk factors for the onset of acute mood episodes.

Through a national survey, the current study investigated beliefs and attitudes toward people with schizophrenia and depression among the general public in taiwan. A random-digit-dialing telephone-based cross-sectional survey was administered to taiwanese adults aged 20-64 years (n = 1600). The data were analyzed through binary logistic regressions to test for differences between these disorders in causal beliefs, stereotypes, emotional reactions, desire for social distance, and help-seeking behavior. The results revealed that respondents were more concerned with biogenetic causal explanations for people with schizophrenia than for those with depression. Significantly more respondents perceived people with schizophrenia as more likely to be unpredictable and violent toward others. A similar trend was observed for the desire for social distance. For both disorders, respondents were significantly more likely to express compassion than to express anger toward the person described in the vignette. Respondents also expressed more desire for social distance from someone like the vignette who have received psychiatric treatment. These findings provide useful directions for the implementation of optimal psychoeducation among such communities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,STIGMA;HELP-SEEKING;CAUSAL BELIEFS;EMOTIONAL REACTIONS;MENTAL HEALTH;Schizophrenia;Taiwan,,

Design - first, i offer a new analytic framework for understanding the ``adhd process.'' The proposed framework breaks adhd diagnoses down into three stages: the informal diagnosis, the formal diagnosis, and treatment. This approach reveals certain racial trends in the adhd literature. Second, i use the 2007 national health interview survey (total n = 75,764) to address racial differences. Findings - i find that blacks are less likely to hold a formal adhd diagnosis than whites. Third, nested logistic models reveal that this racial difference is not explained by health insurance status, family income, or family educational level. New explanatory models for the black white difference in adhd should stray from a strict reliance on the ``unmet need'' discourse, and instead focus on other factors that may affect the decision-making process in diverse families.

The present study explored the knowledge, causal beliefs, and help-seeking behaviors of south asian migrants in hong kong about dementia. It also investigated existing community barriers related to dementia knowledge and help-seeking. Design we conducted a qualitative study from a purposive sample of 38 older people and family caregivers from india, pakistan, and nepal who lived in hong kong. Focus groups and individual in-depth interviews were used to gather information, while thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data. Results five main themes were identified: normalization with stigmatization of dementia; spiritual and psychosocial attributions of dementia; familial responsibility despite potential caregiving burden; uncertainties versus openness to professional care; and barriers and opportunities in dementia literacy. Ethnic minorities recognized dementia as a disease of normal aging or a mental disorder. They also perceived spiritual and psychosocial factors as their main causes. While participants recognized the potential burden of dementia caregiving, families were their first point of help-seeking, as many of them expressed contrasting feelings of confidence or doubt toward professional services. Utilization of health education strategies, together with collaboration with community leaders, could address the barriers to dementia literacy. Conclusions this is the first study to explore how ethnic minorities in asia perceive dementia and its related help-seeking behaviors in their communities. South asian migrants in hong kong have a limited understanding of dementia and may experience delays in obtaining relevant community services. While culture influenced their knowledge, health education may address their misperceptions and help-seeking behaviors toward dementia. Culture- and language-specific programs could also improve dementia knowledge and health service access.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,DEMENTIA LITERACY;MENTAL HEALTH;ETHNIC;RACIAL MINORITIES;SOUTH;ASIANS;CULTURE;Dementia;Hong Kong,,

To identify the attributional style of clients presenting with anger management problems and to determine whether this differs from that of depressed clients and non-clients. Design. A between-subjects design was used. The independent variable was the nature of the clinical group: anger management problems, clinically depressed, and non-clinical controls. The six dependent variables were: level of depression, level of self esteem, explicit attributional style, implicit attributional style, level of anger, and responses to an anger provoking incident. Method. The study compared 20 adults with anger management problems with a group of 17 adults with depression and 20 adults with no mental health problems. The groups were matched for age, gender and employment status. Attributional style was measured using the internal, personal and situational attribution questionnaire (ipsaq; kinderman & bentall, 1996) and the pragmatic inference task (pit; winters & neale, 1985). Results. There was a significant interaction between group, attribution and event on the ipsaq. Conclusions. The results indicate an attributional style for clients with anger management difficulties that is similar to those clients with depression for negative events, but is similar to controls for positive events. In terms of further research, other studies of this type are recommended to see if these findings are stable. If this proves to be the case, then longitudinal studies are recommended to determine the cause-effect relationship. In addition, studies are advised to determine the links between depression and anger difficulties and how this informs us about the attributional style in mental health problems more broadly.

It is thus not surprising that explanatory models, which look at the meaning of illness for those suffering from it, have been widely used within the mental health field. This paper considers the significance of explanatory models and presents a study comparing the explanatory models of mental ill health used by urban women in low-income groups and local health care practitioners in zambia. To measure mental ill-health status, an instrument recommended by the world health organization was used - the self reporting questionnaire, 20 items (srq 20). To obtain explanatory models, kleinman's classic eight questions were adapted. The terms used by the practitioners to define and explain the mental health problems of women in low-income groups were `stress and depression', with these two concepts being used interchangeably. In contrast, the phrase most frequently used by the women was `problems of the mind'. The professionals regarded the experience of depression itself as a manifestation of ill health. For the women, however, only the physical symptoms were defined as ill health. There was a common agreement, however, that the women's socioeconomic situation as a major causal factor. Both groups identified the home environment as a key determinant, particularly the quality of marital relationships. Greater awareness of explanatory models may have beneficial effects on mental health policy and planning, both at national levels (where recognition of the true prevalence and burden of mental ill health should have an impact on public health policy) and at the level of local implementation (where training of health professionals to take patients' explanatory models into account might contribute towards the diagnosis of mental health problems).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,NA;Women's Health,,

Number of reasons given of each type was measured. The reasons were further analysed in terms of a number of attributional dimensions. Results. Mood-disturbed participants (anxious and mixed) provided more pro relative to con reasons for negative events and more con relative to pro reasons for positive events.

Psychomotor deficiencies comprised the most frequent disability category associated with disabled adults, while autism was the most frequent disability related to disabled children. Participants considered that the inclusion of physically disabled children (compared to children with intellectual disabilities) in public schools has a more positive effect on non-disabled children.

Population at-risk for psychological distress. Yet, research to inform the mental health of umis is scant and existing studies often lack scientific rigor. This study used the socio-ecologic framework and the minority stress model, as well as context-sensitive methodology and respondent driven sampling (rds) to identify the prevalence of psychological distress, mental health disorders, and relevant cultural and contextual concepts of distress, among umis living in high-risk neighborhoods near the california-mexico border region. Design: this study was a multi-stage project that included formative research, pilot testing, and a cross-sectional study that used respondent driven sampling (rds) as a sampling and data analysis methodology. Data for the rds study was obtained from clinical interviews with 248 umi adults of mexican origin residing in north san diego county. Primary mental health outcome measures included the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (m.i.n.i.), the brief symptom inventory (bsi-53), and the bradford symptom inventory (absi). An adapted version of the diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders (dsm) 5th edition cultural formulation interview (cfi) was used for the assessment of cultural and contextual concepts of distress.. Results: overall, 41% of umis met criteria for clinically significant psychological distress, with significant differences found for sex, age, and marital status. Additionally, 22% of umis met criteria for one or more mental health disorder based on dsm diagnosis, with the most prevalent disorders being major depressive disorder (mdd: 14%) and generalized anxiety disorder (gad: 7%). Pertaining to cultural concepts of distress, 24% of umis reported a lifetime prevalence of nervios and 12% reported a lifetime prevalence of ataque de nervios, with the most common causal attributions for nervios and ataque de nervios being family conflict (20%). Moreover, 82% of umis reported experiencing significant distress as a result of their undocumented status, which was found to be associated with significant migration-related loss, clinically significant psychological and somatic symptoms, and a negative effect on identity and self-esteem. Conclusions: umis are a population at risk of psychological distress given the multiple contextual stressors that these immigrants face. Debates on programs and policies pertaining to umis are complex and multifaceted, and divisiveness on immigration and welfare reform in the u.s. Is long-standing. Tenacious grassroots efforts, both, in mexico and in the u.s., are necessary to influence policy aimed to allocate funding to increase access to culturally and contextually responsive interventions aimed to address the complex mental health needs of this vulnerable population. It is the responsibility of both mexico and the u.s. To work collaboratively in the development of programs and policies to prevent the negative consequences of inadequate access and to protect the human rights of mexican immigrants looking for more promising futures.

Childhood sexual abuse and high schizotypy increase the risk further. The mechanisms involved remain unclear, and this limits psychological therapies. In three linked studies, we examined the role of two candidate mechanisms—external attribution and cognitive fusion. Study 1 examined these processes in a general population sample and showed that paranoia, psychotic-type experiences, and linked distress were higher in cannabis-users, and mediated by cognitive fusion but not external attribution. Study 2 examined the impact of established risk factors in general population cannabis-users and showed that external attribution and cognitive fusion partially or fully accounted for the effects of childhood sexual abuse and schizotypy on paranoia, psychotic-type experiences and linked distress. Study 3 examined these same processes in a clinical population of people with psychosis and found that external attribution and cognitive fusion partially or fully accounted for the impact of gender, age of first use, sexual abuse and schizotypy.

Previous studies of causal beliefs associated with illness following the same traumatic event have focused on western countries and none have considered the role of karma. We interviewed 264 sri lankan tsunami survivors.

The strength of hostile criticism, an aspect of hooley and teasdale's (1989) concept of expressed emotion, negative attributions toward a partner (fincham & bradbury, 1993), and the multisystem assessment of stress and health (mash), a stress and coping theory developed by olson (1997), were compared in a clinically depressed sample of 139 women. Previous findings linking (a) the receipt of hostile criticism with increased symptoms of depression and (b) making negative attributions about a partner's negative behaviors and decreased couple satisfaction were replicated. After couple resources of communication, flexibility and closeness were entered into the equation, the impact of negative attributions on couple satisfaction was no longer significant. Similarly, once individual communication, individual closeness style, and couple problem solving skill were entered, hostile criticism from a partner had no additional impact on current depression. Therefore, these two variables, while theoretically interesting, account for very little variability in couple and individual adaptation levels. Individual stress predicted variance in both couple satisfaction and current depression symptoms, beyond that accounted for by individual and couple resources. Likewise, couple stress added unique variance to couple satisfaction level. In support of the mash model, robust relationships were found among couple stress, couple relationship resources, and couple satisfaction. The mash model proposes stressors and resources at one level of system (i.e., individual, couple, family and work) can influence level of adaptation at another system level. This was supported insofar as individual stress reduced couple satisfaction, individual communication predicted its increase, and couple problem solving skill offset current depression symptoms. The mash model's proposal that resources will interact with stressors to moderate adaptation level was partially supported. Four of nine individual and couple resources interacted with stressors to moderate their impact on adaptation. The role of moderating variables in this sample was unclear with two increasing and two decreasing the impact of stress on level of adaptation. The data support treating both clinical depression and relationship dysfunction when depression is presented as an outcome of couple conflict.

This paper describes the development of a measure designed to assess respondents' intellectual disability literacy. Following a pilot with 114 participants, the idls was revised and then completed by 1376 members of the public (aged 18-78 years) from diverse cultural backgrounds. The measure was able to distinguish respondents who showed good intellectual disability literacy. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed four causal beliefs factors (adversity, biomedical: fate, environment) that accounted for 55\% of the variance and three intervention beliefs factors (lifestyle, expert help, religion/spiritual,) that explained 52\% of the variance. Test-retest reliability for these factors was good for all ethnic groups. The four-item social distance scale had good internal consistency for all ethnic groups and acceptable concurrent validity. The idls is a useful new tool to evaluate knowledge, beliefs and social distance to intellectual disability in lay people, is suitable for cross-cultural research-and allows comparison of intellectual disability and mental health literacy in any given population.

Whereas eb purportedly serves to defend a vulnerable self-concept by avoiding negative self-attributions and might therefore exacerbate poor insight, pb may reflect cognitive deficits, including theory-of-mind impairment. We investigated these proposals in 34 schizophrenic patients with a history of pds and 21 healthy controls. Patients with moderate- to severe-pds and patients without a current pd showed excessive eb which was, surprisingly, absent in patients with mild persecutory delusions (mild-pds). That eb might wax and wane with fluctuating delusional intensity was interpreted in accord with a new dynamic model of attribution self-representation cycles [bentall et al., 2000. Pds: a review and theoretical integration. Clinical psychology review, 21, 1143-1192]. As predicted, eb exacerbated poor insight. However, counter to predictions, theory-of-mind impairment did not increase pb, which was marked in all participants, whether clinical or non-clinical; instead, theory-of-mind impairment was also correlated with poor insight. Our findings indicate multiple pathways to poor insight, one of which is a theory-of-mind difficulty, impairing the capacity to simulate other perspectives for the purpose of critically evaluating one's own beliefs and circumstances.

The construct of attributional style refers to the specific ways people explain events, both positive and negative. An optimistic attributional style (oas) for negative events has been shown to be reliably associated with low rates of depression (peterson et al., 1985; sweeney et al., 1986; hu et al., 2015). On the contrary, an optimistic attributional style for positive events is a separate phenomenon associated mainly with well-being, but these relationships remain underexplored. Objective. This study aimed to explore the predictive power of oas-positive, its relationships with subjective well-being, and possible personality mediators related to positive functioning. We hypothesized that the abilities to feel grateful and savor positive life events mediate the relationship between optimistic thinking about positive outcomes and subjective well-being. Design. A cross-sectional design was implemented. The participants were 271 adults from moscow and moscow region (m age = 32.42, sd=12.9). Results. The results of regression analysis showed that both life satisfaction and subjective happiness depended on gratitude, self-esteem, and dispositional optimism, but only happiness was predicted by savoring the moment. The results of structural equation modeling were consistent with the hypothesis since the structural model revealed that the effects of oas-positive on subjective well-being were fully mediated by gratitude and savoring the moment, as well as self-esteem and dispositional optimism. The mediated effects of oas-negative through self-esteem and gratitude were inconsistent, and its total indirect effect on subjective well-being was not significant. Conclusion. This research provides preliminary evidence that optimistic thinking about positive life events promotes subjective well-being through a system of positive psychological traits and attitudes which include gratitude and savoring the moment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,OPTIMISTIC ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE (OAS);SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING (SWB);;SAVORING THE MOMENT;GRATITUDE;LIFE SATISFACTION;HAPPINESS;DISPOSITIONAL OPTIMISM,,

The main question was whether individual- (e.g. Trait anxiety) and psycho-social factors (e.g. Own childhood, female sex-roles, support from the partner, desire for the baby) were predictive of interactive characteristics of early postnatal relationship. The present analyses using the method of path-analysis have searched for direct links and indirect paths through the attitude and anxiety towards pregnancy or experiences of childbearing. Data were collected longitudinally by questionnaires from a controlled sample of 78 first-time pregnant women, so the results cannot be generalised for the population. The 13 variables of the model were obtained by principal component-analysis of our own questionnaires and from scales of other standardised and publihed questionnaires (stai, pas, mabs). In some cases, data reduction was done to create groups of variables. The statistical model was constructed on the basis of the relationships between the variables of the two study periods, the 26-36 weeks of pregnancy and the first 2 weeks of very early postnatal relationship. Variables at the first level of the model were trait anxiety and psycho-social factors. The second level included anxiety and attitude towards the pregnancy, and at the third level there were the variables describing childbearing experiences and very early dyadic contact after the childbirth. The last, fourth level of the model included the factors of irritability and sociality of the baby, self-confidence of the caregiver, and satisfaction with the changed life-style after childbirth. Without detailing the paths it can be concluded that the parameters of the model (good fit-indexes, significant paths, the explained variance scores of the variables) support the modelled prediction that the early self-confidence of the caregiver can be predicted not only directly by the perceived irritability of the child (as other researches have already shown), but also indirectly by prenatal factors mediated by the attitude towards pregnancy. Thus, prenatal factors may have protective effects counterbalancing risks carried by negative child characteristics.

rayyan-984748802,Insight And Psychoeducational Interventions In Schizophrenia,2009,1,1,ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES,,,,,BILLIET C and ANTOINE P and LESAGE R and SANGARE ML,,,,,"Poor insight is consistently present in schizophrenia and is among the most discriminating symptoms for differentiating schizophrenia from other mental disorders. Patients are unable to see the most obvious symptoms of their illness, despite the fact that their family members can recognize thought disorder, mania or hallucinations. Results suggest that lack of insight is a part of the disorder itself, rather than an adaptive strategy. Poor insight in schizophrenia has been described as a lack of awareness of suffering from an illness, of the symptoms of the illness, of the consequences of the disorder, and of the need for treatment. Similarly to some negative symptoms lack of insight predisposes to an increased number of relapses and hospitalizations, to deteriorating social skills and quality of social relationships, and to a worsening course of illness. Unawareness is among the best predictions of non-adherence to treatment. Patients do not want to take medicine for an illness they do not think they have. The ways in which patients think about their illness experiences have been associated with a variety of behaviours and emotional responses. In schizophrenia, the study of beliefs about mental illness has generally been centered on people's interpretations of experiences and how these interpretations contribute to the development and maintenance of symptoms. There are less studies of other beliefs such as the causes of the experience, beliefs about treatment, consequences, and how long the illness is likely to last. The need to understand the way in which a patient appraises his/her own experiences has been recognized. People who integrated their experiences more fully, accepting that they had experienced a psychotic episode, actually showed higher levels of depression. This may reflect the demoralization and stigma that patients associate with mental illness. Many clinicians believe that lack of insight is very often a consequence of denial, a defensive mechanism. Terms such as defensive denial, and lack of insight often reflect underlying conceptual differences. Psychoeducational interventions were developed to increase patients' knowledge of, and awareness about their illness, there is a focus on knowledge. Education is a process by which a patient gains understanding through learning. Patients have a right to an accurate and complete knowledge regarding their illness and treatment. The assumption is that this increased knowledge and insight will enable patients to cope in a more effective way. Learning implies changes in behaviour, skill or attitude. There is some suggestion that psychoeducation may improve compliance with medication and have a positive effect on a patients' quality of life. Psychoeducational approaches involve interaction between the caregiver and the mentally ill person. Patient education can take a variety of forms and objectives. It may take place in groups or on a one-to-one basis and it may involve the use of videotapes, self-help or other media. The goal may be to better manage the patient's treatment, illness or condition to help him/her attain an improved level of health. Psychoeducational interventions address the illness from a multidimensional viewpoint, including familial, social and pharmacological information. Patients are provided with support, information and management strategies. Interventions may include elements of behavioural training, social and life skills training, or education performed by professional caregivers. This review studies the links between insight and various psychoeducationl interventions: health and treatment education, psychosocial skills training, familial intervention, and intervention focused on subjective illness experience.

The differential diagnosis of patients with medically unexplainable symptoms includes conversion disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and illness anxiety disorder among others. Conversion disorder is a mental disorder with pseudo-neurological symptoms that are not due to an organic abnormality. For its diagnosis it is necessary to show that the symptoms and findings are not compatible with neurological diseases. Conversion disorder and any neurological diseases can coexist, in which cases neurologists and psychiatrists should cooperate when treating the patient. However, it is difficult to clearly distinguish individual symptoms by their mechanism. Patients complaining of physical symptoms, including those with conversion disorder, require careful explanation that takes into account the patient's explanatory model. Clinicians must switch from an acute disease model to a chronic disease model. These patients are more likely to concentrate consciously on their physical condition and clinicians should help patients avoid ruminating on their physical symptoms. Because it is not simple to completely exclude physical disorders and prove that the symptoms are psychogenic, confirming a diagnosis should be performed carefully.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,PSYCHIATRY*;CONVERSION DISORDER/*DIAGNOSIS;NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASES/*DIAGNOSIS;CONVERSION DISORDER/COMPLICATIONS;DIAGNOSIS;DIFFERENTIAL;HUMANS;NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASES/COMPLICATIONS,,

Brugger et al. (See record [rid]2013-20861-001[/rid]). The paper by brugger, kurthen, rashidi-ranjbar and leggenhager describes how individuals who are 'potential medical specialists' compare to those who are not in perceiving causal attributions in a rare condition, xenomelia. This work is timely given that since the first description in 1977, authors witnessed a raise in studies in 2009 and in 2014, but the general trend is of 3.8 papers per year. Compared to other rare conditions, such as capgras syndrome or alien hand syndrome, the difference is striking. Between 1977 and 2018, 549 papers have been published on capgras and 176 on alien hand. Hence, this paper is fundamental to understand this different attitude towards xenomelia, and what can be done to get out of the quicksand in which authors have ended up. Bruggeret al. Paper should guide the development of future studies on xenomelia. We need to include biological, social and cultural components, but for the latter ones we need an operational definition of which components and why. This definition is still lacking, while neuroscientific studies benefit from a clear direction towards exploring more known body representation components. Secondly, we need to know more about the individuals with xenomelia perspective on this causality relationship, as 'patients' are the main actors in clinical settings and without their compliance any effort towards providing support or a treatment is ineffective.

Maltreated children are at increased risk for internalizing problems including anxiety and depression. In fact, estimates of the prevalence of clinical depression in samples of maltreated children have been placed as high as 18%, compared with a base rate of 2-3% in the child population as a whole (kaufman, 1991). Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that these difficulties may well persist into adulthood with recent studies showing that adults who were maltreated as children are three times more likely to become depressed than adults who were not maltreated as children (brown, cohen, johnson, & smailes, 1999). However, despite such dramatic findings, there are few studies that attempt to explain the mechanisms underlying this link between child maltreatment and depressive symptomatology. The present study represents one of few studies in which attributional style is tested as one such mechanism. Specifically, it was hypothesized that attributional style would be significantly related to both maltreatment severity and self-reported depressive symptomatology. In addition, it was hypothesized that attributional style would mediate the relation between maltreatment severity and self-reported depressive symptomatology in younger children while attributional style would moderate the relation between maltreatment severity and self-reported depressive symptomatology in older children. Results indicated that attributional style was significantly related to self-reported depressive symptomatology in both age groups. In contrast, the relationship between maltreatment severity and self-reported depressive symptomatology was significant only among the younger children. Attributional style was not found to mediate or moderate the relation between maltreatment severity and self-reported depressive symptoms. The results of post-hoc analyses revealed that maltreatment severity was linked to the stability-instability dimension of attributional style in older children. Findings were generally consistent across various operationalizations of attributional style.

Two hypotheses guided this investigation. First, the tendency to derive self-referent attributions was hypothesized to influence the association between relational victimization and self-reports of internalizing symptoms, including symptoms of depression, loneliness and anxiety. Gender was anticipated to moderate the results between relational victimization and internalizing symptoms in that the model was predicted to be supported for females but not males. Ethnicity was not hypothesized to moderate the results. Participants were 273 fifth and sixth grade (111 male subjects, 162 female subjects) (127 european-american, 146 latino/a) public elementary and middle school students from two rural communities in nebraska. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships among the proposed variables. Findings do not support the hypothesis that the tendency to derive self-referent attributions mediates the linkage between relational victimization and internalizing symptoms. However, the model did suggest that relational victimization accounted for approximately 58.1% of the variance in youth's internalizing symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Furthermore, neither gender nor ethnic differences were found between the proposed mediation models. The discussion focuses on implications of the study's findings, factors that may have impacted the results, and future research directions on peer relationships among youth.

When the characteristics formed a plausible causal chain, adding a causal explanation increased perceived normality; but when a causal chain was implausible, perceived normality decreased. In experiments 2 and 3, a negative life event (e.g., is very stressed out due to her workload) was added as an explanation for the first characteristic in a three-characteristic causal chain.

The present study establishes an association between occupations and diagnoses of alcohol dependence disorder and alcohol abuse disorder, using data from a large population-based household interview study. Statistical adjustment using logistic methods reveals that apparent associations between occupations and alcohol-related disorders previously reported in the literature are due to characteristics of those employed in various occupations. The prevalence of alcohol dependence and abuse in two high risk industries, construction and transportation, is confirmed. More than one in four construction laborers and one in five skilled construction trades workers received a dis/dsm-iii diagnosis related to alcohol abuse. In the transportation industry one in six heavy truck drivers and material movers received an alcohol diagnosis. Analyses of the data from individuals currently employed and not employed in their occupation reveals reduction in risk for those who leave some occupations and increased risk for those who leave other occupations. Evidence is presented that employment in some occupations may be protective for alcohol dependence. The findings support the view that occupation may be associated with alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse independent of demographic variations. Previously proposed explanatory models for associations between occupations and alcohol problems are called into question because they do not take into account the demographic characteristics and employment status of workers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ALCOHOLISM/*EPIDEMIOLOGY;OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES/*EPIDEMIOLOGY;OCCUPATIONS/*STATISTICS & NUMERICAL DATA;ADULT;ALCOHOLISM/REHABILITATION;CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES;FEMALE;HUMANS;INCIDENCE;MALE;MIDDLE AGED;OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES/REHABILITATION;RISK FACTORS;UNITED STATES/EPIDEMIOLOGY;Occupations,,

Cannabis is known to exacerbate positive symptoms, compound the effects of negative symptoms, and lead to relapse, having a negative effect upon quality of life. If this is so, why would people choose to continue the drug use? Most previous studies exploring this phenomenon have used quantitative methodology where the questions asked have been preset by the researchers and the subjective experience of the patient has been minimized. Qualitative methodology was utilized in this study in order to give voice to the patients' perspectives, and contribute to the knowledge of the frameworks of meanings employed by patients. The majority of participants in this study did not perceive that they had a mental illness and they held strong beliefs regarding the usefulness of cannabis. They gave explanations for their continuing cannabis use that expanded the understanding from previous studies. These included that they sought the drug effects of cannabis use for clarity of voices, control of symptoms, to feel normal, perceived improvement in cognitive function, reduced psychological pain and increased energy. These beliefs may influence a person's adherence with treatment and their future cannabis use. This research has implications for clinical practice as clinicians may lack insight into the importance of the phenomenological beliefs of a person with schizophrenia. This lack of insight by the clinician into the phenomenological beliefs may impact on the development of a therapeutic relationship.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,CANNABIS;EXPLANATORY MODELS;MEDICAL MODEL;PATIENT PERSPECTIVES;;SCHIZOPHRENIA;Schizophrenia;Cannabis,,

As a purposive outgrowth of modularity, self-deception may serve to isolate threatening thoughts from consciousness and facilitate cooperation. The primary goal of the present investigation was to determine if individuals with depression exhibit both low levels of self-deception and cooperation. Relationships between the tendency to self-deceive and the conscious attributions typical of depression or promoting cooperation were also examined. Eighty undergraduate participants completed measures of self-deception, impression management, depression, and attributional styles. Cooperation was assessed by responses to social dilemmas based on the prisoner's dilemma game. Results indicated that, as expected, high self-deceivers cooperated more and exhibited lower levels of depression than low self-deceivers. Self-deception scores were significantly associated with several attributional styles but independently predicted depressive symptomology. That individuals with depression displayed both reduced levels of self-deception and cooperation is discussed in light of several models of the evolutionary significance of depression, especially e.

rayyan-984748818,Does Trauma Type Influence Views Of Ptsd? An Investigation Of Mental Health Literacy In Military Veterans,2021,1,1,NA,,,,,SIMS BM,,,,,"Background: a possible limitation in conceptualizing posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) among service members and veterans (sm/vs) entails the imbalanced attention towards life threatening traumas versus non-life threatening traumas. As such, traumatized sm/vs may not recognize core features of probable ptsd when the index trauma is non-life threatening, leading to unhelpful beliefs about their symptoms that may limit the probability of mental health care utilization. This study applied the concept of mental health literacy (mhl) and the theory of planned behavior to understand how functional literacy and other personal factors such as demographics, psychopathology, and stigma affects sm/vs' ability to correctly identify probable ptsd across life threatening and non-life threatening trauma types. Method: a sample of 302 of non-treatment seeking sm/vs participated in this online study, recruited from student veterans of america and amazon's mechanical turk. Participants were randomly assigned one of four vignettes that depicted a fictitious character struggling with diagnostically-congruent posttraumatic stress symptoms following a military-related traumatic event (life threat—self, traumatic loss, moral injury – self, or moral injury – other). Next, the sm/vs completed the mental health literacy questionnaire and help-seeking intentions, along with mental health screeners (patient health questionnaire 8, posttraumatic stress disorder check list 5, and the expressions of moral injury scale –military) and stigma measures (endorsed and anticipated stigma inventories). Results: approximately 25.3% of the sample endorsed clinical levels of ptsd symptomatology and 28.7% of the sample endorsed clinical levels of depressive symptomatology. In total, 93.6% of the sm/vs correctly identified ptsd across the vignettes. Sm/vs identified that stress was the primary problem in the vignettes that depicted a life threatening trauma (56.4%) or traumatic loss (42.5%), whereas moral/ethical factors were the primary cause of morally injurious events by the self (48.7%) and by others (54.7%). Across the groups, 94.7% to 98.7% believed that the character should seek help for probable ptsd and the largest selected source for help was from a mental health professional. Of the factors assessed in the study, results of multivariate binary logistic regressions analyses did not reveal statistically significant factors associated with the ability to correctly identify probable ptsd. Conclusion: the findings from this mhl study revealed that sm/vs have sufficient recognition of ptsd in a manner that was not statistically related with trauma type. Sm/vs endorsed an overall positive outlook on mental illness and mental health treatment and were likely to use mental health resources if they were struggling with posttraumatic stress. These results are encouraging and perhaps demonstrate the effort of many organizations' efforts to disseminate helpful information on ptsd and the possible helpfulness of mental health service.

Conceptualizing interactions between voice hearers and their voices as a `relationship' has recently become an area of psychological inquiry. To date the literature exploring the details of a hearer-voice relationship has arguably privileged the researchers' account of voice hearing at the expense of the individual's explanatory framework and perspective. The present study aimed to establish the perspectives of voice hearers regarding any `relationship' they may have developed with their voices. Method. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 service users who had heard voices for at least 12 months. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis ( ipa). Results. Analysis resulted in five major themes, three of which are discussed here: defining the `other' which detailed the personification process; `me vs. The voice' which explored oppositional positioning between participants and their voice and strategies employed to retain power and `the voice and me' which considered the union that was apparent, as well as participants' rejection of a relational concept. The concept of a `relationship' was both accepted and rejected by participants. Acceptance of relating was relative to the poverty of social relationships. Rejections were considered in terms of preservation of self-hood, conflict with personal explanatory models and constructions of the term `relationship'. Conclusions. This study has provided evidence that supports new developments in working relationally with voices. Working within this frame may help to emphasize hearers' strengths whilst ameliorating distress. However, this concept needs to be posed as a possible rather than an established conceptualization.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

The participants consisted of postpartum women with psychotic illness, caregivers/family members, psychiatric nurses and psychologists. A modified version of a family psychoeducation programme for postpartum women with psychosis was formulated and pilot-tested. Results: modifications in the standard family psychoeducation programme were both in the process and content of family psychoeducation. Under process, effective communication, cultural background, appropriate dress, involving only one family member, low literacy, and flexibility in timekeeping were raised. The theme of content yielded the incorporation of lay perceptions of mental illness, family planning, income generating, and an emphasis of premorbid and morbid personalities of the patients. Conclusion: the basic principles and assumptions underlying psychoeducation remained the same.

First, we show that there is a cultural model of addiction causality that is both shared and contested. Second, we examine how individuals’ understanding of that model is associated with stigma attribution. Research was conducted among undergraduate students at the university of alabama. College students in the 18–25 age range are especially at risk for developing substance use disorder, and they are, perhaps more than any other population group, intensely targeted by drug education. The elicited cultural model includes different types of causes distributed across five distinct themes: biological, self-medication, familial, social, and hedonistic. Though there was cultural consensus among respondents overall, residual agreement analysis showed that the cultural model of addiction causality is a multicentric domain. Two centers of the model, the moral and the medical, were discovered. Differing adherence to these centers is associated with the level of stigma attributed towards individuals with substance use disorder. The results suggest that current approaches to substance use education could contribute to stigma attribution, which may or may not be inadvertent. The significance of these results for both theory and the treatment of addiction are discussed.

The current study examined an alternative conceptualization of ocd as a disorder of emotion-based impulsivity, with a harm avoidant presentation expected to predominate in individuals with high sensitivity to punishment, and an njr/i presentation expected to predominate in individuals with high sensitivity to reinforcement. Adult study participants (n = 119) were obtained via mturk. Study measures included the obsessive-compulsive core dimensions questionnaire – trait version (summerfeldt, kloosterman, antony, & swinson, 2014); the three factor impulsivity index (carver, johnson, joormann, kim, & nam, 2011) – specifically the two factors related to emotion-triggered impulsivity; and a shortened version of the behavioral inhibition system/behavioral activation system (carver & white, 1994). First, harm avoidance was expected to be positively correlated with reflexive inaction, and njr/i sensations were expected to be positively correlated with reflexive action; the first hypothesis was fully supported. Second, harm avoidance was expected to be positively correlated with sensitivity to punishment, and njr/i sensations were expected to be positively correlated with sensitivity to reinforcement; the second hypothesis was not supported. Third, reflexive inaction and sensitivity to punishment were expected to positively predict harm avoidance, while reflexive action and sensitivity to reinforcement were expected to positively predict njr/i sensations. The model for harm avoidance was significant, with 56.0% of variance in scores explained. The model for njr/i sensations was significant, with 64.8% of variance in scores explained by reflexive action; sensitivity to reinforcement did not contribute. Fourth, specific tendencies toward a) reflexive action during intense negative mood and b) reward responsiveness were expected to predict njr/i sensations. The model was significant, with 48.1% of variance in scores explained by reflexive action during intense negative mood; reward responsiveness did not contribute. Taken together, findings supported the conceptualization of ocd as a disorder of emotion-based impulsivity (with reflexive action consistently predicting njr/i, and reflexive inaction predicting harm avoidance). However, findings did not support the hypothesized role of incentive sensitivity.

While liberal' on civil rights, it often expressed ambivalence or alarm. The background of these responses included the re-education' of west germans, in which american occupation officials tried to discredit nazi racism, but also offered a view of us history in which the post-civil war reconstruction of the south had allowed black men sexual access to white women. Some press writers represented reconstruction as the origin of white resistance to equality, and often showed more sympathy for the resisters than was consistent with their stated support for black rights. Using the language of racial mixture, they evoked the fear felt by many southern whites and also alluded to contemporary west german anxiety about mixed-race children of german women and black-american gis. About 1964, in an increasingly liberal environment, the press dropped this theme, but offered alarming accounts of black militancy. Around that time, coming to terms with the past' suggested comparisons of american with nazi racism. The mainstream german press of the early 1960s was dividing into liberal' and conservative' branches, but both supported civil rights. These were also the years when a young generation of journalists rose to positions on editorial staffs, but older journalists were also supportive of the black cause. The conclusion draws attention to the lack of empathy with blacks in a discourse favouring black rights, and recommends a more concrete explanatory model than those found in a historiography favouring abstraction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Our aim was to investigate associations between illness perceptions, anxiety sensitivity, somatic amplification, and experience of chest pain, and to assess whether a multifactorial model including these factors can distinguish patients with nccp from patients with cardiac chest pain (ccp).; Methods: a total of 240 patients with chest pain answered questionnaires concerning anxiety sensitivity (anxiety sensitivity index-3), somatic amplification (somatosensory amplification scale), illness perceptions (illness perception questionnaire-brief, health concerns, and heart disease conviction), and pain characteristics (intensity, disability, and frequency) before the evaluation of chest pain causation. They were classified as having nccp or ccp by cardiac angiography. Partial correlation analyses and binary logistic regression analyses were performed.; Results: seventy percent of patients with chest pain were classified as having nccp.

The problem statement and rationale for this investigation are discussed. Generally speaking, the rationale was that current treatment modalities for adhd are impoverished to some degree due to no empirically established procedure for training the transfer of cognitive treatment effects. In this study, at was proposed to serve as the cognitive-behavioral procedure for training cognitive generalization, which in turn would not only empower adhd children's cognitive abilities, but hopefully alter his/her cognitive repertoire to be more conducive to the acquisition and maintenance of advanced cognitive skills.

Research on mental health is very crucial and different from other kinds of health-related researches. Thus, while conducting mental health research, it is important that the researchers be careful in choosing and applying appropriate methodology. It is a very critical field of research, requiring interdisciplinary research methodological approaches. An eclectic strategy is required to give an innate understanding of the phenomenon of mental health. Studies should follow both anthropological and epidemiological notions to understand human behaviour, for better management and planning of the mental health services. The proposed paper discusses `cultural epidemiology' as a methodology and explores its contribution to the contemporary mental health research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,"CULTURAL EPIDEMIOLOGY (CE);MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY;MENTAL HEALTH;;EPIDEMIOLOGY;India;Anthropology, Medical",,

However, to our knowledge there is no published data to date that provides an explanatory model for these findings. Twenty-eight individuals with mild ad received in-depth interviews and measures of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and spiritual functioning to gain insight into this question in this mixed methods study. Findings revealed that people with mild ad can actively engage in meaningful discussion about how spirituality influences their experience of living with ad; that they remain deeply devoted to a relationship with the transcendent (i.e., god, higher power, spirit) and their spiritual communities; that they value and benefit from the sacred aspects of their day-to-day lives; and that their core spiritual values, beliefs, and practices can be activated to help them adapt to the uncertainty of living with ad. Additionally, persons with ad who are experiencing spiritual struggle tend to experience a greater degree of anxiety, depression, and behavioral changes as compared to those who do not, suggesting that spiritual struggle is a risk factor for poorer outcomes in this population. Implications for future research, clinical practice, and community care are provided including how researchers and clinicians can effectively adapt traditional measures of spirituality for use with this population; the importance of integrating spirituality into the assessment and treatment of people with ad; and the role spiritual communities can play in helping or hindering people with ad as they adapt to this disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,RELIGION;SPIRITUALITY;COPING;ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE;Alzheimer Disease,,

They influence beliefs about the causes of mental illness and also impact willingness to seek treatment. In the united states, little is known about the psychological adjustment of south asians, particularly indian immigrants and first generation indian american christians. In this study, i investigated the effect of acculturation, ethnic identity, and religious commitment on stigma, etiological beliefs about common childhood and adolescent psychological disorders (attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (adhd), depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and autism), and help-seeking attitudes in the indian orthodox population. Forty-six indian immigrants and 64 first generation indian americans completed electronic or paper questionnaires assessing their level of acculturation, ethnic identity, and religious commitment. Participants also completed measures on stigma, help-seeking attitudes, and causal beliefs (biological, psychosocial, and spiritual). The results showed that religious commitment was negatively associated with stigma and positively associated with help-seeking attitudes. Participants who rated high on acculturation endorsed biological underpinning for adhd, autism, depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse. Previous knowledge of mental illness was linked to fewer ratings of spiritual causes for adhd, autism and depression, but religious commitment was associated with increased ratings of spiritual causes for alcohol abuse.

Sixty-one oncology healthcare professionals from two university-affiliated cancer centers in israel were interviewed.; Results: the findings resulted in three main categories that included perceptions of suicidality, explanatory models of suicidality, and moral views on suicide. Healthcare professionals considered suicidality in their patients to be a cry for help, a sign of distress, or an attempt at attention seeking. Participants explained suicidality as stemming from a biological disease, from mental illness, as an aberration, or as an impulsive, irrational act. Moral views on suicidality were split among those who were mostly accepting of these patients' actions versus those who rejected it outright. A third group of healthcare professionals expressed ambivalence about suicidality in their patients.; Conclusions: healthcare professionals vary greatly in their perceptions on suicide.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of experimentally induced learned helplessness on transient affect and self-efficacy for functional ability in children and adolescents with juvenile rheumatic diseases (jrd). Participants were 50 children and adolescents receiving medical treatment in an outpatient pediatric rheumatology clinic at the children's hospital of oklahoma who were diagnosed with one of four jrd (i.e., juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile dermatomyositis, or a spondylarthropathy); each child had been symptomatic for at least 6 months. Disease-related information including objective illness severity was obtained by the pediatric rheumatologist. After a regularly scheduled appointment, each participant completed a background information questionnaire and the children's depression inventory. In addition, participants completed the functional ability self-efficacy scale for children, the positive and negative affect schedule, and a measure of internal/external attributions related to the experimental task prior to and immediately following a computerized learned helplessness induction procedure. Findings and conclusions. Results indicated that children exposed to noncontingent feedback demonstrated decreased positive affect over time whereas there was no change for those exposed to contingent feedback. In addition, those in the contingent condition demonstrated increased internal attributions across time whereas there was no change for those in the noncontingent condition. Finally, children in the contingent condition demonstrated increased control self-efficacy for functional ability over time whereas there was no change for those in the noncontingent condition. These findings suggest that children with jrd who experience environmental noncontingency are at risk for developing deficits in mood, whereas behavior-outcome contingency may produce increased perceptions of control over functional ability and enhance cognitive appraisal mechanisms (i.e., causal attributions) associated with favorable disease outcome.

Mediterranean diet, physical activity increase and smoking withdrawal counseling were provided.; Results: af patients have higher psm associated with gender (women), older age, anxiety and depression. Higher gse, greater adherence to mediterranean diet profile and coffee habits (greater coffee users) are associated with a reduced hazard of perceived stress. By multiple linear regression, psm is explained by anxiety and ipqr (statistically significant are emotional representation and illness coherence subscales), which account for 92.2% of the variance (p<0.0001).; Conclusion: our results outline that psychological stress is greater in women in comparison with men. Illness perceptions are important in the context of perceived stress in af. This effect appears to be modulated by greater self-efficacy and by adherence to mediterranean diet profile, that when higher, are associated with a reduced hazard of perceived stress.

This study explores (a) what kind of negative perceptions are feared, and (b) whether these listener perception beliefs depend on how the person speaks. One hundred and six people who stuttered reported listener perception beliefs to five ways of speaking: (1) normal fluency, (2) stuttered speech (repetitions, prolongations, blocks), (3) prolonged speech learned in fluency shaping therapy, (4) hesitant speech (verbal avoidance behaviors like interjections and revisions) and (5) a mix of stuttered speech and hesitant speech. Each participant watched five video clips, each containing one way of speaking. Participants made quantitative judgments on each clip regarding listener perception beliefs of pleasantness, self-confidence, communicative competence, intelligence, social rejection and causal attribution. It was found that people who stuttered expected fluent speech to be perceived most positively and hesitant speech most negatively. People who had undergone fluency shaping treatment in the past expected prolonged speech to be perceived more positively than stuttered speech, whereas people who had not undergone fluency shaping therapy expected no difference. In the discussion section, speech-language clinicians are encouraged to integrate the analysis of listener perception beliefs and their implications for social anxiety into stuttering treatment.

The first two groups did not differ in attributions, but the attributions of both groups differed from those of the control group.

Results of multiple regression analysis show that severity of depression was related to irrational beliefs, attributions, the interaction of attributions and life events, and the interaction of attributions and session. There was no relationship between depression and the interaction of irrational beliefs and life events. The attributions × session interaction indicated that the relationship between attributions and depression changed over the period studied; the relationship between irrational beliefs and depression was stable over time.

Methods: seventeen elite gymnasts, 51 non-elite gymnasts and a control group of 85 schoolgirls, participating in non-elite, merely recreational non-aesthetic sports, completed self-report measures of dieting behaviors and body image. Results: after controlling for bmi, the results showed that elite gymnasts dieted more often than controls, although they were not more negative about their body. Furthermore, non-elite gymnasts dieted as much as controls and had a more positive body image. Despite what general theories predict, the gymnasts' dieting was not so much related to a negative body image but rather to weight-related causal attributions or perceived weight-related coach pressure. Conclusions: whereas controls believe that `thin is beautiful', gymnasts seem more convinced or persuaded that `thin is going to win'.

Methods and procedures: in a representative population-based survey (n = 1,000), computer-assisted telephone interviewing was used to assess stigmatizing attitudes toward obesity, causal attributions of obesity, the labeling of obesity as an illness, perceptions about prevalence, severity, and chronicity of obesity, support of obesity prevention, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: of the 1,000 participants, 23.5% (n = 235) had stigmatizing attitudes toward obesity, 21.5% (n = 215) did not have stigmatizing attitudes toward obesity, and 55.0% (n = 550) had attitudes that were undetermined with respect to stigmatization. Predictors of greater stigmatization were more causal attributions of obesity to individual behavior, less education, and older age, while causal attributions of obesity to heredity and labeling obesity as an illness predicted less stigmatization. Stigmatizing attitudes were significantly associated with stronger overall support of obesity prevention, but less readiness to support prevention financially. Discussion: our results indicate that stigmatizing attitudes toward obesity are prevalent in the population. Information about the etiology of obesity and the clinical relevance of this condition could prove useful for destigmatization efforts.

Common perinatal mental disorders (cpmds) are frequently experienced in low and middle-income countries (lmic), where low-educational attainment, poverty, and gender-based violence are widely recognized risk factors. The goal of this dissertation research was to examine local understandings of perinatal mental health to inform the development of a mental health intervention that will be integrated into community-based maternal health services in selingue, mali. To achieve this goal, we had three research aims: first, to qualitatively identify local terms and ethnomedical models for mental health among perinatal women in mali, west africa; second, to develop a holistic understanding of local syndrome(s) for mental health among perinatal women; and third, to identify a feasible and acceptable intervention model for the integration of mental health into community-based maternal services for perinatal women in selingue, mali. Methods. First, we conducted freelist interviews among perinatal women, auxiliary midwives, and community health workers (chws), to identify local terms for mental health. In-depth interviews were carried out among perinatal women, auxiliary midwives, chws, and mental health specialists to gain a nuanced understanding of priority mental health problems, perceived causes, and if and how women seek care or manage their distress. To gain a holistic understanding of local syndrome(s) for perinatal mental health, we conducted pile sorts, asking participants to sort 36 terms, identified from the free lists, into groups based on which terms go together. We then performed exploratory factor analysis (efa) on a perinatal depression scale, adapted for the malian context. Lastly, we performed a scoping literature review on current best practices for closing the maternal mental health treatment gap and used data from in-depth interviews to develop recommendations for a locally informed approach for integrated mental and maternal health care. Results. Perinatal women used idioms of distress to communicate difficulties (geleya), pain, stress, and suffering (tooro), worries (hamin), and a crying heart or sadness (dusukasi). Participants indicated that these idioms of distress operate along a progressive continuum of severity of distress that increases with time, both between and within idioms. Using multidimensional scaling to analyze the pile sorts data, we identified a single large cluster, indicating that there is one single category of included terms for perinatal mental distress. The efa results were in agreement with the pile sorts findings, yielding one single underlying construct for perinatal mental distress. Results from the scoping literature review indicate that integrated mental health intervention models that rely on task-sharing, are successful and strong approaches to address barriers towards closing the mental health treatment gap. Our qualitative findings suggest that it is both locally feasible and acceptable to integrate mental health services into existing community health care systems. Conclusions. Qualitative and quantitative examination of perinatal mental health in selingue, mali, contributed to both the holistic understanding and measurement of perinatal depression. In the context of poverty and lack of care and treatment options for mental illness, interventions that integrate mental health into community-based maternal health services emerge as locally acceptable and feasible strategies to narrow the mental health treatment gap in selingue, mali.

The author has offered two broad ways of thinking about explanations of delusions--the empirical and the rational. He offers some criticism of the former and an endorsement of the latter. He uses examples from clinical psychopathology to illustrate his argument and discusses the eponymously named delusions of capgras and coward--the former a subtype of delusional misidentification and the latter a delusion whose content is colored predominantly with nihilistic and possibly hypochondriacal themes. He discusses the empirical data in relation to such delusions and as an aid to discussing the empirical model more generally. It does seem a little unfortunate that these delusions, which are less than typical, become the focus of his paper. He has offered philosophers, psychiatrists, and psychologists not so much a description of the model of delusion formation that we endorse and test, but rather an ideal type of the purely empirical conception, which can then be contrasted with the rational approach. This is what makes it so important; it forces us to examine our models and become aware of where our theories lead us and how much our explanatory models require in the form of altered rationality, whether local or global.

There is evidence that patients with schizophrenia benefit from standard cognitive behaviour therapy (cbt) only if active techniques are used ('full therapy'). By contrast, attending sessions but not proceeding beyond engagement and assessment strategies ('partial therapy'), or simply not attending sessions ('no therapy'), is not associated with better outcomes. The factors leading to full therapy are unknown. We hypothesized that patients' initial ideas about the nature and extent of their problems would predict use of cbt. A match between patients' views of their problems and the principles underlying treatment would lead to better outcomes. Method. Ninety-two patients with a recent relapse of psychosis completed the illness perception questionnaire (ipq) before receiving cbt. We examined whether their illness perceptions predicted the take-up of therapy. Results. Patients who did not attend sessions believed their problems would not last as long as those who attended them. Those who attended sessions but did not proceed to full therapy had a lower sense of control over their problems and a more biological view of their causes. Patients who took up full therapy were more likely to attribute the cause of their problems to their personality and state of mind. The take-up of therapy was predicted neither by levels of psychiatric symptoms nor by insight. Conclusions. People with psychosis who have psychologically orientated views of their problems, including the potential to gain control over them, may be more likely to engage fully and do well with standard cbt for psychosis, irrespective of the severity of their problems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,CBT;ILLNESS REPRESENTATIONS;INSIGHT;OUTCOME;PSYCHOSIS;SCHIZOPHRENIA;Psychotic Disorders;Cognition,,

However, the factors that influence stigma toward people with a drug addiction have not yet been thoroughly investigated, compared with the stigma of other mental illnesses. Based on attribution theory, our experiment examined to what extent individual and contextual characteristics of people with a drug addiction influence stigmatizing attitudes toward people with a drug addiction. Moreover, we explored whether respondent characteristics indicative of familiarity with addiction decrease stigma toward people with a drug addiction. Method: we conducted a full factorial survey of 2,857 respondents from a german online access panel who were from all walks of life. We experimentally varied vignettes (2(9)-design) that featured a fictional person with an addiction. Stigmatizing beliefs, such as blame or fear, were assessed using the attribution questionnaire (aq-9). Results: different attributes of people with a drug addiction and of the characteristics of their addiction modulated stigma in ways that are mostly consistent with attribution theory and related research. For example, female gender and younger age of people with a drug addiction diminished several stigmatizing attitudes; greater duration of addiction and social influence to use drugs increased them. Furthermore, characteristics of respondents modulated stigma: women, younger respondents, and those with higher education expressed less stigmatizing responses than others. Conclusions: the stigmatization of people with a drug addiction is influenced by several factors, including characteristics of the stigmatized person, the addiction, and the person holding stigmatizing attitudes. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these effects is needed to develop evidence-based anti stigma measures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Substance-Related Disorders,,

Oxytocin (ot) has been shown to promote prosocial behavior; however, it remains unclear whether ot affects responsibility attribution and hypothetical resource allocation. In the present study, participants were intranasally administered ot or placebo (plc) before a response task with a partner. The participant could win a certain amount of money depending on the group’s performance, which was determined by the faster player. The contribution was manipulated to be similar in the first phase, while the participants could individually contribute more in the second phase. Our results show that both groups attributed more credit to the player who performed better in a trial. Moreover, reward magnitude only enhanced effort-based attribution in the ot group. Although both groups proposed to distribute money based on individual efforts, the plc group increased their effort-based allocation when they contributed more, regardless of the fact that the money was eventually equally distributed. Our study demonstrates that ot modulates responsibility attribution and hypothetical resource allocation in different manners, suggesting that ot has different effects on a participant’s perception of individual contribution and fairness when allocating a reward during social cooperation in a real effort task.

Non-adherence to immunosuppressants is a major cause of renal transplant failure. Interventions to improve adherence need to target modifiable risk factors. Methods. Adherence was measured using the `gold standard' measure of electronic monitoring in 58 adult renal transplant recipients from a uk transplant unit. Subjects were identified from a stratified random sample of 153 recipients recruited to a larger cross-sectional study comparing different measures of adherence. Inclusion criteria included age over 18 years and a functioning renal transplant, transplanted 6-63 months previously. Exclusion criteria included residence outside the region served by the unit and inability to give informed consent. Health beliefs, depression and functional status were measured using standardized questionnaires (beliefs about medicines questionnaire, illness perception questionnaire, revised clinical interview schedule and sf-36) and semi-structured interview. Transplant and demographic details were collected from the notes. Results. Seven [12\%, 95\% confidence interval (ci) 4-20\%] subjects missed at least 20\% of days medication and 15 (26\%, 15-37\%) missed at least 10\% of days. Lower belief in the need for medication and having a transplant from a live donor were the major factors associated with non-adherence. Depression was common, although not strongly associated with non-adherence. Conclusions. Beliefs about medication are a promising target for interventions designed to improve adherence. The lower adherence in recipients of transplants from live donors needs confirming but may be clinically important in light of the drive to increase live donation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,HEALTH BELIEFS;NON-ADHERENCE;RENAL TRANSPLANT;Risk Factors;Cross-Sectional Studies;Kidney Transplantation;Cesarean Section,,

Methodan online survey was completed by 1781 new zealand adults who had taken ads in the previous 5years. Resultsall 18 psychosocial variables measured were associated with depression reduction, and 16 with improved quality of life (qol). Logistic regression models revealed that the quality of the relationship with the prescriber was related to both depression reduction and improved qol. In addition, depression reduction was related to younger age, higher income, being fully informed about ads by the prescriber, fewer social causal beliefs for depression and not having lost a loved one in the 2months prior to prescription. Furthermore, both outcome measures were positively related to belief in chemical' rather than placebo' effects. Conclusionthere are multiple non-pharmacological processes involved in recovery while taking ads. Enhancing them, for example focusing on the prescriber-patient relationship and giving more information, may enhance recovery rates, with or without ads.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,DEPRESSION;ANTIDEPRESSANTS;THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP;CAUSAL BELIEFS;;NON-SPECIFIC EFFECTS;Antidepressive Agents,,

We reanalyzed data from a previously published randomized component study that aimed to test the incremental effect of systematic exposure in an internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment (icbt) for irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). Methods. Three hundred and nine individuals with ibs were randomly assigned to either the full treatment protocol (experimental condition) or the same treatment protocol without systematic exposure (control). Participants were assessed weekly for ibs symptoms over the active treatment phase. We used a complier average causal effect (cace) analysis, in the growth mixture modeling framework, to (1) examine the specific effect of exposure among those who received the intervention (i.e. Compliers), and (2) explore the associations of pre-treatment patient characteristics with compliance status and outcome changes. Results. Fifty-five per cent of those assigned to the experimental condition were classified as compliers. The cace analysis that took into account compliance status demonstrated that the magnitude of the incremental effect of systematic exposure on ibs symptoms was larger than the effect observed in an intention-to-treat analysis that ignored compliance status (d = 0.81 v. D = 0.44). Patients with university education showed more improvement during the exposure phase of the treatment. Pre-treatment patient characteristics did not predict compliance status. Conclusions. The effect of systematic exposure on ibs symptoms is of substantial magnitude among those individuals who actually receive the intervention (cace). Studying the subsample of individuals who discontinue treatment prematurely and tailoring interventions to improve compliance may increase overall improvement rates in icbt for ibs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ADHERENCE;DISMANTLING;GROWTH MIXTURE MODELING;IIRRITABLE BOWEL;SYNDROME;PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT;Causality,,

Sharing information about the general prevalence of fss, existing knowledge about risk factors, as well as guidance about adaptive coping strategies can be helpful in 'normalizing' the problem and 'empowering' families in management. Based on a clinical approach and supported by the revised classification systems, severe fss in children and adolescents can be grouped into three main categories of conditions dominated by: persistent somatic symptoms, dissociative or pseudoneurological symptoms, and illness worries or health anxiety. A psychiatric assessment is important in patients with severe fss for differential diagnosis to confirm or exclude the presence of a somatic symptom or a related disorder and the potential presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders amenable to psychiatric intervention. The development and maintenance of severe fss in children and young people are best understood within a generic biopsychosocial explanatory model. The consequence of the lacking implementation of systematic models for shared care in many places is that most young patients with severe fss are offered no or limited specialized assessment and treatment.

rayyan-984748872,A Qualitative Survey Of The Origins Of Multi-Dimensional Perfectionism And The Experiences Of Perfectionists And Non-Perfectionists,2019,1,1,NA,,,,,BALLOU-BROADNAX T,,,,,"Perfectionism is a complex construct with numerous implications for understanding and treating the emotional distress seen in many college students. Existing literature provides fairly consistent descriptions of the characteristics of individuals with perfectionism; however, it lacks causal explanations for questions such as: (a) why some individuals develop perfectionism but not others, (b) why perfectionism manifests in a multi-dimensional nature, or (c) why the emotional and behavioral correlates of perfectionism co-occur and correlate with the dimensions of perfectionism as they do. This exploratory study investigated these questions in order to generate hypotheses for future empirical studies designed to further understand the construct. Participants were 58 undergraduate and graduate students, 46 women and 12 men, with a mean age of 21.9 years. Participants completed an online survey consisting of the multidimensional perfectionism scale (mps; hewitt & flett, 1991); a qualitative questionnaire exploring participant attitudes about goals and success, experiences with success and failure, relationships with caregivers, and self-perceptions; and a demographic questionnaire. Responses were grouped into one of four categories based on participant mps scores self-oriented perfectionists (14 participants), socially prescribed perfectionists (13 participants), high self-oriented/high socially prescribed perfectionists (16 participants), and non-perfectionists (15 participants) and then analyzed using an abbreviated version of grounded theory (corbin & strauss, 2014; willing, 2013). Findings were largely consistent with existing literature, particularly related to self-oriented perfectionists' focus on personal standards, how heavily attitudes and expectations of others influenced socially prescribed perfectionists, and the differential impact of parental flexibility and support versus harsh demands and criticism. The inclusion of non-perfectionists and individuals high in both types of perfectionism allowed for novel findings including strong similarities in the attitudes and experiences of non-perfectionists and self-oriented perfectionists, and that self-oriented characteristics may mitigate socially-prescribed characteristics for individuals high in both types of perfectionism resulting in less distress than typically assumed. Areas for future exploration were also identified, including how the development of perfectionism is impacted by having caregivers who were raised outside of the u.s., by being able to experience pride or ownership in successes, or by the degree of personal and caregiver acceptance in response to failures.

Using an internet-based approach, we compared attribution responses of 376 women with orgasmic difficulty with 367 women without orgasmic difficulty to five sexual scenarios, two presenting positive sexual experiences and three presenting negative sexual experiences. Women with orgasmic difficulty were more likely to take blame for any negative sexual experience, including ones not related to orgasmic difficulty. They were also more likely to attribute responsibility to their partner's lack of skill, whereas orgasmic women attributed negative outcomes more to circumstance. Women with orgasmic difficulty were also less likely to assume credit or responsibility for positive sexual experiences. Differences between orgasmic and non-orgasmic groups persisted or were augmented when age and arousal difficulty were controlled. These results emphasize the stark contrast in the way women with and without orgasmic problems approach sexual situations and suggest several therapeutic strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Orgasm,,

In the present study, we show that individuals experiencing depressive symptoms largely ignore previously high-value stimuli, suggesting that such stimuli are less attention-grabbing in depression. This sharp contrast to the pattern of performance observed in prior studies and replicated here in the control participants indicates that depression is accompanied by changes in how the attention system is shaped by reward information. The findings of the present study demonstrate a link between depressive symptoms and value-based attention. The attention system of depressed individuals exhibits an apparent hyposensitivity to the reward history of visual objects. The findings provide further insight into how cognitive processes are affected in depression. The present study also indicates a direct relationship between value-based attention and the normal processing of reward information, as predicted by a distinctly value-driven mechanism of attentional control (psycinfo database record (c) 2016 apa, all rights reserved)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ATTRIBUTION;DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS;VALUE-BASED ATTENTION;COGNITIVE PROCESSES;ATTENTION;MAJOR DEPRESSION;SYMPTOMS,,

This gap is particularly noted in working with jewish ultra-orthodox psychiatric patients whose idioms of distress are often derived from a sacred reality not easily reconcilable with psychomedical reality. To meet the challenge to therapeutic efficacy that this incompatibility may pose, we propose a culturally sensitive therapy based on strategic principles that focus on the patient's mythic world and religious idioms of distress as the kernel of therapeutic interventions. Using one case of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) as illustration, we seek to show how the religious symbols through which the patient's distress was articulated may be manipulated to effect cure.

Understanding how some individual-related factors affect menstrual attitudes has substantial implications for coping with difficulties that come with it. We tested the direct and interactive effect of anxiety and body esteem dimensions (attribution, weight & appearance) on dimensions of menstrual attitudes (debilitating, bothersome, natural, prediction & denial) among adolescent girls in ibadan, nigeria. This is a cross- sectional survey of 276 secondary schools girls aged 12–19 years (m = 14.89, sd = 1.46). Multivariate analysis of variance results revealed adolescent girls with lower anxiety reported positive menstrual attitude by anticipating the onset of menstruation. Body esteem-appearance directly influenced both debilitating and bothersome dimensions of menstrual attitude; suggesting girls with higher body esteem for appearance positively accept menstrual experience as weakening and inconvenient. Interactively, anxiety and appearance dimension of body esteem influenced prediction dimension; likewise anxiety, weight and attribution dimensions of body esteem. It is concluded that body esteem and less anxiety are important for adolescent girls’ positive menstrual attitudinal change. Thus, reduced apprehension and high self-respect for body appearance and weight are recommended for accepting menstruation as a normal bodily function occurrence during a woman’s reproductive lifespan.

Individuals identified with adhd during adulthood may be at risk for maladaptive attributional styles based on the notion that they were exposed to more negative feedback during childhood than adults without identified adhd. This study examined current attributions and perceptions of childhood of 51 women identified in adulthood with adhd symptomatology and 51 nonadhd women. Women with adhd symptomatology had more uncontrollable, stable, and global attributions, reported more dissatisfaction in their childhood parent, peer, and teacher relationships, and felt less in control of negative childhood events as compared with the nonadhd women. Both depression and adhd contributed significantly to these group differences, suggesting that negative perceptions and attributions are more than reflections of current thinking and mood. Adhd symptomatology also may be an important risk factor for maladaptive attributions. (C) 2000 john wiley \& sons, inc.

Implementation scientists distinguish an intervention's essential components (thought to cause clinical change) and adaptable periphery (recommended, but not necessary). While implementing core components with fidelity may be essential for effectiveness, requiring fidelity to the adaptable periphery may stifle innovation critical for personalizing care and achieving successful community implementation. No systematic method exists for defining essential components a priori. We present the core (components \& rationales for effectiveness) fidelity method-a novel method for defining key components of evidence-based interventions-and apply it to a case example of reciprocal imitation teaching, a parent-implemented social communication intervention. The core fidelity method involves three steps: (1) gathering information from published and unpublished materials; (2) synthesizing information, including empirical and hypothesized causal explanations of component effectiveness; and (3) drafting a core model and ensuring its ongoing use in implementation efforts. Benefits of this method include: (1) ensuring alignment between intervention and fidelity materials; (2) clarifying the scope of the adaptable periphery to optimize implementation; and (3) hypothesizing-and later, empirically validating-the intervention's active ingredients and their associated mechanisms of change. Lay abstract interventions that support social communication include several ``components,'' or parts (e.g. Strategies for working with children and families, targeting specific skills). Some of these components may be essential for the intervention to work, while others may be recommended or viewed as helpful but not necessary for the intervention to work. ``recommended'' components are often described as ``adaptable'' because they can be changed to improve fit in different settings where interventions are offered or with different individuals. We need to understand which parts of an intervention are essential (and which are adaptable) when translating interventions from research to community settings, but it is challenging to do this before studying an intervention in the community. This article presents the core (components \& rationales for effectiveness) fidelity method-a new method for defining the essential components of evidence-based interventions-and applies it to a case example of reciprocal imitation teaching, an intervention that parents are taught to deliver with their young children with social communication delays.

This research examined relations between parents' beliefs and attitudes and their experiences with different treatments for their children's adhd. Methods: canadian parents of 73, 5- to 13-year-old, boys with adhd completed questionnaires measuring beliefs about adhd, attributions for adhd behaviours, and treatment experiences. Results: parents reported using primarily behaviour management and stimulant medications in treating adhd. Approximately half of the families also used diet/vitamin therapies. Parents were knowledgeable about adhd and held generally accurate beliefs. They saw adhd symptoms as predominantly internal to the child and as relatively enduring and pervasive. Parents' beliefs were related to their use of different treatments and parents who used less empirically supported treatments were more likely to see adhd behaviours as internal to the child, enduring and pervasive. Conclusions: the findings highlight the importance of assessing parents' use of alternate treatments for adhd and the potential role of parents' beliefs and attributions in shaping treatment choices.

The objectives of this study were to explore patient's own beliefs about their illness (schizophrenia) and perceived social support, and its impact on their attitudes toward pharmacological treatment in lahore, pakistan. Methods: this study was conducted at mayo hospital lahore from march to september 2016. Hundred individuals suffering from schizophrenia completed four questionnaires; a socio-demographic questionnaire, the illness perception questionnaire for schizophrenia (ipq-s), drug attitude inventory-10 (dai) and multidimensional scale of perceived social support (pss). Results: stress, family problems, lack of friends \& financial worries were endorsed strongly by patients as cause of their mental illness. Ambiguity regarding their mental illness duration and personal control was observed. Patients' perceived significant negative consequences, negative emotional response, as well as had poor understanding of their mental illness and treatment effectiveness. Statistically significant gender differences in treatment control and illness coherence subscales of ipqs were observed. Drug attitude inventory was positively correlated with treatment control subscale (p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with illness coherence subscale of ipqs (p < 0.05).

The purposes of this study were to examine different cancer beliefs and disparities in cancer beliefs across groups of individuals with distinct cancer histories and to identify whether cancer history predicts a set of cancer beliefs. Methods: using leventhal’s common sense model and data from the 2007 health information national trends survey (n = 7,172), we constructed multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the effect of different stimuli, including cancer experience on cancer perceptions (e.g., prevention, causation, outcome, worry). Results: findings indicated significant associations between cancer history and cancer perceptions. Individuals with family and personal cancer histories were more likely than individuals without any cancer history to worry about getting cancer (or = 3.55, 95 %ci = 2.53-4.99), agree they will develop cancer in the future (or = 8.81, 95%ci = 6.12-12.67) and disagree that cancer is most often caused by a person’s behavior or lifestyle (or = 1.24, 95 %ci = 1.01-1.52). Conclusions: cancer history affects perceptions throughout the cancer continuum. Additionally, cancer history may influence coping behaviors and outcomes. Cancer education and survivorship programs should assess important variables such as cancer history to more effectively tailor services and monitor evolving needs throughout cancer care. Implications for cancer survivors: integrating cancer history information into patient education programs tailored to an individual’s needs may better empower survivors and their family members to effectively promote informed decision-making about screening and preventive health behaviors, manage cancer worry, and enhance quality of life.

This study tested the construct and concurrent validity of a 17-item french version of the scale and explored its relations with psychological adjustment and with adaptation assessed two years later. In a sample of 157 women diagnosed with a first breast cancer, the french version was administered along with the body image questionnaire, the state-trait anxiety inventory, the perceived stress scale, the social support questionnaire, and the ways of coping checklist. A factor analysis performed on scores identified the three original factors: internal causal attribution, control over the course of the illness, and religious control. Internal causal attribution was associated with high scores for state and trait anxiety, negative body image, emotion-focused coping, and problem-focused coping. Control over the course of the cancer was positively associated with scores on both problem- and emotion-focused coping. Religious control was negatively associated with perceived stress. Emotional adjustment and quality of life were assessed in 59 of the 157 breast cancer patients two years after diagnosis and original testing. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that internal causal attribution significantly predicted 38.1\% of the variance in rated state anxiety.

Two field studies, one large (n=679) and cross-sectional, the other small (n=60) and longitudinal, tested this premise. Confirming hypotheses, the perceived controllability of an attribution proved essential to prediction and attributions for coping failures proved superior to attributions for stressful events as predictors.

According to the common-sense model of illness representations (csm), individuals' beliefs about their illness condition guide their attempts to cope with it. The model suggests five dimensions of illness representations: beliefs regarding the identity of the symptoms, its duration, causes, consequences, and one's ability to achieve control over it. Aims: the study aimed to explore the validity of the csm-dimensions of illness representations for children with adhd, while also exploring the possible relationships between types of beliefs and coping strategies. Method: a deductive qualitative content analysis was used for analyzing data constructed from semi-structured individual interviews with 14 children diagnosed with adhd. Results: the results have shown that there is a variation in children's beliefs regarding their adhd. Those beliefs are, for the most part, captured by the five csm-dimensions. An additional dimension of `uniqueness' is suggested, which reflects children's beliefs on the way adhd distinguishes them from other children. Patterns regarding types of beliefs and types of coping strategies were identified. Conclusions: the csm is a useful theoretical model to understand children's beliefs of, and coping with their adhd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,ADHD;CHILDREN;COMMON-SENSE MODEL;COPING;ILLNESS REPRESENTATIONS;;QUALITATIVE STUDY;Only Child;Child,,

The latter suggestion, however, is not easy to follow when the patients' subjective goals and desires diverge from the clinical goal of returning the patients to a normal way of life, as is the case with the so-called factitious disorders. The problem is worsened by the theory-ladenness of the interpretations of patients' first-person narratives. This paper argues against a common assumption that biases our understanding of abnormal behavior, in particular the behavior of those who feign illness. The assumption in question is the following: that such behavior satisfies certain - possibly unknown psychological needs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,UNDERSTANDING MENTAL DISORDERS;NARRATIVE TURN IN PSYCHIATRY;;THEORY-LADENNESS OF UNDERSTANDING;FIRST-PERSON NARRATIVES;FACTITIOUS;DISORDERS;SELF-ENGAGING BEHAVIOR;Factitious Disorders,,

Method: three experiments were conducted online with u.s. Adults, using vignettes that described a child with adhd and attributed his symptoms to either biological or psychosocial causes. Dependent measures gauged social distance and expectations about the child's prognosis. Results: across all three studies, the biological explanation yielded more doubt about treatability but less social distancea result that diverges from previous research with other disorders. Differences in the amount of blame ascribed to the child mediated the social distance effect.

Analysis of the vignette-identification data showed that participants were significantly less likely to correctly identify a case of psychopathy than they were of either depression or schizophrenia. Factors derived from principal components analysis of the attitudinal items revealed that participants generally believed psychopaths to be intelligent and to have criminal tendencies, and that psychopathy was likely caused by early trauma and stress. Overall, participants may have had monological beliefs about the manifestations, aetiology, and treatments of psychopathy.

We describe the average representation of experienced hospital nurses (n=44) and the differences which they consider to exist between their own and their patients' points of view. Taking as our starting point the purpose of the care provided and the asymmetry of the carer/patient relationship, we hypothesize, on the one hand, that nurses will have a representation of their patients' state of health which is based on the care to be provided, with the factors determining the state of health being necessarily perceived as having a general impact on patients' fives while still being remediable, i.e. Capable of changing and being controlled by the provided care. On the other hand, we expect them to attribute a passive position and attitude to their patients, with the factors determining their state of health being necessarily perceived as being out of their own control. The results and the analysis of the representations reported as being those of the patients and their families seem to justify this perception and role of carer: the supposed representations of the latter would appear to be convergent but less focused on health problems and would tend to minimize the patient's involvement in particular when the state of health declines.

The present study tested the discriminant validity of the anxiety sensitivity model of panic by assessing the differential predictions of particular anxiety sensitivity domains. A factor analysis of the body sensations questionnaire indicated four nested anxiety sensitivity factors assessing fears of cardiopulmonary, dissociation, numbness, and gastrointestinal sensations. The symptoms assessed by each factor possess varying levels of correspondence to the sensations typically produced during a 35\% co2 inhalation (i.e., cardiopulmonary fears/high correspondence, dissociation fears/moderate correspondence, numbness fears/moderate correspondence, gastrointestinal fears/low correspondence). It was hypothesized that anxiety sensitivity to the high-correspondence sensations, compared to anxiety sensitivity to moderate- and low-correspondence sensations would predict greater fearful responding to a 35\% co2 challenge. Fifty-six participants meeting dsm-iv criteria for panic disorder completed a single vital capacity 35\% co2 challenge. Consistent with prediction, cardiopulmonary fears was the only index that predicted provocation-induced anxiety and symptoms.

Previous research indicates that attributions of criticism, the explanations individuals make about the intentions underlying relatives' criticism, may play a role in the perception of criticism. The goal of the present research was to explore the relationship between attributions of criticism and perceived criticism in undergraduate, community, and clinical samples. In chapter 1, we examined the longitudinal relationship between attributions and perceived constructive and destructive criticism in a sample of undergraduates. Results showed that positive attributions predicted increases in perceived constructive criticism, whereas negative attributions predicted increases in perceived destructive criticism over time. Conversely, destructive criticism predicted increases in negative attributions and decreases in positive attributions over time. In chapter 2, we examined the relationships among attributions, perceived constructive and destructive criticism, upset due to criticism, and warmth in a sample of black and white community participants and tested for differences across race. Results proved consistent across race: positive attributions were associated with greater perceived constructive criticism and less upset, whereas negative attributions were associated with greater perceived destructive criticism and upset. Warmth was related to greater perceived constructive criticism, less destructive criticism, and less upset. Blacks were less upset by relatives' criticism than whites if they perceived their relative to be warm. In chapter 3, we examined the relationships among attributions, perceived criticism, and upset due to criticism among individuals with anxiety disorders and those without psychopathology. Negative attributions were associated with greater global perceived criticism and upset due to criticism. Negative attributions also contributed to greater perceived criticism and upset over and above the effect of observer-rated criticism during a problem-solving interaction. Positive attributions were not significantly related to any perceived criticism or upset measure. These patterns were consistent across clinical and normal control groups. Taken together, results suggest that attributions of criticism play an important role in the perception of criticism and point to attributions as a potential target of interventions to reduce perceived criticism and upset and ultimately improve clinical outcomes for patients with psychological disorders.

Clinicians used terms such as ``sticky brains'' and ``sticky neurons'' to describe the perseverative thoughts and quirky behavior that characterized a sizable subset of the program's chronic pain patients who were believed to show signs of pdd, and consequently, did not respond well to treatment. Drawing on observations of clinical consultations, team meetings, and interviews with clinicians and families, i examine the meta-discursive processes by which clinical difficulties were inscribed onto difficult patients. Specifically, i demonstrate how discourse on sticky brains worked to re-classify challenging patients as psychologically abnormal, rationalizing their failed response to standard treatment. I argue that `stickiness' provides an appropriate metaphor not only for a particular neurobiological configuration, but also for challenging clinical encounters. By illuminating the interactional processes through which clinical difficulties are managed, interpreted, and explained, the paper advances anthropological theorizing on the performative work of diagnosis and institutionalized misrecognition.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,CLINICAL ETHNOGRAPHY;CHRONIC PAIN;AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS;;DIAGNOSIS;``DIFFICULT'' PATIENTS;Brain;Pain Clinics,,

These individuals were not more likely than those with low or moderate negative cognitive style to detect neutral and negative non-self-relevant words during this period. These data suggest that cognitive style modulates the saliency of material that is relevant to negative attributions, and these alterations in information processing may link cognitive style to development of depression.

Namely, philosophical-religious reasoning is a uniquely derived explanatory system anchored in intentionality that does not clearly involve behavior. The presence of an existential theory of mind (etom) suggests that individuals perceive some nondescript or culturally elaborated (e.g., god) psychological agency as having encoded communicative intentions in the form of life events, similar to a person encoding communicative intentions in deictic gestures. The emergence of etom is discussed from ontogenetic and phylogenetic perspectives; autism is examined to determine whether alternate core explanatory models (e.g., folk physics) are used by those with deficits in theory of mind to derive existential meaning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,
rayyan-984748911,The Violence Continuum: Australian Aboriginal Male Violence And Generational Post-Traumatic Stress,2022,1,1,NA,,,,,ATKINSON CL,,,,,"This research explores the contention that the history of widespread traumatic stressors and the generational transmission of these traumatic stressors throughout the australian aboriginal population are manifested in a series of social problems. The high levels of violence we are now witnessing in some aboriginal families and communities, which in turn contribute to the high incarceration rates of aboriginal men for violent crimes, are seen as one of the most serious symptoms resulting from these traumatic stressors. This research aimed to establish if aboriginal men who are considered violent have histories of traumatic stressors and demonstrate psychological symptoms associated with trauma stress, as well as whether they have experienced generational patterns of traumatic stressors and dysfunction.using a cross-cultural, multi-methodological, and multi-method indigenist approach, this research developed a cross-cultural instrument, capable of measuring traumatic stressors and trauma-related symptoms relevant to australian aboriginal peoples. This was then employed to investigate the relationship between violence and generational post-traumatic stress among 58 aboriginal males who had been incarcerated for committing violent crimes.the cross-cultural instrument, titled the 'australian aboriginal version of the harvard trauma questionnaire' (aavhtq), was developed in the first phase of the research. This was achieved through documenting trauma symptoms, as defined by the dsm-iii-r for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) including identifying specific cultural idioms of distress reactions and traumatic stressors relevant to australian aboriginal peoples, by extracting key themes through thematic analysis of major seminal reports and focus group discussions with key informants. The aavhtq was then field tested on 58 aboriginal men incarcerated for committing violent crimes to establish if the research participants met the clinical criteria for ptsd, and to investigate the nature, level of exposure and frequency of traumatic stressors experienced and to identify the prevalence of specific types of trauma symptoms. Additionally, the research explored patterns of generational trauma and violence through the construction of genohistograms obtained through semi-structured, in-depth interviews, which allowed detection of changes in the rates of traumatic stressors and dysfunctional behaviours between the current and older generations.the research found that over half (58.6%) of the study population were ptsd symptomatic (according to the aavhtq) and that the majority had been exposed to a significantly high number of traumatic stressors. The more traumatic stressors endorsed, or the more cumulative the amount of traumatic exposure, the more likely the participants were ptsd symptomatic. Research participants who endorsed traumatic stressors associated with low formal and informal social support and/or a lack of personal and social identity, and who had been sexually abused and/or suffered from symptoms associated with precarious mental health, low self-esteem and social isolation were significantly more likely to be ptsd symptomatic and appeared to resort to violence to release their trauma.qualitative and quantitative data highlighted the endemic nature and normalisation of family violence, grief and loss, and alcohol and drug misuse as both symptoms of and causes of traumatic stressors. Traumatic stressors relating to institutional violence, fractured families, acculturation (colonisation) and racism were also identified as significant traumatic stressors through the qualitative results. Significant increases in traumatic stressors and dysfunctional behaviours were also established in the research participants' current and older generational histograms, lending support for the notion of generational trauma and dysfunction.

Methods: ninety-seven participants were given vignettes of characters describing symptoms of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress. They were required to identify psychological symptoms as disorders, rate beliefs about the causes of and helpful treatments for these disorders, and rate attitude statements regarding the two characters. Results: australian participants recognized the presented symptoms as specific mental disorders significantly more than iraqi and sudanese participants did, and reported causal and treatment beliefs which were more congruent with expert beliefs as per the western medical model of mental disorder. The sudanese group endorsed supernatural and religious causal beliefs regarding depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms most often; but both sudanese and iraqi participants strongly supported options from the supernatural and religious treatment items. However, evidence for pluralistic belief systems was also found. Conclusions: although sampling was non-random, suggesting caution in the interpretation of results, it appears that the mental health literacy of lay australians may be more aligned with the western medical model of mental disorder than that of iraqi and sudanese refugee communities. Mental health literacy support needs of iraqi and sudanese refugee communities resettled in western countries such as australia might include education about specific symptoms and causes of mental disorder and the effectiveness of psychiatric treatments. These findings provide useful directions for the promotion of optimal service utilization among such communities.

However, while trauma and bereavement interlink, prior studies have focused on trauma and its related disorders (ptsd) and predictive factors. This paper reviewed upto-date literature on the prevalence rates of prolonged grief disorder (pgd), its comorbidities, and associated risk factors among adult refugees. Method: we systematically reviewed the literature using five databases (psycinfo, psycarticles, psychology and behavioral sciences collection, academic search elite, and pubmed). The process of study selection was designed according to prisma guidelines. Results: the initial search generated 126 articles, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of pgd was 33.2\% (95\% ci: 15.2-54.2\%). Being an older refugee, traumatic and multiple losses implying the death of first-degree relatives appeared to be consistent risk factors for pgd, combined ptsd/pgd, depression, idioms of distress, and functional impairment. Pgd, ptsd, and ptsd/pgd intersect on ptsd-intrusions and painful memories. Limitations: all included studies adopted a cross-sectional design, thus limiting the understanding of causal pathways. Conclusions: our findings showed that the high prevalence of pgd and related comorbidities were influenced by the load of traumatic circumstances surrounding the death(s). The findings shed light on the current proposed grief-related diagnostic criteria . Psychopathological and transcultural aspects are discussed, and we provide concrete recommendations for improvements to future research in this field.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,BEREAVEMENT;TRAUMA;GRIEF-RELATED DISORDERS;IMMIGRANT/REFUGEE/ASYLUM;SEEKER;PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;SYSTEMATIC REVIEW;Mental Disorders;Bereavement,,

This study examined whether the apparent absence of an egocentric bias among shy individuals is reflected in their excuse making following poor performance. It also examined whether anticipating a challenge to one's excuses would dissuade even nonshy individuals from making excuses. Shy and nonshy subjects received either success or failure feedback on an intelligence test and then were or were not told that they would be retested. Consistent with predictions, shy individuals refrained from making consistency-lowering excuses regardless of performance feedback and retest instructions. By contrast, nonshy subjects made consistency-lowering excuses after failure feedback, but only when they expected that their excuses would go unchallenged by a retest.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Composite sequence analysis resulted in a series of temporal networks to describe participants' cognitive, affective, and behavioural responses in a time-to-event paradigm. Match-related cognitions remained stable in the lead up to competition, while perceptions of physical symptoms peaked at the onset of performance. Affective responses were associated with feelings of anxiety and tension in the early temporal phases but excitement confidence, and efficacy in team-mates directly before competition. Behavioural themes described activities associated with technical and physical preparation, familiarization with environmental conditions, and strategies to control activation states early on or directly before competition. The findings highlight the idiosyncratic and dynamic nature of the temporal patterning of precompetitive responses and the influence that perceptions of the team have upon individual preparation for performance.

As patient involvement is a prerequisite for treatment, it seems crucial to assess psychosocial aspects, including patient's cognitive component of attitude towards the condition, as early as upon diagnosis. The aim of this study was to examine whether the cognitive illness representation in older female and male patients with type 2 diabetes is differentiated. Considering disease duration, we determined the effect of cognitive illness representation on older diabetes emotional wellbeing.; Methods: the study in 99 older adults with type 2 diabetes used disease-related appraisals scale (skala oceny wlasnej choroby; sowch) to assess cognitive illness representation and state-trait anxiety inventory (stai) to assess the severity of state anxiety.; Results: in a subgroup with short-standing diagnosis, women scored significantly higher than men on subscales of threat, obstacle/loss and profit. In a subgroup with long-standing diagnosis, women scored significantly higher than men on the subscale of threat and significantly lower than men on the subscale of value. The associations between the individual dimensions of cognitive illness representation and anxiety were also determined. These correlations differed between sexes and stages of the disease.; Conclusion: both at early and late stages of type 2 diabetes, women perceive their illness as a threat significantly more than men do. This appraisal persists throughout the entire duration of the illness. Men with long-standing diagnosis, attribute higher value to diabetes than women do, perceiving it as an opportunity to appreciate values they did not pay attention to before. Anxiety reported by older women and men can be explained to a significant extent by certain dimensions of their respective cognitive illness representation.

Differently activated regions are often ascribed disorder-specific functions in an attempt to link disease expression and brain function. We undertook a systematic meta-analysis of data from task-fmri studies to examine the effect of diagnosis and study design on the spatial distribution and direction of case-control differences on brain activation. We mapped to atlas regions coordinates of case-control differences derived from 537 task-fmri studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder comprising observations derived from 21,427 participants. The fmri tasks were classified according to the research domain criteria (rdoc). We investigated whether diagnosis, rdoc domain or construct and use of regions-of-interest or whole-brain analyses influenced the neuroanatomical pattern of results. When considering all primary studies, we found an effect of diagnosis for the amygdala and caudate nucleus and an effect of rdoc domains and constructs for the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen and nucleus accumbens. In contrast, whole-brain studies did not identify any significant effect of diagnosis or rdoc domain or construct. These results resonate with prior reports of common brain structural and genetic underpinnings across these disorders and caution against attributing undue specificity to brain functional changes when forming explanatory models of psychiatric disorders.

However, there are few studies exploring patients' causal beliefs about their mental disorder. Objectives (a) to qualitatively explore patients' causal beliefs of their mental disorder, (b) to explore frequencies of patients stating causal beliefs, and (c) to investigate differences of causal beliefs according to patients' primary diagnoses. Method inpatients in psychosomatic rehabilitation were asked an open-ended question about their three most important causal beliefs about their mental illness. Answers were obtained from 678 patients, with primary diagnoses of depression (n = 341), adjustment disorder (n = 75), reaction to severe stress (n = 57) and anxiety disorders (n = 40). Two researchers developed a category system inductively and categorised the reported causal beliefs. Qualitative analysis has been supplemented by logistic regression analyses. Results the causal beliefs were organized into twelve content-related categories. Causal beliefs referring to ``problems at work'' (47\%) and ``problems in social environment'' (46\%) were most frequently mentioned by patients with mental disorders. 35\% of patients indicate causal beliefs related to ``self/internal states''. Patients with depression and patients with anxiety disorders stated similar causal beliefs, whereas patients with reactions to severe stress and adjustment disorders stated different causal beliefs in comparison to patients with depression. Limitations there was no opportunity for further exploration, because we analysed written documents. Conclusions these results add a detailed insight to mentally ill patients' causal beliefs to illness perception literature. Additionally, evidence about differences in frequencies of causal beliefs between different illness groups complement previous findings. For future research it is important to clarify the relation between patients' causal beliefs and the chosen treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,NA;Mental Disorders,,

Participants (n = 214) rated causal attributions to others and blaming others, and completed five measures of adjustment: anger, anxiety, depression, parenting stress, and attitudes towards the child. The adjustment of three groups of mothers was compared: (i) those who made no attributions to others (ii) those who made causal attributions but did not blame, and (iii) those who blamed others. Four years after the births of their children with ds, 16% of mothers blamed others and 17% made causal attributions but did not blame others for this outcome. Those who blamed others had higher levels of anger, anxiety, depression, parenting stress and more negative attitudes towards their children with ds than did those who made causal attributions but did not blame, and those who made who made no attributions to others. The adjustment of the latter two groups did not differ. Investigating blame rather than causal attributions may be a more fruitful area for future research aimed at understanding and facilitating adjustment to illness and other negative life events.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Economic Inequality, External Attributions Of Wealth And Poverty, And The Belief In Economic Mobility",2018,1,1,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,DAVIDAI S,,,,,"Although the rates of economic inequality in the united states are at their highest since the onset of the great depression, many americans do not seem as concerned as may be expected. This apparent lack of concern has been attributed to people's deeply-entrenched belief in economic mobility—the belief that through hard work, determination, and skill people are able to rise up the economic ladder. Little is known, however, about why americans so strongly believe in economic mobility. In five studies (n = 3112, including two pre-registered studies, one with a large, income-stratified sample), i examine the relationship between economic inequality and the belief in economic mobility. I find that people (accurately) perceive a negative relationship between economic inequality and economic mobility, and that this is due to the attributions they make about wealth and poverty. As economic inequality rises, people increasingly attribute economic success and failure to external factors that are beyond a person's control (vs. Internal dispositions), and therefore expect economic mobility to drop. As a consequence, people's tendency to underestimate economic inequality reinforces their belief in economic mobility. I discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of lay beliefs about the economic system and public opinion regarding inequality.

The reasons for the delay in help-seeking are not known, although studies show multiple reasons. This research was conducted to establish health care help-seeking behaviours and identify barriers that exist between service users and health care providers. The study also intended to establish the beliefs that clients and family members have regarding the causes of mental illness which profoundly shape help-seeking, care giving process and outcomes. Methodology: the study employed the exploratory phenomenological method, utilizing focus group discussions (fgds) in the sampled population. The health belief model and disease explanatory models were conveniently chosen a priori by researchers to develop guide questions to explore clients' and carers' perceptions of the illness and their health care help-seeking behaviours. Results: results show a bio-psycho-social inclination of disease causation and help-seeking behaviour. Causes of mental illness are understood in three categories, namely: physical/biological, psychological and socio-cultural. The majority of participants attributed mental illness to socio-cultural factors, with witchcraft, spirit possession and curses as main determinants. Causal perceptions also influenced help-seeking pathways. Many participants reported consulting traditional healers first, for diagnosis and to know who was responsible. Conclusion: in this study, it has been found that help-seeking is influenced by the understanding of the source of the illness - which has a bio-psychosocial inclination. The socio-cultural explanation of witchcraft and spirit possession is dominant and a determinant of help-seeking behaviour. While participants noted benefits to hospital treatment, barriers and bio-psychosocial in nature were also noted. Guardians and not clients hold the key to choice of treatment modality and therefore a potential ally in all treatment interventions promotive, preventive and curative.

Psychological research shows that children who tend to think optimistically have certain advantages as compared to their pessimistically thinking peers: they are less likely to suffer from depression, establish more positive relationships with peers, and demonstrate higher academic achievements. This paper describes the process of creating the children’s version of the optimistic attributional style questionnaire (oasq-c). This technique is based on the theory of learned hopelessness and optimism developed by m. Seligman, l. Abramson and j. Teasdale and is an efficient (compact) tool for measuring optimism as an explanatory style in children and adolescents (9-14 years). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that this technique is a two-factor structure with acceptable reliability. Validity is supported by the presence of expected correlations between explanatory style and rates of psychological well-being, dispositional optimism, positive attitude to life and its aspects, depression, and academic performance. The outcomes of this technique are not affected by social desirability. The developed questionnaire may be recommended to researchers and school counsellors for evaluating optimism (optimistic thinking) as one of the major factors in psychological well-being of children; it may also be used in assessing the effectiveness of cognitive oriented training for adolescents.

There is growing interest in these molecules and their receptors as potential precipitants of, and/or treatments for, social deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. Numerous behavioral-genetic studies suggest that there is an association between these peptides and individual social abilities; however, an explanatory model that links hormonal activity at the receptor level to complex human behavior remains elusive. The following review summarizes the known associations between the oxytocin and vasopressin neuropeptide systems and social neurocircuits in the brain. Following a micro- to macro- level trajectory, current literature on the synthesis and secretion of these peptides, and the structure, function and distribution of their respective receptors is first surveyed. Next, current models regarding the mechanism of action of these peptides on microcircuitry and other neurotransmitter systems are discussed. Functional neuroimaging evidence on the acute effects of exogenous administration of these peptides on brain activity is then reviewed.

Emerging research indicates ptsd and sdb may co-occur more frequently than expected and may impact clinical outcomes. This review describes historical developments that first raised suspicions for a co-morbid relationship between ptsd and sdb, including barriers to the recognition and diagnosis of this co-morbidity. Objective diagnostic data from poly-somnography studies in ptsd patients reveal widely varying prevalence rates for co-morbidity (0-90\%). Use of standard, recommended technology (nasal cannula pressure transducer) versus older, less reliable technology (thermistor/thermocouple) appears to have influenced objective data acquisition and therefore sdb rates in sleep studies on ptsd patients. Studies using higher quality respiratory sensors demonstrated the highest prevalence of sdb in ptsd patients. Clinical relevance, theoretical models and research recommendations are discussed. The lack of widely acknowledged, tested, or proven explanatory models and pathophysiological mechanisms to understand the relationship between these two disorders may prove formidable barriers to further investigations on prevalence and clinical relevance, albeit both conditions are associated with waking or sleeping hyperarousal activity, which may inform future studies.

Seventy aboriginal people were interviewed about their beliefs and attitudes towards mental health, western psychology and western practitioners, and strategies for improving mental health care delivery. The study highlights that participants consistently perceived the course and treatment of depression as following a different aetiology to that of mainstream australia. The authors' references to depression do not conform with eurocentric perceptions, but rather to the aboriginal australians' conceptualisation, as explained within the paper. Almost three in four respondents indicated that they believed that aboriginal people did not perceive depression as a state that could be addressed via treatment. Instead they perceived it as a characteristic of the individual concerned stating 'that's just the way he is'. Subsequently they reported that individuals might not get the assistance they require in overcoming their illness.

We found overwhelming support for this relationship; further, we found that it was moderated by age and gender, with only adults having a significant correlation between global causes and depression, adolescents obtaining a stronger correlation between composite causes and depression compared to adults and children, and girls/women having a stronger correlation between all four causes and depression compared to boys/men. Our findings suggest that the effect of individuals’ attributional style involving global and composite causes on depression may differ according to age, and that girls/women are more likely to be affected by all four causes.

When individuals engage in an activity, they may attribute their outcomes to the operation of one or more causal forces. A growing body of research, stemming partly from scholar f. Heider's analysis of phenomenal causality, has focused on the conditions which influence the tendency to ascribe responsibility to personal forces or to impersonal forces over which the individual has little control. For example, attribution of responsibility has been shown to be related to the nature of the outcome, the discrepancy between expected and actual outcome and to personality variables such as self-esteem, need achievement, need approval and test anxiety. One personality dimension which would appear to play a major role in influencing the nature of causal attributions is internal-external control of reinforcement. The internal-external control of reinforcement variable represents a generalized expectancy that reinforcement is causally related to one's own behavior. At one end of the internal-external control of reinforcement dimension are individuals who believe that reinforcement is contingent upon their behavior, while those at the other extreme believe that reinforcement is independent of their actions and is controlled by chance or powerful others.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,FEAR OF SUCCESS;ANXIETY;BEHAVIOR;EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY;TEST ANXIETY;PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS;PHOBIAS,,

This article reviews research addressing relatives' causal attributions, expressed emotion, and patient relapse, which support a model in which relatives' attributions are causally related to expressed emotion. A mediational model of attribution-expressed emotion outcome is evaluated as a theoretical framework to understand how attributions and expressed emotion contribute to patient relapse. Relatives of patients with schizophrenia in china demonstrated a more situational attribution bias than relatives of patients from western cultures, yet chinese relatives' controllable and personal attributions still related to high expressed emotion types of criticism and hostility. Hostility. Expressed emotion partially mediated controllability attributions in predicting relapse. Personal attributions, particularly relatives' causal beliefs of 'xiao xin yan' ('narrow-mindedness'), protected against relapse in a manner unexplained by expressed emotion. Results support the hypothesised causal relation between attributions and expressed emotion, and suggest ways to explore how relatives' behaviours ameliorate patient illness course.

Some overlap between these conditions and schizophrenia (dsm-iv) is apparent. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which amafufunyana and ukuthwasa were used as cultural explanatory models by traditional healers for dsm-iv-defined schizophrenia and whether there were significant phenomenological differences in schizophrenia symptoms in patients with the diagnosis of amafufunyana rather than ukuthwasa. Sampling and methods: xhosa patients with schizophrenia underwent a structured clinical diagnostic interview ( diagnostic interview for genetic studies). The use of traditional diagnostic and treatment methods was assessed by structured open-ended interviewer-rated questions. The sample was then stratified for the presence/ absence of a past/current diagnosis of amafufunyana and/or ukuthwasa. The clinical parameters were compared across groups by means of the chi(2) or student t tests. Results: 247 adult subjects participated in the study. 106 (53\%) patients reported a previous diagnosis of amafufunyana, and 9 (4.5\%) reported a diagnosis of ukuthwasa. A family history of schizophrenia ( p = 0.004) or any psychiatric disorder ( p = 0.008) was more common in the ukuthwasa group. Subjects with a primary diagnosis other than amafufunyana or ukuthwasa were more likely to be married ( p = 0.004), to have a history of stressor(s) prior to illness onset ( p = 0.026), to be from a rural environment ( p = 0.007) or to have a history of cannabis abuse/dependency ( p = 0.015). Conclusion: the culture-bound syndrome amafufunyana and the culture-specific phenomenon of ukuthwasa are both used to explain symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (dsm-iv). Identification of cases as amafufunyana and ukuthwasa may correlate with a distinction between familial and sporadic cases of schizophrenia. Whether the positive connotations associated with ukuthwasa, as opposed to the more negative connotations associated with amafufunyana, hold any implications for the treatment or prognosis of schizophrenia remains to be clarified.

Whereas paternal investment theory posits that this effect is causal, it could arise from environmental or genetic confounds. To distinguish between these competing explanations, the current authors employed a genetically and environmentally controlled sibling design (n = 101 sister pairs; ages 18-36), which retrospectively examined the effects of differential sibling exposure to family disruption/father absence and quality of fathering. Consistent with a causal explanation, differences between older and younger sisters in the effects of quality of fathering on rsb were greatest in biologically disrupted families when there was a large age gap between the sisters (thus maximizing differential exposure to fathers), with greater exposure within families to higher quality fathering serving as a protective factor against rsb. Further, variation around the lower end of fathering quality appeared to have the most influence on rsb. In contrast, differential sibling exposure to family disruption/father absence (irrespective of quality of fathering) was not associated with rsb. The differential sibling-exposure design affords a new quasi-experimental method for evaluating the causal effects of fathers within families.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,FATHER-CHILD RELATIONS*;RISK-TAKING*;FATHERS/*PSYCHOLOGY;NUCLEAR FAMILY/*PSYCHOLOGY;PARENTING/*PSYCHOLOGY;SEXUAL BEHAVIOR/*PSYCHOLOGY;ADOLESCENT;ADULT;FEMALE;HUMANS;MALE;SIBLINGS/PSYCHOLOGY;Sexual Behavior;Nuclear Family,,

Biomedical psychiatrists understand patients' symptoms as manifestations of the excessive worry associated with generalized anxiety disorder (gad). Drawing on an ethnopsychology of emotion that reflects increasingly popular models of neoliberal selfhood, these psychiatrists encourage patients to frame psychic distress in terms of private feelings to address the conditions in their lives that lead to chronic anxiety. However, most patients attribute their symptoms to neurasthenia instead of gad. Differences between doctors' and patients' explanatory models are not just rooted in their understandings of illness but also in their respective conceptualizations of worry in terms of emotion and sentiment. Patients with neurasthenia reject doctors' attempts to psychologize distress and maintain a model of worry that supports a sense of moral selfhood based on notions of obligation and sacrifice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,"NEURASTHENIA;GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER;WORRY;ANXIETY;SELFHOOD;;VIETNAM;Anxiety Disorders;Hospitals, Psychiatric;Anxiety",,

The ideas of the proponents of postpsychiatry, first of all of patrick bracken and philip thomas, have much in common with the ideas of antipsychiatrists. Thus both antipsychiatrists and postpsychiatrists question the validity of the biomedical model, criticise positivism and reductionism of modern psychiatry, disapprove of decontextualisation when diagnosing mental disorders and point out the downsides of the 'great confinement' as well as other repressive aspects of psychiatric practice. Nevertheless, there is something specific to postpsychiatric concepts. Postpsychiatrists campaign for deprofessionalisation, that is, depsychiatrisation, and in the last instance demedicalisation of psychiatry-; in any case they do it much more than other critical psychiatrists. Postpsychiatrists identified the biomedical model as the major stumbling block on the way to a better psychiatry. That is why they disputed nearly all aspects of psychiatry that they perceived as medically based, such as diagnosis and treatment of people with mental disorder. As for diagnosis postpsychiatrists argue that psychiatrists first should grasp social and cultural context and then seek to identify symptoms, and explain and understand them. The presumption of such a sequence of diagnostic activities is that the origin of mental disorders is in the social context, a proposition that is largely doubtful. Furthermore, postpsychiatrists maintain that hermeneutic exploration of meaning, significance and value should always precede the move to causal explanation. The guess is that if exercised such a diagnostic practice might endanger a patient's life. Eventually postpsychiatrists contend that diagnosis is the matter of negotiation between client and psychiatrists, and that psychiatrists should restrain from imposing on clients the psychiatric view of the what, how and whence of clients' mental experience. Commenting on the proposal that psychiatric patients and professionals equally share the task of developing psychiatric diagnosis, spitzer rightly observed that it would be a recipe for nosologic disaster. In regard to the treatment of mental disorders postpsychiatrists do not dispute the efficacy of drugs such as for example antidepressants. However, their point is that antidepressants have no effect on neurotransmitters. It is hope, the mustering of courage and generation of motivation that incur neurotransmitters' changes. Postpsychiatrists also put in question the usual meaning of recovery: a reduction in the number and intensity of symptoms. According to postpsychiatrists recovery is what those having for example voices and unusual beliefs think recovery is. If they are happy with those experiences, there should not be any treatment. There is nothing they might be recovered from; except from silence imposed on them by modern-day psychiatry. In conclusion, there are many imperfections of the medical mind, as there are many critical issues of contemporary psychiatry. The claim that the biomedical model is or should be the only legitimate psychiatric model is unfounded. So is any attempt to challenge its validity or to dismiss it altogether. Psychiatry should not be reduced to the medical approach. However, psychiatry cannot do without the medical mind, either. Psychiatrists are more familiar with the medical mind than other members of a multi-professional team. That is why in the diagnostic procedure and the treatment of people with mental disorder psychiatrists should not be sidelined by (former) mental patients (service users), other professionals and paraprofessionals.

Specifically, the amount of information given teachers was examined as it impacted: 1. Teachers' causal attributions, 2. Their ability to identify specific emotional problems, and 3. Their ability to choose accommodations recommended for students with ptsd. An online survey format was used to randomly assign 236 teachers to one of three levels of information about a hypothetical student namely, 1) description of behavioral and academic difficulties in the classroom (behavioral descriptors), 2) behavioral descriptors plus information about trauma exposure and diagnosis of ptsd (ptsd diagnosis), and 3) behavioral descriptors, ptsd diagnosis plus outcomes associated with ptsd (ptsd outcomes). Increased levels of information resulted in a significant increase in accurate identification of the cause of student difficulties overall. Regarding ability to identify specific emotional diagnoses, teachers' ability to identify ptsd as the accurate emotional problem represented was also significantly more likely with increased levels of information. However, the likelihood of teachers to identify accommodations recommended for students with ptsd was not significantly impacted by increased levels of information. Results indicated that teachers make more accurate causal attributions about students with ptsd with increased information, but this does not result in increased ability to identify classroom accommodations that are recommended for students with ptsd.

Many people with mental illness do not seek professional help. Beliefs about the causes of their current health problem seem relevant for initiating treatment. Our aim was to find out to what extent the perceived causes of current untreated mental health problems determine whether a person considers herself/himself as having a mental illness, perceives need for professional help and plans to seek help in the near future. Methods. In a cross-sectional study, we examined 207 untreated persons with a depressive syndrome, all fulfilling criteria for a current mental illness as confirmed with a structured diagnostic interview (mini international neuropsychiatric interview). The sample was recruited in the community using adverts, flyers and social media. We elicited causal explanations for the present problem, depression literacy, self-identification as having a mental illness, perceived need for professional help, help-seeking intentions, severity of depressive symptoms (patient health questionnaire - depression), and whether respondents had previously sought mental healthcare. Results. Most participants fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder (n = 181, 87.4\%) and/or neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (n = 120, 58.0\%) according to the icd-10. N = 94 (45.4\%) participants had never received mental health treatment previously. Exploratory factor analysis of a list of 25 different causal explanations resulted in five factors: biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma, current stress and unhealthy behaviour. Attributing the present problem to biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma and stress were all associated with stronger self-identification as having a mental illness. In persons who had never received mental health treatment previously, attribution to biomedical causes was related to greater perceived need and stronger help-seeking intentions. In those with treatment experience, lower attribution to person-related causes and stress were related to greater perceived need for professional help. Conclusions. While several causal explanations are associated with self-identification as having a mental illness, only biomedical attributions seem to be related to increase perceived need and help-seeking intentions, especially in individuals with no treatment experiences. Longitudinal studies investigating causal beliefs and help-seeking are needed to find out how causal attributions guide help-seeking behaviour. From this study it seems possible that portraying professional mental health treatment as not being restricted to biomedical problems would contribute to closing the treatment gap for mental disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,CAUSAL BELIEFS;MENTAL HEALTH;ATTITUDES;HELP-SEEKING;OTHER;PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES;Mentally Ill Persons,,

Thematic analysis was used to analyse data.; Results: the former were predominantly married, literate and employed; the latter were predominantly wives, literate and employed. Alcohol consumption and auds are seen to be mainly associated with psychosocial stress, with other factors being peer influences, availability of disposable income and drinking for pleasure. They are perceived to result in a range of adverse impacts on social life, family life, personal health and family finances. Various coping strategies were deployed by men with aud and their significant others, for example avoidance, substitution, distraction, religious activities, support from aa/friends/family, restricting means to buy alcohol and anger management. Reduction/cessation in drinking, improved family relationships, improved emotional/physical wellbeing and better occupational functioning were the most desired treatment outcomes.; Conclusion: there are considerable similarities, as well as some key differences, observed between the ems for aud in india and those reported from other cultures which have implications for the global applicability and contextual adaptations of evidence based interventions for aud.

Arseneault et al gave three plausible causal explanations for this association. First, that cannabis and/or related drug use is a causal factor for schizophrenia. Second, that the altered mental state induced by cannabis may be mistaken for schizophrenia. Third, that cannabis use may be increased in individuals with the premorbid features of schizophrenia. Arseneault et al believe that the evidence favours the first alternative, and we agree. However, we call attention to a fourth possibility. Consider two propositions: (a) features of schizophrenia such as negative symptoms and cognitive impairments precede the onset of psychosis and are considered early morbid rather than premorbid; and (b) schizophrenia is associated with high rates of substance misuse.

There are few studies exploring depressed patients' beliefs about the causes and to our knowledge none in a swedish population. However, previous studies show that the patients more often mention environmental and psychological causes than biological. The aim of this study was to further explore depressed patients' answers to an open-ended question about the etiology of their depression. Methods: primary care patients, participating in a study evaluating patient education, were asked an open-ended question about their beliefs about what had caused their depression. Answers were obtained from 303 patients. Results: the analysis of the patients' beliefs emerged into 16 different categories of explanations for depression that could be organized into three larger themes: current life stressors, past life events and constitutional factors. Work-related stress was the most commonly mentioned cause, followed by personality and current family situation. Only 3.6\% stated biological reasons. Limitations: we could only count the frequency of mentioned causes, but no ranking of the importance of these causes. Conclusions: primary care patients often gave multi-causal explanations to their depression. Biological explanations were rare. Their beliefs were predominantly current life stressors such as work or family situation and also their own personality. Patients' beliefs about their illness are important in the patient-doctor encounter, when developing new treatment strategies aiming at improved adherence to both psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments and also in patient education programs.

The saas and ssas were developed to allow students to rate success and failure due to internal causes, ability and effort, or external causes, chance and task difficulty, for typical school situations; also, optimism and pessimism global scales were calculated. Responses were compared to students' general attributions for success and failure on an established scale, the children's attribution style questionnaire and a correlational analysis was conducted. Secondly, both the saas and the ssas and the casq were used to predict depression in 70 4th through 6th grade students using the depression subscale of the behavior assessment system for children (basc). Results support anticipated relationships between the saas and ssas subscales and global scales of the casq subscales and global scales. Generally, the concurrent validity of the saas and ssas was established via the pattern of correlation with the scales of the casq. When global scales from the saas, ssas and the casq were evaluated for predictive capability, only the global scale from the saas and ssas combined (failure internal, consisting of failure ability and effort from both the saas and the ssas) demonstrated the ability to predict the basc depression scale to a significant degree (p < .05). Similarly, when global optimism and pessimism scales from the three instruments were compared for predictive utility, both pessimism failure social (ssas) and pessimism failure academic (saas) predicted depression scores to a significant degree (p < .05); the optimism-pessimism global scales from the casq did not predict depression to a significant degree in this study. The fact that the saas and ssas subscales correlated significantly with the well-established, but more clinically oriented casq demonstrates the utility of the saas and the ssas to assess attribution style with a general population from a school setting. The ability of the saas and ssas global scores to predict significantly depressive symptoms in school children indicate a link between attributions and depression.

The authors then carried out an analysis of the main topics, themes and questions covered in the selected publications and presented a descriptive synthesis. Results. - a total of seventy-seven publications were included in the analysis, from three hundred and seventy-two publications. First, the terms used to refer to these ``somatic symptom disorders'' were varied, such as ``somatization'' ``somatic complaints/symptoms'' ``functional disorder'' ``unexplained symptoms'' and ``somatoform disorders''. Then, studies related just to adolescents were limited: most of studies inclu-ded children and adolescents in their methodologies; and some of them questioned somatic symptoms from a developmental perspective. Case reports were the most represented articles among all medical spe-cialties, with clinical descriptions about ``functional neurological symptom disorder'' ``factitious disorder'' and ``somatic symptom disorder'' with a medical disease, among children and adolescents. We sometimes observed a controversial borderline between psychological and somatic disorders. Various explanatory models appeared, especially the trauma path; familial and social environment was also pointed out, with a possible peer group effect; neurocognitive theories were finally described. The literature highlights the effectiveness of psychosocial therapies (especially the cognitive-behavioral therapy) and the importance of multidisciplinary management. Finally, a few studies with a qualitative methodology are represented. Conclusions. - only nine articles included ``somatic symptom disorder'' in their titles, despite a terminology valued by many authors (compared to ``somatoform disorders'' from the dsm-iv). The heterogeneity of terminologies, case reports and explanatory models witness a lack of connexions between medical specialties. This could explain in part the wandering of adolescents and their families in the health care system. It could also contribute to the delay before diagnosis, especially when neurological symptoms exist, and a late referral for psychiatric consultation. Further studies are needed to understand difficulties to use a clinical pathway among medical specialties, when the benefit of amultidisciplinary approach seems to be unanimous.

Beliefs about the cause of the trauma, for instance, may include attributions of possessing spirits, and are to be found in an increasingly pluralistic and multicultural society.

Unwittingly, an overreliance on neurobiological explanations and relegation of cultural idioms of distress may diminish effective collaboration with ecclesiastical authorities. Concomitantly, ecclesiastical experts are confronted with bewildering posttrauma dissociative symptomatology, and may not be prepared as diagnosticians to rule out psychobiological explanations.

Impaired insight is seen in almost all patients with psychotic disorders at some point or other in time. Insight is a multi-dimensional concept, with at least four elements: lack of awareness about the illness, incorrect attribution of one’s experience, and a failure to appreciate need for treatment. Clearly, impairments in insight are an unmet therapeutic need in psychotic disorders. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the diverse components of impaired insight, which will then shed light into novel approaches to treatment.

rayyan-984748958,When Neurogenetics Hurts: Examining The Use Of Neuroscience And Genetic Evidence In Sentencing Decisions Through Implicit Bias,2015,1,1,CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW,,,,,PYUN J,,,,,"Courts increasingly use neuroscience and genetic evidence (''neurogenetic evidence'') to shed light on various aspects of a defendant's mental state and behavior. The evidence is particularly prevalent in cases involving defendants with mental illnesses and is used to determine issues of mental capacity, personal responsibility, and treatability. However, using neurogenetic evidence risks framing mental illness through a narrow explanatory model-one relying solely on biological causes. Such evidence elicits both stigma-reducing and stigma-enhancing implicit biases against mental illness, which can manifest themselves in beliefs that a person with mental illness is less blameworthy for his condition, but also more dangerous and less receptive to treatment. These implicit biases affect jurors (and potentially judges) and may influence sentencing decisions in cases involving defendants with mental illnesses, including ultimate sentencing decisions in capital cases. While there has been vast literature on (1) the merging fields of neurogenetics and the law, (2) sentencing decisions in cases involving defendants with mental illnesses, and (3) implicit bias against mental illness, no article has connected the literature to provide an interdisciplinary account of these processes. This note argues that the use of neurogenetic evidence in the courtroom may harm defendants with mental illnesses because the nature of the evidence primes negative implicit biases against mental illness. This note then explores how this dynamic plays out during the sentencing phase in capital cases involving defendants with mental illnesses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,NA;Bias (Epidemiology);Neurosciences,,

Methods: a sample of forensic psychiatric patients (n = 57) was asked to complete several self-report instruments (measuring symptom exaggeration, lack of remorse, blame externalization, and offense minimization) and a semi-structured interview about their most recent offense. To quantify patients’ deceitfulness, the information collected via the semi-structured interview was checked against the official records of patient's offenses. Additionally, patient's mental disorders and the extent to which patients denied their delinquency were determined by gathering clinician's judgement on this matter from patient records. The relation between symptom exaggeration and the potential predictors of symptom exaggeration was examined through correlational analyses and cross-tabulation of prevalence rates of symptom exaggeration with prevalence rates of the potential predictors. Results: antisocial personality disorder was not a useful predicator of symptom exaggeration. Also, patients who showed little regret for their offenses, or tended to blame their offenses on external factors, or minimized their delinquency, or were inaccurate when reporting their delinquency, had similar levels of symptom exaggeration as those without these tendencies. Conclusions: neither aspd nor antisocial traits, including lack of remorse, blame externalization, and deceitfulness, were meaningfully related to symptom exaggeration and therefore should have no place in the assessment of symptom validity or the detection of malingering. On the contrary; focusing on antisocial traits as indicators of symptom exaggeration is likely to result in large portions of misclassifications.

The presence of these symptoms has a direct impact on the course and the recovery from the cvds. A less analyzed aspect is the role played by the stress induced by the onset of cvds conditions and, especially, by acute myocardial infarction (ami). In this study, we assessed posttraumatic stress symptoms (ptss), emotional state, health habits, and subjective perception of the event and causal attributions regarding the infarct, in a sample of 76 patients who had suffered an ami in the previous 48-72 hours. Structural equation analyses and path analyses showed that the severity of ptss was predicted by the perceived severity of the ami and by two specific beliefs (i.e., considering that the ami is a hereditary condition and that the help of others will not be beneficial). The results suggest the possibility of early identification of patients with a higher risk of su-ffering a high level of stress derived from the ami. Based on this evidence, we discuss the possibilities of making effective interventions to reduce these symptoms, often ignored in clinical practice, and improve the medical and psychological prognosis of people with ami.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION;COPING;STRESS;CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS;;POSTTRAUMATIC SYMPTOMS;COGNITION;Myocardial Infarction,,

Method: a cross-sectional study was conducted with 159 pregnant women aged 18-44 attending gestational diabetes clinics. Participants completed a questionnaire, which included the edinburgh depression scale (eds), kessler 10-item psychological distress scale (k-10), brief illness perception questionnaire (bipq), and psychiatric/general health items. Multiple regression was used to explore the relationship between eds (total and anxiety subscale) scores and bipq scores, as well as between k-10 (total and anxiety subscale) scores and bipq scores. Results: regression analysis revealed a positive association between eds total/anxiety subscale scores and bipq total score, as well as between k-10 total/anxiety subscale scores and bipq total score, controlling for potentially confounding variables. There was a strong positive correlation between eds total score and k-10 total score. The most frequently expressed concern about gdm was an adverse effect on their baby's health.

We then selectively review the extensive empirical literature on the role of personality traits in depression in adults and children. Current evidence suggests that depression is linked to traits such as neuroticism/negative emotionality, extraversion/positive emotionality, and conscientiousness. Moreover, personality characteristics appear to contribute to the onset and course of depression through a variety of pathways.

This paper investigates the impacts of covid-19 vaccination on fear and economic anxiety using a worldwide sample of 194 countries observed from december 1st, 2020 to march 4th, 2021. The difference-in-differences investigation approach shows that with the vaccine's arrival, the google search trends measuring fear and anxiety are increasing. The arrival of the vaccine has created a general feeling of fear, and people have a lack of confidence in the vaccine's efficiency to overcome the covid-19 crisis. Specifically, anxiety increased when the delta variant was discovered in india. Governments' interventions must ensure that the covid-19 vaccine does not have adverse side effects that can harm public health. We suggested that policy makers should focus on increasing the number of older adults willing to receive the vaccine.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of these complaints in a uk community setting and to establish whether psychosocial risk factors, or `yellow flags', moderate their impact on daily life and work. Methods 580 women and 420 men participated in a cross-sectional survey in the uk in 2007. 467 (57.2\%) of the 816 working age adults in this sample reported complaints over the last month and were included in the moderator multivariate analysis. Results women and the not employed group reported a higher number and greater extent (frequency x severity) of complaints. Statistically significant models emerged for interference with daily life (f (9,457) = 36.54, p < 0.001, adjusted r (2) = 0.407) and time off work (f (4,462) = 31.22, p < 0.001, adjusted r (2) = 0.213). Age (beta = .238) and socio-economic status (beta = -.216) were associated with time off work. Extent of complaints and number of yellow flags were independently associated with interference with daily life (extent beta = .25, yellow flags beta = .15) and time off work (extent beta = .154, yellow flags beta = .201). No moderating effect of yellow flags was found. Conclusions common health problems and yellow flags can be briefly and simply assessed. A broader approach is needed in managing these complaints in community and work contexts, moving beyond reducing complaint severity.

Increasing leisure time physical exercise is a major target of public health programs throughout the developed world, but few international comparisons of exercise habits among people from diverse cultures have been published, the objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of exercise among young adults from 21 european countries, to analyze associations with health beliefs and risk awareness, and to investigate relationships among exercise, other health-related behaviors, and emotional well-being. Methods. The european health and behaviour survey, a questionnaire survey of 7,302 male and 9,181 female university students ages 18-30 years from 21 countries, was analyzed. Results. Age-adjusted prevalence of physical exercise in the past 2 weeks averaged 73.2\% among men and 68.3\% among women, but varied markedly from more than 80\% to less than 60\% across country samples. Beliefs in the health benefits of exercise were consistently associated with physical exercise, as was desire to lose weight. Awareness of the influence of exercise on heart disease averaged 52\% among men and 54\% among women, but was not strongly associated with engagement in exercise. Associations among exercise, lack of smoking, and sleep time were ob served, but results for alcohol consumption were inconsistent. Social support and depression were independently associated with physical exercise, conclusions. Physical exercise levels are highly variable across samples of relatively privileged young europeans from different countries. Associations with other health behaviors and with emotional well-being suggest that regular physical exercise is consistent with a healthy lifestyle. Links with health beliefs are consistent despite sociocultural differences, but deficient knowledge of the health consequences of a sedentary lifestyle remains a cause for concern.

Chi-square and analysis of covariance (ancova) were used to compare age and gender of the samples. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to confirm the structure and fit of the hypothesized model based on data from a previous study that identified four factors: socializing with people with mental illness (socializing), belief that people with mental illness should have normal roles in society (normalizing), non-belief in supernatural causes (witchcraft or curses), and belief in bio-psycho-social causes of mental illness (bio-psycho-social). Analysis of covariance was used to compare four factor scores across countries adjusting for differences in age and gender. Scores on all four factors were highest among u.s. Professionals. The chinese sample showed lowest score on socializing and normalizing while the nigerian and ghanaian samples were lowest on non-belief in supernatural causes of mental illness.

The learners were adults registered in a full-time intermediate esl program in canada. Two oral communication tasks were administered at pre-test, post-test, delayed post-test, and follow-up administrations over 15 weeks to three groups: a comparison group, a communication strategy instruction group, and an affective strategy instruction group. The dissertation consists of four papers, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of the study. The first paper outlines challenges that arose during the research project. I discuss the contextual limitations imposed by intact classes, as well as complexities involved in teacher and student participation, data collection, choice of tasks, data analysis, and ethical considerations. Research manuals are examined to determine the attention directed to the second language acquisition research issues confronted in this study. Finally, additional sources of support are proposed to strengthen second language classroom-based research by novice researchers and classroom teachers. The second paper reports results from the communication strategy (paraphrase) training study. Participants in the comparison and treatment groups performed two oral communication tasks on four occasions. Data from these tasks were used to investigate the effects of strategy training on learners' use of communication strategies, communicative effectiveness, and self-efficacy. Findings showed a direct effect of instruction on the range of communication strategies employed in the tasks. The third paper reports the effects of affective strategy instruction (e.g., anxiety reduction, positive self-talk) on learners' second language productions (narrative descriptions and object descriptions) and their perceptions of self-efficacy. The affective nature of the esl classroom environment is seen as the determining factor in decisions to implement affective strategy instruction. The fourth paper reports the results of self-assessment questionnaires completed by all participants at each task administration. Learners responded to questions regarding their perceptions of self-efficacy; causal attribution; and language learning attitudes and motivation. The chapter includes an examination of the limitations of self-report instruments administered to learners from mixed language backgrounds.

The instruments used were an ad hoc questionnaire, the spanish version of the perceived motivational climate in sport questionnaire (pmcsq-2), the beck anxiety inventory (bai) and the self-concept form-5. The results show that the male sex orients sport motivation towards climate, obtaining higher levels of anxiety, however, the female sex, anxiety has a negative impact on the development of social self-concept. In conclusion, it can be affirmed that gender is a fundamental factor in the orientation of sport practice, as well as the development of anxiety and physical and social self-concept.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,MOTIVATION;ANXIETY;SOCIAL SELF-CONCEPT;PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT;GENDER;Anxiety;Sports,,
rayyan-984748978,An Examination Of Age Effects On The Attributions Made By Parents Of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Children,1996,1,1,NA,,,,,DIXON MJ,,,,,"This study was designed to assess causal attributions made by parents for their attention deficit hyperactivity-disorder (adhd) child's behavior when children are different ages. Two sets of parental beliefs were examined. The first involved parents' beliefs about causes and intentionality of their child's misbehavior. The second focus of this study was on parents' beliefs about themselves and their ability to control their child's negative acts. The rationale for examining parent cognitions was based on the premise that there is a relationship between parent cognitions and parenting behavior and that parenting behavior is an important focus of treatment for adhd. Subjects for this study were 165 mothers of 165 five to thirteen year old adhd boys. Mothers rated their child's behavior on measures of attribution, expectation, and hope. Findings were analyzed by hierarchical regression with severity entered at step 1, age at step 2 and the interaction of age and severity at step 3. It was predicted that mothers of older and more severely symptomatic adhd children would see their child's misbehavior as being more intentional, more infernal to the child, and reflective of a stable pattern that is pervasive than would mothers of younger less severe adhd children. It was further predicted that mothers of older or more severe adhd children would evidence a more general depressive attributional style, would have less hope for their child's future, and would have reduced expectancies for their efficacy as parents. Results indicate no main effects for age or the interaction of age and severity. Limited evidence for a main effect of severity on the compliant-parent effort subscale of the interaction scale and the expectation questionnaire are reported. Limited evidence indicates that mothers of severely symptomatic adhd children expected compliance less frequently but believed that compliance increased with parental effort.

Prevalence estimates vary from 19.1/1000 for serious id to 65/1000 for mild id. Methods: we surveyed carers of persons with id (n = 100) using quantitative and qualitative instruments. We conducted in-depth interviews of carers (n = 16) and key primary health providers (n = 10). We also carried out focus groups (n = 7). Data were triangulated and interpreted in light of peer reviewed literature. Results: there was a delay of 2.92 (95% ci 1.9 to 3.94) to 4.17 (95% ci 2.34 to 6.01) years between detection and seeking of care. Parental stress associated with caring for these children was high (mean self-reporting questionnaire score 8.4; 95% ci 6.80 to 9.91). Home management consisted mainly of physical containment. Stigma associated with id contributed to decreased opportunity for these children and families to participate in community activities. There was a lack of knowledge about causation and effective interventions for id. Conclusions: our findings suggest that there is significant delay in detection of id especially in rural setting where more than 70% of population of pakistan resides. This missed opportunity for rehabilitation in early formative years is a cause of significant distress for the caregivers who rarely receive valid information about course, prognosis and what remedial action to take. There is a need to develop feasible, cost-effective, community level interventions, which can be integrated into existing healthcare systems.

School can be particularly challenging for children with adhd. Few reviews have considered non-pharmacological interventions in school settings. Objectives: to assess the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions delivered in school settings for pupils with, or at risk of, adhd and to explore the factors that may enhance, or limit, their delivery. Data sources: twenty electronic databases (including psycinfo, medline, embase, education resources information centre, the cochrane library and education research complete) were searched from 1980 to february-august 2013. Three separate searches were conducted for four systematic reviews; they were supplemented with forward and backwards citation chasing, website searching, author recommendations and hand-searches of key journals. Review methods: the systematic reviews focused on (1) the effectiveness of school-based interventions for children with or at risk of adhd; (2) quantitative research that explores attitudes towards school-based non-pharmacological interventions for pupils with adhd; (3) qualitative research investigating the attitudes and experiences of children, teachers, parents and others using adhd interventions in school settings; and (4) qualitative research exploring the experience of adhd in school among pupils, their parents and teachers more generally. Methods of synthesis included a random-effects meta-analysis, meta-regression and narrative synthesis for review 1, narrative synthesis for review 2 and meta-ethnography and thematic analysis for reviews 3 and 4. Results: for review 1, 54 controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. For the 36 meta-analysed randomised controlled trials, beneficial effects (p < 0.05) were observed for several symptom and scholastic outcomes. Mean weighted effect sizes ranged from very small (d(+) < 0.20) to large (d(+) >= 0.80), but substantial heterogeneity in effect size estimates across studies was reported. Moderator analyses were not able to clarify which intervention features were linked with effectiveness. For review 2, 28 included studies revealed that educators' attitudes towards interventions ranged in positivity. Most interventions were rated positively or neutrally across different studies. The only intervention that consistently recorded positive attitudes from educators was daily report cards. For review 3, 33 studies met the inclusion criteria. Key findings included tensions regarding the preferred format of interventions, particularly how structured interventions were and the extent to which they are tailored to the child with adhd. There were mixed views about the impact of interventions, although it was clear that interventions both influence and are influenced by the relationships held by children with adhd and participants' attitudes towards school and adhd. For review 4, 34 studies met the inclusion criteria. Key findings included the importance of causal attributions that teachers, parents and pupils made about adhd symptoms, the decisions teachers made about treatment, the self-perceptions pupils developed about themselves, the role of the classroom environment and stigma in aggravating adhd symptoms, and the significant barrier to treatment posed by the common presence of conflict in relationships between pupils-teachers, parents-teachers and pupils-peers in relation to adhd. An overarching synthesis of the four reviews highlighted the importance of the context affecting interventions. It suggested that adhd psychoeducation and relationship-building skills are potential implications for interventions. Limitations: the breadth of both interventions and outcomes in the reviewed studies presented a challenge for categorisation, analysis and interpretation in reviews 1-3. Across reviews, relatively few studies were conducted in the uk, limiting the applicability of findings to uk education. In reviews 1 and 2, the poor methodological quality of some included studies was identified as a barrier to establishing effectiveness or comparing attitudes. In review 3 the descriptive analysis used by the majority of studies constrained theorising during synthesis. Studies in review 4 lacked detail regarding important issues like gender, pupil maturity and school level. Conclusion: findings suggest some beneficial effects of non-pharmacological interventions for adhd used in school settings, but substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes was seen across studies. The qualitative reviews demonstrate the importance of the context in which interventions are used. Future work should consider more rigorous evaluation of interventions, as well as focus on what works, for whom and in which contexts. Gaps in current research present opportunities for the development and testing of standardised tools to describe interventions, agreement on gold-standard outcome measures assessing adhd behaviour and testing a range of potential moderators alongside intervention trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

This study was concerned with the causal attributions made by parents whose children were on psychotropic medication. Twenty-six parents whose children were being treated with methylphenidate for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder participated in a six-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The parents completed the family assessment device, the conner's parent rating scale, and the parent attribution scale-revised. In addition, sociodemographic data were collected on the parents and their children. Four hypotheses regarding the relationships between parents' attributions and their children's behavior, age, severity of hyperactivity, and family functioning were tested. Repeated-measures anova, paired t-tests and manova were used to test these relationships. Results showed that parents' attributions were associated with their children's positive and negative behavior as well as the severity of their children's hyperactivity but not their children's age or family functioning. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed as well as the importance of psychopharmacological knowledge for effective social work practice.

Associations were assessed between causal attributions of schizophrenia and sociodemographic characteristics and exposure/familiarity variables. Certain sociodemographic variables, as well as key exposure/familiarity variables, predicted the nature of one's causal beliefs. The most common causal opinions reported included substance abuse, negative life events, and ``mental illness.'' Findings from a subsample administered an exploratory multiple-choice question investigating understanding of causation revealed that the public may not fully understand the nature of causation.

Hab has been connected to personality types involving hostile beliefs and reactive aggression, including narcissism and psychopathy. Specifically, secondary psychopathy is associated with hab and reactive aggression. Despite research and theory connecting these constructs, few studies have examined if hab mediates the relationships among psychopathy, narcissism, and aggression. The current study explores this possible mediation in an urban college sample. Narcissism was associated with aggression but not hostile aggression or hab. Reactive aggression and hab were both associated with psychopathy, but there were no mediation relationships. The associations with aggression may be, therefore, due to underlying traits of secondary psychopathy rather than the hostile attributions to which the traits contribute; consequently, treatments focused on reducing aggressive responses by correcting interpretations of social situations may not be successful.

The dissertation addresses this gap in the literature by examining three cognitive processes (illness perceptions, attitudes toward depression care, and subjective norms) and their impact on hispanic immigrants' intentions to seek informal and formal sources of care. A conceptual model that draws from the theory of reasoned action and the self-regulatory model of illness cognitions guides this study. A convenience sample of 95 hispanic immigrant patients, 18 years of age or older, attending a primary health care clinic in st. Louis, missouri was recruited. Structured face-to-face interviews that included the presentation of a vignette depicting an individual meeting dsm-iv criteria for major depression were conducted. Results indicate that fifty-five percent of patients described the situation in the vignette as depression. The most prevalent causes attributed to the vignette were interpersonal problems, mostly family conflicts, economic strains and lack of emotional support systems. Depression was perceived by most patients to be a serious and short lasting condition that was amendable to treatment and personal control. Patients endorsed positive attitudes toward their health care provider's skills, the effectiveness of depression treatments, and the role of faith in helping people cope with depression. However, few felt that they had access to depression treatments. Patients also reported that their spouse/partner and family members exerted more influence on their professional help-seeking behaviors than their friends. Results from multivariate regression models indicate that patients' perceptions of depression, attitudes toward depression care, and subjective norms were influenced by cultural values and norms, acculturation, attendance at church or religious services, and demographic factors. Hierarchical multiple regression models revealed that attitudes toward depression care and subjective norms were uniquely associated with intentions to seek informal and formal sources of care after adjusting for psychosocial correlates of service use. These results have implications for improving depression treatments for hispanic immigrants. Areas of future research that build upon the findings of this dissertation are discussed.

Methods: 178 patients were asked during the index hospitalization and 2–2.5 years after discharge whether they thought each of 13 possible factors may have contributed to their illness. Two dichotomous variables, conventional attribution (attribution to traditional risk factors, ca) and psychosocial attribution (pa), were defined and assessed for each patient. Results: general stress, cigarette smoking, and heredity were the most commonly mentioned attribution for the ami. The proportion of individuals with positive ca increased at follow up. There was little congruence between patients’ attributions and actual self-reported risk factors, either at baseline or at follow up. Age, education, country of birth, and anxiety were found as independent predictors of illness attribution. The participation in a cardiac prevention and rehabilitation program (cprp) did not contribute to a significant change in ca attributions. Conclusion: substantial proportions of patients have a poor understanding of the causes of their ami both at onset of the illness and 2–2.5 years later, notwithstanding cprp.

This study aimed to examine: (1) population attitudes toward depression and toward seeking professional help in four european countries; (2) the relation between depression stigma and attitudes toward help-seeking; (3) the relation between both attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics; and (4) differences in attitudes across countries. Methods: a representative general population survey (n=4011) was conducted in germany, hungary, ireland, and portugal, assessing attitudes toward depression and toward help-seeking, and a number of socio-demographic variables. Results: respondents showed a moderate degree of personal stigma toward depression and a strikingly higher degree of perceived stigma. Although a substantial majority showed openness to seek professional help, only half of the people perceived professional help as valuable. More negative attitudes were found in hungary and were associated with male gender, older age, lower educational level and living alone. Also, personal stigma was related to less openness to and less perceived value of professional treatment. Limitations: the survey was cross-sectional, so no causal inferences could be drawn. Conclusions: personal and perceived stigma toward depression deserves public health attention, since they impact upon the intention of people with depression to seek professional help. Public media campaigns should focus on the credibility of the mental health care sector, and target males, older people, and those with a lower educational level and living alone. The content of each campaign should be adapted to the cultural norms of the country for which it is intended. (C) 2013 elsevier b.v.

High and low self-handicappers were assigned to one of three performance feedback conditions: noncontingent failure, success and noncontingent success. High and low self-handicappers were then given an opportunity to claim handicaps prior to completing measures of attributions and state anxiety. Following noncontingent success, high self-handicappers reported greater anxiety, more unproductive attributions and claimed more handicaps than low self-handicappers. However no differences were evident for high and low self-handicappers following either noncontingent failure or success.

Data were collected from four cases that were bound by the experience of mental illness. Within each case, the individual experiencing illness (omunanamwengu), family members, and bothomunanamwenguand family members were interviewed formally (via a semi-structured interview protocol) or informally due to participants' preferences for not being recorded. Using stake's suggested approach to multiple-case study cross-case analysis, each individual case is described and cross-case themes (development and symptoms of mental illness; marginalization andomunanamwengu; family roles in the lives of the distressed andeemwengu; belief in treatment) were identified. Findings are discussed in light of the role of beliefs in treatment as well as family involvement, the potential influence of discrimination on mental illness, and implications for practice and cross-cultural psychology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,OMUNANAMWENGU;EEMWENGU;NAMIBIA;AAWAMBO;EXPLANATORY MODELS OF ILLNESS,,

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is a condition that affects millions of children and often persists into adulthood. Adhd can include a combination of problems, such as difficulty sustaining attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour. The frequent co-morbidity of dyslexia and adhd posed the question of the issue whether common causal mechanism can be identified. There are several causal explanation of the co-morbidity between dyslexia and adhd. Firstly, the symptoms of adhd associated with dyslexia are a secondary consequence of reading problems ('phenocopy' hypothesis). However, the finding could not substantiate in later studies. Therefore, the first aim the present research is to identify the frequency and nature of co-morbidity between dyslexics and adhd children. Developmental dyslexia and adhd are some of the most complex developmental disorders that affect children population. These are some of the conditions which affect the ability of the children to benefit from education and engage with surroundings in a meaningful manner. These conditions may occur in isolation, but many times they overlap. These overlapping conditions are termed as co-morbidity, and this may reflect the greater difficulties experienced by the children with a combination of deficits. However, the underlying reasons for these and the subsequent behavioural deficits are not well understood. Thus, the second major goal of the article is to investigate neuro-cognitive underpinning of dyslexia and adhd. Neuro-cognitive basis presented by prefrontal dorsolateral cortex dysfunction was revealed and executive functions presented by problems in phonological working memory, initiating the activity and multitasking were established.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ADHD;DYSLEXIA;COMORBIDITY;NEURO-COGNITION;READING;EXECUTIVE;FUNCTIONS;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Dyslexia;Cognition,,

The current study analysed additional data to establish whether; 1) cognitive, behavioural and emotional factors hypothesized to perpetuate ibs symptoms and disability changed following cbt and, 2) ascertain if changes in these factors over the intervention period mediated treatment effects 6-months later. Method: ibs patients (cbt = 31, tau = 33) completed measures pre-and-post intervention including: brief illness perception questionnaire, hospital anxiety & depression scale and cognitive and behavioural responses to symptoms questionnaire. Path models were evaluated to determine whether changes in cognitive and behavioural factors over the treatment period mediated treatment effects. Results: compared to tau, cbt patients showed significant positive changes on several cognitive variables but not anxiety and depression following intervention. Positive change in illness perceptions following intervention mediated the treatment effect on improved ibs symptom severity and social adjustment six months later. Changes in damaging beliefs mediated the effect on social adjustment. Conclusions: change in cognition rather than mood mediated treatment related improvements. Changing negative perceptions of ibs appears to be a particularly important treatment mechanism.

Aims to investigate the impact of individual-level (illness representations of covid-19) and structurally derived (anticipated social-political development in the economy, security, and social harmony in the next year) factors, and their potential moderation effects on depressive symptoms. Methods an anonymous population-based telephone survey was conducted among the general public of hong kong, china during 3-10 april 2020 (n = 300, response rate 56\%). Depressive symptoms were assessed by the validated chinese version of the patient health questionnaire-9. Results of the participants, 8.7\% showed probable moderate-to-severe depression. Hierarchical linear regression models showed that illness representations of personal/treatment control and emotional responses and anticipated deterioration in social harmony were independently and significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Anticipated deterioration in security significantly moderated the associations between perceived consequence/treatment control of covid-19 and depressive symptoms, such that the associations were stronger among people who anticipated a strong deterioration in security. Conclusions the findings suggested that perceptions of covid-19 and future social-political development jointly and interactively contributed to depressive symptoms during the covid-19 pandemic.

Moderation and mediation explanatory models of the sex difference in likelihood of depression were examined. Findings indicate that the factors associated with depression in adolescent boys and girls are quite similar. All of the variables considered were associated with depression, but sex did not moderate the impact of vulnerability factors on likelihood of depression diagnosis. However, negative self-perceptions in the domains of achievement, global self-worth, and physical appearance partially mediated the relationship between sex and depression. Further, girls had higher levels of positive self-perceptions in interpersonal domains that acted as suppressors and reduced the likelihood of depression in girls. These findings suggest that girls' higher incidence of depression is due in part to their higher levels of negative self-perceptions, whereas positive interpersonal factors serve to protect them from depressive episodes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ADOLESCENCE;DEPRESSION;SEX DIFFERENCES;VULNERABILITY FACTORS;;PROTECTIVE FACTORS;Sex Characteristics;Adolescent,,

In these individuals the basic structural components of language may be intact, but the ability to use language to engage socially is impaired. Despite the nature of these difficulties being well documented, exactly what causes these difficulties is less clear. Furthermore, the current status of causal explanations for pragmatic difficulties across these populations is divergent and sometimes contradictory. This paper explores the empirical validity of three theories that attempt to explain pragmatic language impairment.

A patient was more likely to report a causal attribution of the injury to alcohol the higher the weekly intake and the higher the frequency of heavy episodic drinking. The motivation to change variables showed a similar pattern of increased likelihood of attributing a causal link of alcohol and injury with increasing discontent with drinking behaviours and increasing desire to change drinking behaviours.

Aim: the aim of this study was to deepen the knowledge of how attitudes toward people with mental illness are affected by specific personal beliefs and characteristics, such as culture and religion of the perceiver. More precisely, the main purpose is the definition of a structure of variables, namely perceived dangerousness, social closeness, and avoidance of the ill person, together with the beliefs about the best treatment to be undertaken and the sick person' gender, capable of describing the complexity of the stigma construct in particular as far as schizophrenia is concerned. Method: the study involved 305 university students, 183 from the university of padua, italy, and 122 from the university of haifa, israel. For the analyses, a latent class analysis (lca) approach was chosen to identify a latent categorical structure accounting for the covariance between the observed variables. Such a latent structure was expected to be moderated by cultural background (italy versus israel) and religious beliefs, whereas causal beliefs, recommended treatment, dangerousness, social closeness, and public avoidance were the manifest variables, namely the observed indicators of the latent variable. Results: two sets of results were obtained. First, the relevance of the manifest variables as indicators of the hypothesized latent variable was highlighted. Second, a two-latentclass categorical dimension represented by prejudicial attitudes, causal beliefs, and treatments concerning schizophrenia was found. Specifically, the differential effects of the two cultures and the religious beliefs on the latent structure and their relations highlighted the relevance of the observed variables as indicators of the expected latent variable. Conclusion: the present study contributes to the improvement of the understanding of how attitudes toward people with mental illness are affected by specific personal beliefs and characteristics of the perceiver. The definition of a structure of variables capable of describing the complexity of the stigma construct in particular as far as schizophrenia is concerned was achieved from a cross-cultural perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,CROSS-CULTURES;SCHIZOPHRENIA;CAUSAL BELIEFS;DANGEROUSNESS;CLOSENESS;;AVOIDANCE;TREATMENT;LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS;Schizophrenia,,

Locus of control was measured using the zelen-o'reilly locus of control scale (zorloc). Attributional style was measured using the attributional style questionnaire (asq). Subjects included 45 panic disorder patients with and without agoraphobic avoidance, who participated in an outpatient medication study at the university of southern california's anxiety disorders clinic during the years 1988-1990. Data for these patients was archival, and was used with permission from dennis j. Munjack, m.d. Normal control subjects consisted of 45 volunteers who were employees and/or family members working at several school districts in los angeles county. The two groups were matched for gender, with each group containing 31 females and 14 males. Subjects were also equated for age (within five years). Contrary to what was predicted, panic patients were found to have an internal locus of control that was equal to that of the normal control group. As predicted, a trend was found for panic disorder patients to score higher than normal control subjects on the powerful others-manipulative self (pom) subscale of the zorloc. When success and failure dimensions were looked at separately, panic disorder patients scored significantly higher on the success dimension of the pom subscale. These differences suggest that panic disorder patients are more dependent and may engage in manipulative behavior in some everyday situations, particularly in situations where they expect a successful outcome. In addition, exploratory analysis revealed that panic disorder patients scored significantly higher on the powerful others-passive self (pop) subscale for failure situations, when compared to a normal control group.

This qualitative study explores gender-specific experiences of smi and the extent to which sociocultural factors may explain the observed difference in prevalence estimates. Using purposive sampling, 39 in-depth interviews were conducted with community members from butajira, a rural district in south central ethiopia. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis to elicit community perspectives on cultural explanatory models of smi and experiences in this region. Gender-specific experiences were reported to differ due to visibility of symptoms, community responses, and varying levels of family support towards individuals with smi. Overall, respondents described how various sociocultural factors subject women with smi to higher levels of physical and social isolation compared to men, greatly affecting community health workers’ ability to identify and provide care to women with mental illness. Future case detection methods should involve family members as they interact with women with smi early on in the development of their symptoms and play an essential role in their path to mental health care.

Fifty-nine cfs patients of each clinic, located in leuven and brussels (belgium), participated. Patients did not differ with regard to age, levels of fatigue, psychopathology, and self-efficacy. However, patients from the psychosocially-oriented clinic had a lower level of education, reported more progressive illness onset, and attributed their illness more to psychological causes. Patients in the biologically- oriented clinic reported more pain, and showed higher levels of social functioning, motivation and vitality, as well as fewer limitations related to emotional problems. It is concluded that cfs patients attending the 2 clinics could not be distinguished along dualistic biological/psychosocial lines, but those reporting sudden illness onset and making somatic attributions were more likely to be represented in the biologically-oriented clinic.

Using a novel combination of experimental methodologies, we observed that participants primed with randomness-related words exhibited heightened beliefs in spiritual control compared with participants primed with negatively valenced control words.

There are relatively few published surveys of perinatal mental health literacy. Aims: to provide a profile of current awareness, knowledge and attitudes in relation to the mental health of women and men in the perinatal period. Method: a cross-sectional online survey (n = 1,201) of adults (> 18 years) in each state and territory of australia was conducted in early 2016. Survey questions were based on a previous 2009 survey, with the addition of several novel items designed to assess knowledge around both perinatal anxiety and men's perinatal mental health. Results: depression (including postnatal depression) was the most frequently cited general health problem for women in the first postnatal year (52\% of spontaneous first responses). Over 70\% of adults believed that postnatal depression requires specialised treatment and checks for depressive symptoms should occur routinely in pregnancy and the first postnatal year. Women identified postnatal depression at a higher rate than men. Most commonly, postnatal depression was perceived as having a biological rather than psychosocial etiology (34.5\%). Men and women differed in their knowledge about the symptoms of postnatal depression with more women correctly identifying core depressive symptoms. The specific term `perinatal depression' was not well recognised. Although not well recognised as a general health issue, when prompted, 39\% of respondents were aware of anxiety as a specific perinatal mental health issue. Most adult australians (60\%) were unaware that perinatal depression and anxiety could be experienced by men. Conclusion: awareness of postnatal depression appeared high. However, areas including anxiety, antenatal mental health, and men's mental health were less well-understood. There remains considerable scope, and a need for, continued awareness-raising around anxiety, mental health in pregnancy and men's mental health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,PERINATAL ANXIETY;PERINATAL DEPRESSION;MEN'S MENTAL HEALTH;MENTAL;HEALTH LITERACY;POSTNATAL DEPRESSION;Australia;Anxiety,,

Explanatory models of hfa have emphasized observational learning, parental cardiac disease, and the effects of separation experiences as key ethological factors. The purpose of this study was: (a) to provide descriptive information on the prevalence of hfa in an unselect sample of younger adults; and (b) to investigate the relation of hfa and general illness fears to parental medical history and different types of separation experiences. 421 undergraduate students completed the cardiac anxiety questionnaire (caq), illness attitude scales, parental medical history questionnaire, and separation anxiety and experiences questionnaire. Approximately 2-3\% of our sample reported excessive hfa, and both illness attitudes and parental cardiac disease predicted 23\% of total caq variance. Subjects with high caq scores reported more parental cardiac and other medical problems than low hfa subjects. Although high and low hfa subjects did not differ in terms of number of personal intimate relationships that ended in separation, subjects with separated parents reported more hfa than persons with nonseparated parents. We discuss the relevance of these findings for our understanding of hfa. Copyright (c) 1996 elsevier science ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Aim: our objective was to generate hypotheses regarding antidepressant use among older primary care patients. Methods: we utilized a mixed methods design that is both hypothesis-testing and hypothesis-generating. Adults aged 65 years and over were recruited from primary care practices and interviewed in their homes. We examined the personal characteristics of older adults according to antidepressant use (hypothesis-testing). Participants taking antidepressants and participants not taking antidepressants were asked open-ended questions about their views on treatment for depression. Themes related to use of antidepressants were examined (hypothesis-generating). Results: older adults taking antidepressants were more likely to be white and have more depression symptoms compared to older adults not taking antidepressants (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). Positive and negative themes emerged when participants discussed antidepressant use. We linked quantitative data from the participants with the themes they endorsed to form an emerging theory about older adults' perceptions about antidepressant use. Conclusion: few personal characteristics were associated with antidepressant use. An improved understanding of how older adults view antidepressant use, derived from multiple methods, may inform clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,DEPRESSION;AGED;PRIMARY HEALTH CARE;ANTIDEPRESSANTS;ADHERENCE;Antidepressive Agents;Primary Health Care,,

However, the biophobic component has largely been ignored, despite, given its adaptive functional role, being an essential part of the construct. If there is a phylogenetic component underlying nature connectedness, biophilic, and/or biophobic, there should be evidence of this record from early childhood. The main aim of this study is therefore to describe the emotional attributions identified in 5 years old. Methodology: two studies were conducted. In the first, 94 children expressed their concept of nature and made basic emotional attributions to a set of 30 images of natural, using a software designed for the study. In the second, 39 children repeated the procedure and provided explanations for their responses. Results: the main results show that, in general, children use both positive and negative emotions, which may be related to a three-dimensional model of emotional attributions to nature. The most widely attributed emotion is happiness. However, fear is the second most common attribution. The role of happiness could be explained by a feeling of security and familiarity, while the importance of fear in nature could show an adaptive response of the fear of wild nature in children. This interpretation could be confirmed when analyzing specifically the emotional attributions, classifying the images according to biological and ecosystemic criteria. Thus, for example, more emotional attributions are explained by the 'pleasantness' attributed to primary producers and landscapes (e.g., flora), versus attributions of 'harm' to the images of secondary and tertiary consumers (e.g., hunters). Conclusion: these results provide evidence in favor of a didactic procedure to study emotional attributions to images of nature in preschool children. They suggest the incorporation of biophobia as an important adaptive factor in connectedness to nature and a tripartite emotional hypothesis based on the valences of the attributed emotions.

The results yielded a 9-factor model of naive attributions about the reasons for stage fright: mistakes, unfamiliar role, humiliation, negative results, rigid rules, personality traits, preparation, audience interest, and physical appearance. Respondents' previous public speaking experience affected their ratings of these factors, but their personal level of public speaking anxiety was unrelated.

Study 3 investigated the effects of attachment dimensions on students' causal attributions as a function of the elapsed time since receiving a disappointing grade. The studies demonstrate the relevance of attachment styles to achievement-related self-efficacy and causal attributions.

Depression was assessed by 2 self-report inventories. Following hypothetical failure at an oral examination, depressed ss reported more attributions than nondepressed ss and attributed their failures more often to global, stable, and internal factors. In addition, depressed ss decreased their expectancies of future success across a wider range of situations than did their nondepressed peers. Presenting ss with a variety of attributional alternatives for their failures remedied the detrimental effect of failure on subsequent expectancies of success. This 'therapeutic effect' was strongest among depressed ss, thus counteracting the usual failure generalization. Findings support recent extensions of the learned helplessness model of depression. Implications for the cognitive treatment of depression are discussed.

The model predicts that people who exhibit a style of attributing negative outcomes to global factors will show helplessness deficits in new situations that are either similar or dissimilar to the original situation in which they were helpless. In contrast, people who exhibit a style of attributing negative outcomes to only specific factors will show helplessness deficits in situations that are similar, but not dissimilar, to the original situation in which they were helpless. To test these predictions, 2 studies were conducted in which undergraduates with either a global or specific attributional style for negative outcomes (as measured by the attributional style questionnaire) were given 1 of 3 pretreatments in the typical helplessness triadic design: controllable bursts of noise, uncontrollable bursts of noise, or no noise. Ss were also administered the beck depression inventory. In exp i, 108 ss were tested for helplessness deficits in a test situation similar to the pretreatment setting, whereas in exp ii, 60 ss were tested in a test situation dissimilar to the pretreatment setting.

The levels of emotional awareness and alexithymia were compared in 11 females and 4 males (mean age 43.9 yrs) with major depression and 11 female and 4 male control ss (mean age 43.2 yrs) in france. The french-language versions of the montgomery-asberg depression rating scale, the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (y.

The results suggest that the depressive ss had a deficit in affective functioning, with particular impairment of the ability to attribute emotions to others.

A fundamental change is needed in the relationship between black and ethnic minorities (bme) and psychiatric service providers if the objectives of the programme are to be realised. Bmes, and in particular people of african descent, are over-represented in secure psychiatric wards and among those in receipt of coercive interventions. An obvious strategy for addressing the problem is to reduce the number of bmes entering secure services and improve the experience of those who are caught up in the services, at the same time as speeding the transition through such services. Once they have been discharged from secure services, interventions to reduce their re-admissions back to such services are needed. Reducing the number of bmes entering the service requires a search for innovative solutions. This might involve redesigning interventions which, although not developed with a focus on bmes, might be relevant. Clinicians and institutions need to understand concepts of illness currently described in the social sciences so that they are not so obsessed with the biomedical model. Incorporation of issues like identity, explanatory models, idioms of distress, spirituality and environmental influences on health will lead to a cultural formulation similar to that advocated in the appendix of the dsm-iv, which has had negligible impact in the uk so far. The individual and community context in which mental health problems arise in bmes needs to be better understood, and cultural competence will facilitate this.

We sought to investigate the relative impact of disease severity and patients' perceptions about their condition on depression, anxiety, and quality of life over a period of a year.; Methods: a total of 110 patients aged over 16 years completed an initial questionnaire containing measures for anxiety, depression, quality of life, and illness perceptions when they attended the adult congenital heart disease clinic. Cardiologists rated the patients' disease severity and illness course. A year later, patients were invited to complete the same measures. Regression analyses were performed to determine the relative impact of illness perceptions and disease severity on psychological outcomes a year later.; Results: at baseline, 23% of the study population had depressive symptoms and 30% had elevated trait anxiety. After controlling for associations with disease-related variables, illness perceptions explained 28% of the variance in depression, 40% anxiety, and 27% overall quality of life at baseline. Baseline illness perceptions bivariately predicted quality of life, cardiac anxiety, and depression 1 year later, and regression analyses controlling for other factors showed that they were significant predictors of outcomes 1 year later.; Conclusion: symptoms of depression and anxiety are common among adults with chd.

It challenges the universality of psychiatric diagnosis and proposes that cultural psychiatry's framing of `culture-bound syndromes,' or `cultural case formulation' guidelines, is oversimplified. Use of the dsm in the south african context risks perpetuating injustice by labelling and stigmatising people who have in the past been racially stigmatised by apartheid.

Experimental studies suggest that anxiety and depression are characterised by distinct future-oriented thinking profiles, and that these profiles are markedly different from those of asymptomatic adults. In this paper, we review these profiles and propose two explanatory models marked by two different neurocognitive systems. The reconstructive memory model emphasises a role for emotionally driven learning and retrieval in episodic foresight (i.e., the construction of future-oriented scenarios), and the valuation model proposes that an overweighing of risk and uncertainty estimates can be invoked to explain the future-oriented thought patterns. We consider the effectiveness of interventions aimed at altering such thought patterns.

Recent findings cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug globally and its use appears to be increasing in developed and developing countries. In developed countries rebelliousness, antisocial behaviour, poor school performance, and affiliation with drug-using peers are risk factors for early and regular cannabis use. Similar antecedents are now being reported in developing countries. Dependence is an underappreciated risk of cannabis that affects one in six to seven adolescents who use cannabis in developed countries. Adolescent cannabis dependence is correlated with an increased risk of using other illicit drugs, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of psychosis. The plausibility of cannabis playing a contributory causal role has increased for symptoms of psychosis in longitudinal studies but remains contentious. In the case of other illicit drug use and mood disorders common causal explanations remain difficult to exclude. Summary early and regular cannabis use in adolescence predicts an increased risk of cannabis dependence which in turn predicts an increased risk of using other illicit drugs, and reporting symptoms of mood and psychotic disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,CANNABIS;DEPENDENCE;PSYCHOSIS;Cannabis;Developing Countries;Developed Countries;Prevalence,,

The article begins by discussing the perceived causes of poverty and their taxonomic properties (locus, stability, and controllability). One antecedent of causal beliefs, political ideology, is then examined in detail, followed by a review of the effects of causal beliefs on emotions and behavior. It is contended that helping the poor is a moral issue, but the moral evaluation concerns the targeted recipient of aid rather than the potential help giver. Persons perceived as responsible for their plight, a dominant construal for conservatives, elicit anger and neglect. In contrast, those seen as not responsible for their financial hardship, an outlook predominantly endorsed by liberals, arouse sympathy and help giving. Sympathy is the most important proximal determinant of aid. This analysis is extended to reactions to achievement failure, abortion, and rape.

The current study aimed to investigate whether these negative attributions are related to trauma-related shame and ptsd symptom severity.; Method: a total of 658 participants aged 18 to 89 (m = 33.42; sd = 12.17) with a history of trauma exposure completed a range of self-report measures assessing trauma exposure, negative trauma-related attributions, shame, and ptsd symptoms.; Results: higher levels of internal, stable, and global trauma-related attributions were significantly associated with shame and ptsd. Shame mediated the association between trauma-related attributions and ptsd symptom severity, even after controlling for the effects of number of trauma exposures, worst index trauma and depression.; Conclusions: the present results suggest that negative attributions are a critical cognitive component related to shame and in turn, ptsd symptom severity.

Method: computerized literature searches were conducted under the keywords tourette syndrome, tics, and children-adolescents. Results: studies have documented the natural history of tourette syndrome and its frequent co-occurrence with attention problems, obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), and a range of other mood and anxiety disorders, which are often of primary concern to patients and their families. Proper diagnosis and education are often very helpful for patients, parents, siblings, teachers, and peers. When necessary, available anti-tic treatments have proven efficacious. First-line options include the alpha adrenergic agents and the atypical neuroleptics, as well as behavioral interventions such as habit reversal. Conclusions: the study of tics and tourette symdrome has led to the development of several pathophysiological models and helped in the development of management options. However, fully explanatory models are still needed that would allow for accurate prognostication in the course of illness and the development of improved treatments.

A major risk factor for violence perpetration is childhood exposure to violence, prompting the proposal that social learning is a major contributor to the transgenerational transmission of violence. Using an animal model devoid of human cultural factors, we showed that male rats became highly aggressive against their female partners as adults after exposure to non-social stressful experiences in their youth. Their offspring also showed increased aggression toward females in the absence of postnatal father-offspring interaction or any other exposure to violence. Both the females that cohabited with the stressed males and those that cohabited with their male offspring showed behavioral (including anxiety- and depression-like behaviors), physiological (decreased body weight and basal corticosterone levels) and neurobiological symptoms (increased activity in dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons in response to an unfamiliar male) resembling the alterations described in abused and depressed women. With the caution required when translating animal work to humans, our findings extend current psychosocial explanations of the transgenerational transmission of intimate partner violence by strongly suggesting an important role for biological factors.

Methods the study included 60 patients with psoriasis (n = 30) and vitiligo (n = 30) as well as healthy persons (n = 60) matched to the experimental group in terms of gender, age, and level of education. Control of negative emotions was examined by means of watson and greer's courtauld emotional control scale (polish adaptation by juczynski) and the illness perception by means of kossakowska's chronic patients questionnaire. Results the research concludes that psoriasis patients control negative emotions more intensively than healthy people. Vitiligo patients on the other hand do not differ in the control of negative emotions compared with healthy subjects. There are no significant predictors of negative emotional control in vitiligo. In psoriasis gender and age are the main contributors to negative emotional control and anger control is predicted by the age at onset as well. Conclusion the specificity of the skin disease affects maladaptive negative emotional control and the suggestion is to use psychological treatment in hospitalised psoriasis in particular.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,EMOTIONAL CONTROL;ILLNESS PERCEPTION;NEGATIVE EMOTIONS;PSORIASIS;;VITILIGO;Psoriasis,,

The present study used the same paradigm to test a prediction derived from d. R. Hemsley (1994); that schizophrenic ss, and, following a dimensional approach (g. S. Claridge, 1987), highly schizotypal controls, will rely more on moment-by-moment perceptions (contiguity) than learned regularity (contingency) in causal processing and that this would be manifested as a reduced influence of contingency compared to contiguity (compared to ss low in schizotypy) on judged necessity ratings. 30 nonpsychiatric ss (mean age 29.13 yrs) grouped as high or low schizotypy according to a median split of scores on the oxford–liverpool inventory of feelings and experiences (o.

The motivational beliefs that adults make for their own memory performances were examined across tests of recall, recognition, face-name learning, and appointment-keeping. Forty-eight older and 48 younger community-living adults were required to report the factors they believed influenced their performance and the memory strategies used for each task. A final questionnaire required subjects to rank order the importance of a list of causal factors. There were significantly more younger adults as compared to older adults who attributed performance to controllable factors (i.e. Strategy use), although age differences in beliefs on a more familiar memory task were smaller than on other tasks. Moreover, within age groups, attributions to controllable factors were associated with increased memory performance compared to when memory was attributed to uncontrollable factors (i.e. Ability, age).

Results: from 54231 entries, 22 studies were analyzed, and 13 were included in the final meta-analysis of kappa agreement using a mixed-effects meta-regression model. A mean kappa of 0.41 (fair agreement, 95\% ci: 0.34 to 0.47) but high heterogeneity (i(2) = 92\%) were calculated. Gender, mean age, nsdi setting (inpatient vs. Outpatient; university vs. Non-university), and sdi informant (self vs. Professional) were tested as predictors in meta-regression. Only sdi informant was relevant for the explanatory model, leaving 79\% unexplained heterogeneity. Egger's test did not indicate significant bias, and quadas-2 resulted in ``average'' data quality. Conclusions: most studies using sdis do not report the original sample size, only the sdi-diagnosed patients. Kappa comparison resulted in high heterogeneity, which may reflect the influence of non-systematic bias in diagnostic processes. Although results were highly heterogeneous, we measured a fair agreement kappa between sdi and nsdi, implying clinicians might operate in scenarios not equivalent to psychiatry trials, where samples are filtered, and there may be more emphasis on maintaining reliability.

Performances were converted to standardized scores and averaged to calculate individual domain scores and a global index of cognitive function. Methods: logistic and hierarchical regressions were completed to separately determine the associations between clinical, demographic, and cognitive variables with regards to frailty status. Results: results of the logistic regressions revealed that lower executive function, female sex, and higher symptoms of depression were associated with frailty. The hierarchical analysis revealed no significant contribution of executive function to frailty status after accounting for female sex and symptoms of depression (nagelkerke r-2 = 0.15).

These effects emerged after controlling for pessimistic explanatory style, depressed mood, and self-esteem. In addition, the association between anxiety and emotional distress was mediated by attributions and attachment-related needs. In study 2, anxious individuals endorsed relationship-threatening attributions for their partner's transgressions but less so for their partner's positive behaviors, and these effects occurred primarily among those in unhappy relationships.

Subjects were selected from approximately 500 7th and 8th grade students at a rural middle school using gate 1 of the walker-severson systematic screening for behavior disorders (ssbd) procedure and the children's depression inventory (cdi). After screening, subjects were randomly assigned to either a cognitive-behavioral group condition or wait-list control group. Upon conclusion of the cognitive-behavioral interventions, subjects in the experimental and control groups were compared on the following dependent measures: the nowicki strickland locus of control scale, the children's attributional style questionnaire, the achenbach child behavior checklist-teacher form, the achenbach youth self-report form and the cdi. Pre-and post-test differences in cdi scores also were examined. In comparison to the control group, it was hypothesized that the experimental groups would have a more internal locus of control, a less depressive attributional style, and less depressive behavior and symptomatology as reported on both forms of the achenbach and the cdi. Significantly lower post-test versus pre-test scores on the cdi also were expected for the experimental group.

This dissertation examines the experience and diagnosis of mental disorders for the tzeltal maya of chiapas, mexico. The methods employed include focused ethnoepidemiology survey, folk medical explanatory model survey, and recruitment of self-identified cases of recognized folk disorders--to provide a study population of cases for the administration of life history interviews, folk explanatory model questionnaire for the history of current condition, and video taping of interviews. The data reported on here reflect the self-diagnosed and reported health status of 1986 living individuals from 306 households in the tzeltal maya municipality of tenejapa. Of those interviewed, approximately 100 individuals reported some illness, with 34 individuals reporting current or previous mental illness: 20 report chawaj, 5 report suffering from jowiel, 7 from tup' tup' ik', and 2 recount suffering from some other mental illness. The 'other' mental illnesses are headaches, sometimes classified as mental illness. Of the 33 individuals suffering from some type of mental illness, 21 females and 12 males comprise the population, or two-thirds women and one-third men.

The sample included 119 participants who completed the children of alcoholics screening test, a demographic questionnaire, the substance abuse subtle screening inventory-2 (sassi-2), an abridged version of the child maltreatment interview schedule - short form, and the interpretive style questionnaire. Based on sassi-2 criteria, there were 55 chemically dependent (cd) participants and 64 non-chemically dependent (noncd) participants. As predicted, childhood sexual abuse (but not physical abuse) was significantly more prevalent in the cd group. Contrary to predictions, there were no significant differences between cd-aoas and noncd-aoas on interpretive style. Interestingly, although noncd-aoas who were sexually abused had significantly less adaptive interpretive styles than did noncd-aoas who were not sexually abused, these findings did not hold true for the cd group. Neither the participant's age at the onset of parental alcoholism nor the length of time the participant lived with an alcoholic parent distinguished the cd and the non-cd groups. An important limitation was that a majority of cd participants were in 12-step recovery programs. Similar studies with cd individuals who are not in recovery or who recently became sober might yield different results regarding interpretive style since it is unclear whether being in recovery influences how people think and feel about their childhood experiences with parental alcoholism. The prevalence of sexual abuse in the cd group suggests that clinicians in the substance abuse field should be properly trained to assess and treat clients who have been sexually abused.

rayyan-984749077,A Biosystemic Model Of Coping In Schizophrenia,2001,1,1,NA,,,,,RIVERA MINDT MG,,,,,"The behavioral effects of environmental stress on individuals with schizophrenia have been well documented in the literature. Such individuals are especially vulnerable to difficulties related to stress and possess limited coping skills to deal with psychosocial stressors. However, relatively little is known regarding the neuropsychological and neuroendocrinological substrates of coping in schizophrenia, and how they relate to the behavioral effects of stress within this population. The present study was designed to investigate the neuroendocrinological, neuropsychological, attributional, and behavioral mechanisms of coping within schizophrenia, and discuss implications for treatment. Study participants included a total of thirty-five individuals with the diagnosis of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder as defined by the dsm-iv, and confirmed by a trained psychiatrist and licensed clinical psychologist. The results of this investigation revealed that hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis dysregulation, (in the form of hypocortisolemia), neuropsychological impairments in executive functioning, and verbal learning and memory; and behavioral functioning all significantly predict coping attributions in schizophrenia. However, the relationship with hpa axis dysregulation and coping was marginal, while robust relationships were observed in the domains of neuropsychological and behavioral functioning with coping attributions. The results of this study generally support a priori hypotheses regarding the multi-systemic nature of coping in schizophrenia. With regard to treatment, it would be expected that pharmacological treatments (i.e., antipsychotics and cortisol regulating drugs) and psychosocial treatments (i.e., stress management and coping skills training) might all serve as useful strategies targeting hpa axis and behavioral dysregulation. Future empirical investigation must be undertaken in order to further elucidate these relationships with a larger sample, as well as systematically examine possible treatments to improve coping skills for stress within this population.

rayyan-984749079,Attributions And Depression: An Examination Of Attributions And Depression Within Abusive Femilies,1998,1,1,NA,,,,,KRESS FJ,,,,,"Research on child abuse has primarily focused on external variables (e.g., duration and frequency of abuse, relationship to perpetrator, family context) that may mediate abused children's psychological adjustment. In addition, studies have typically examined family members' responses to abuse in isolation. The present study examined the relation of internal, attributional factors to level of depression in abused children and their non-offending parents. In addition, intra-familial relationships were assessed to determine whether abused children's level of depression and attributions matched their non-offending parents' level of depression and attributions; whether non-offending parents could accurately assess their abused children's psychological functioning; and whether non-offending parents could disentangle their own responses from their abused children's responses. The results confirm predictions that maladaptive attributions are related to increased depression in both abused children and their non-offending parents. Furthermore, the parents in this study were unable to accurately assess their abused children's emotional state, and they could not disentangle their own level of functioning from their abused children's level of functioning. These results suggest that non-offending parents may have difficulty understanding the needs and adversities of their abused children. These data also underscore the problems confronting families with a child who has experienced abuse.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of parents' adverse childhood experiences, depressive symptoms, and parental stress, on their sensitive response toward their tooddler and quality of traidic interactions. A correlational cross-sectional method was used. The sample included 80 mother-father-child triads, of toddlers with social-emotional difficulties. Parents early adverse experiences, parental stress, and depressive symptoms were assessed through self-report measures. Observational measures on parental sensitivity and triadic interaction were used. For mothers and fathers, adverse childhood experiences were associated with depressive symptoms in adulthood. Sensitivity toward their child and stress were positively associated among both parents. Symptoms of depression in mothers were associated with lower sensitivity toward their child, but in fathers, their sensitive response was influenced by the level of parental stress in the mother. In both parents, greater sensitivity in the dyadic interaction with the child was associated with a higher quality of the triadic interactions, in the triad as a whole, and in the regulation and involvement of the child.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,PARENTAL MENTAL HEALTH;PARENTAL SENSITIVITY;TRIADIC INTERACTION;Infant,,

Individuals aged 40-69 without known diabetes were identified as being at high risk of having undiagnosed type 2 diabetes using patient records and a validated risk score (n = 1,280). 355 individuals were randomised in a 2 to 1 ratio into non-invited (n = 238) and invited (n = 116) groups. A stepwise screening programme confirmed the presence or absence of diabetes. Six weeks after the last contact (either test or invitation), a questionnaire was sent to all participants, including non-attenders and those who were not originally invited. Outcome measures included attendance, anxiety (short-form spielberger state anxiety inventory-stai), self-rated health and diabetes illness perceptions.; Results: 95 people (82% of those invited) attended for the initial capillary blood test. Six individuals were diagnosed with diabetes. Invited participants were more anxious than those not invited (37.6 vs. 34.1 stai, p-value = 0.015), and those diagnosed with diabetes were considerably more anxious than those classified free of diabetes (46.7 vs. 37.0 stai, p-value = 0.031). Non-attenders had a higher mean treatment control sub-scale (3.87 vs. 3.56, p-value = 0.016) and a lower mean emotional representation sub-scale (1.81 vs. 2.68, p-value = 0.001) than attenders. No differences in the other five illness perception sub-scales or self-rated health were found.; Conclusion: screening for type 2 diabetes in primary care is feasible but may be associated with higher levels of short-term anxiety among invited compared with non-invited participants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ANXIETY/*ETIOLOGY;DIABETES MELLITUS;TYPE 2/*DIAGNOSIS;MASS SCREENING/*PSYCHOLOGY;ADULT;AGED;BLOOD GLUCOSE/ANALYSIS;TYPE 2/PSYCHOLOGY;FAMILY PRACTICE;FEASIBILITY STUDIES;FEMALE;HEALTH STATUS;HUMANS;MALE;MIDDLE AGED;OUTCOME ASSESSMENT;HEALTH CARE;PATIENT ACCEPTANCE OF HEALTH CARE/STATISTICS & NUMERICAL DATA;PATIENT PARTICIPATION/PSYCHOLOGY;PILOT PROJECTS;PROGRAM EVALUATION;PSYCHIATRIC STATUS RATING SCALES;RISK FACTORS;SURVEYS AND QUESTIONNAIRES;UNITED KINGDOM;Anxiety;Mass Screening,,

One widely accepted explanatory model of frs suggests a deficiency in the internal forward model system. Recent studies in the field of cognitive sciences, however, have generated new insights into how complex sensory and motor systems contribute to the sense of self-recognition, and it is becoming clear that the forward model conceptualization does not have unique access to representations about the self. We briefly evaluate the forward model explanation of frs, reassess the distinction made between the sense of agency and body ownership, and outline recent developments in 4 domains of sensory-motor control that have supplemented our understanding of the processes underlying the sense of self-recognition. The application of these findings to frs will open up new research directions into the processes underlying these symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,PSYCHOSIS;SELF;AGENCY;BODY OWNERSHIP;INTERNAL FORWARD MODEL;;SENSORY-MOTOR;Schizophrenia,,

Methods: this is a secondary analysis of data from the cross-sectional, mixed-method provivo study, which included 376 survivors from two swiss hsct-centres. First, we analysed the sample characteristics and the distribution for each bipq item. Secondly, we tested three validity types following the american educational research association (aera)standards: content validity indices (cvls) were assessed based on an expert survey (n = 9). A confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) explored the internal structure, and correlations tested the validity in relations to other variables including data from the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), the number and burden of late effects and clinical variables. Results: in total, 319 hsct recipients returned completed bipqs. For this sample, the most feared threat for post-transplant life was long lasting late effects (median = 8/10). The expert-survey revealed an overall acceptable cvi (0.82), three items on personal control, treatment control and causal representation yielded low cvis (<.78). The cfa confirmed that the bipq fits the underlying construct, the common-sense model (csm) (chi(2) (df) = 956.321, p = 0.00). The hads-scores correlated strongly with the item emotional representation (r = 0.648; r = 0.656). Conclusion: according to its overall content validity, the german bipq is a promising instrument to gain deeper insights into patients' perceptions of hsct late effects. However, as three items revealed potential problems, improvements and adaptions in translation are therefore required. Following these revisions, validity evidence should be re-examined through an in-depth patient survey. (C) 2017 elsevier ltd.

The crises with escalating overdose mortality in several countries, particularly overdoses related to opioids, have drawn attention to life course shifts in the burdens of substance use. Overdose mortality rates for individuals in midlife have considerably outpaced those of adolescents and individuals in early adulthood. These diverging life course trends are occurring not only in the united states, but in other countries with growing overdose problems as well. The future of effective policy and practice depend upon evidence and analyses that adapt to emerging data on shifting life course trends in drug related mortality. Within this manuscript, we consider a range of theoretical possibilities on the divergence of midlife drug mortality trends from those of young people for the purpose of outlining an agenda for future research and practice. Specifically, we consider the following theoretical approaches to move research forward in this area: changes in medical context hypothesis; emergent comorbidities hypothesis; cohort hypothesis; generational forgetting hypothesis; legal regulation hypothesis; strength of life course bonds hypothesis; deepening inequality hypothesis; measurement reliability hypothesis. These theoretical frameworks attend specifically to the overdose crisis but extend to other aspects of substance use. Beyond setting an agenda for research by providing empirically verifiable hypotheses, this manuscript also identifies future directions in policy and practice that are attentive to life course trends.; Competing interests: declarations of interest regarding the paper “developing explanatory models for life course shifts in the burden of substance use to inform future policy and practice” recently submitted to the international journal of drug policy, the authors – brian c kelly and mike vuolo – have no actual or potential conflicts of interest to report.

These include a number of physical symptoms and also certain clinical syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome among others. However, it is increasingly recognized that such patients have larger degrees of psychological morbidities, especially depressive and anxiety disorders, and have disproportionately elevated rates of medical care utilization, including outpatient visits, hospitalizations and total healthcare costs. In view of this psychological morbidity, significant distress and functional impairment, the role of the consultation-liaison psychiatrist is prominent in the management of these patients. A consultation-liaison (cl) psychiatrist is expected to be part of the primary care team to manage patient with unexplained ss, and at the same time is expected to guide colleagues to practice a patient-centred approach to improve the outcome of patients with such symptoms. The clinical work of a cl psychiatrist involves evaluation of patients with medically unexplained symptoms for probable psychiatric disorders and treatment of psychiatric morbidity and also management of patients without psychiatric morbidity.

Attributional style was originally proposed as a cognitive factor of depression. Seligman and his colleagues introduced the concept of attributional style with three parameters (internality, stability and globality) and proposed a distinction between optimistic and pessimistic attributional styles. Recently, the focus in attributional style research has shifted from helplessness, depression, and pessimism toward the relationship between optimistic attributional style and psychological well-being. The association between attributional style for positive events and achievement has received relatively little research attention so far, although the findings are promising. The studies exploring the relation of attributional style to achievement in different domains have produced contradictory results. The association of explanatory style for negative events with professional success was first shown by seligman and shulman in an insurance agent sample. The research exploring the association of attributional style for negative events with academic and sports achievement was most extensive and also the most contradictory in terms of outcomes. The association between attributional style for positive events and achievement has received relatively little research attention so far, although the findings are promising. Two studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between explanatory style for positive and negative events, well-being, and performance in two different academic settings, and are reviewed in this chapter.

The current study sought to refine the contextual model of marital interaction by examining the main effects maladaptive attributions and dyadic behavior as well as interactions among these variables, as predictors of longitudinal relationship satisfaction in engaged and newlywed samples. Three general hypotheses were tested. First, it was hypothesized that maladaptive attributions and negative dyadic behavior, separately, would predict more rapid declines in satisfaction. Second, it was hypothesized that positive dyadic behavior would predict slower declines in satisfaction. Finally, it was hypothesized that proximal context attributions and dyadic behavior would interact to predict changes in satisfaction, whereas distal context relationship beliefs and dyadic behavior would not. Results indicated that more adaptive cognitive processing in both the proximal and distal context weaken the effects of negative verbal behaviors or less positive verbal behaviors on relationship satisfaction, whereas more maladaptive processing in both contexts exacerbate the negative effects of these types of behavior. Furthermore, both proximal and distal context variables interacted with more ambiguous behaviors (i.e., anxiety) to predict relationship satisfaction. The results constrained the contextual model by demonstrating that the ways in which spouses process less ambiguous nonverbal affective behaviors, such as negative affect, do not appear to alter the effects of such behaviors on relationship satisfaction.

These rhythms are disrupted in individuals with eating disorders; mealtime peaks are blunted and delayed relative to sleep/waketimes. Individuals with eating disorders also tend to experience an overall phase delay in appetite; they lack hunger earlier in the day and experience atypically high hunger later in the day, the latter of which may culminate in binge-eating episodes. This disruptive appetitive behavior-early in the day restrictive eating and later in the day binge eating-may be partially accounted for by circadian disruptions, which play a role in coordinating appetitive rhythms. Moreover, restrictive eating and binge eating themselves may further disrupt circadian synchronization, as meal timing serves as one of many external signals to the central circadian pacemaker. Here, we introduce the biobehavioral circadian model of restrictive eating and binge eating, which posits a central role for circadian disruption in the development and maintenance of restrictive eating and binge eating, highlighting modifiable pathways unacknowledged in existing explanatory models. Evidence supporting this model would implicate the need for biobehavioral circadian regulation interventions to augment existing eating disorder treatments for individuals experiencing circadian rhythm disruption. Public significance existing treatments for eating disorders that involve binge eating and restrictive eating mandate a regular pattern of eating; this is largely responsible for early behavioral change. This intervention may work partly by regulating circadian rhythm and diurnal appetitive disruptions. Supplementing existing treatments with additional elements specifically designed to regulate circadian rhythm and diurnal appetitive rhythms may increase the effectiveness of treatments, which presently do not benefit all who receive them.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,APPETITIVE RHYTHM;BINGE EATING;CIRCADIAN RHYTHM;DIURNAL APPETITE;;EATING DISORDERS;RESTRICTION;RESTRICTIVE EATING;Bulimia;Eating,,

Although it is often hypothesized that showing an internalizing emotional style is related to depression, this is the first study to fully examine this and to investigate its relative importance as compared to attributional style, which research has documented as a correlate of depression. Self-report and observational measures of emotional and attributional style were used to examine these styles as correlates of depressive symptoms and as potential mediators of the link between gender and depressive symptoms in 100 18- and 19-year old college students. Students were observed while interacting with a friend in a frustrating situation. This methodology allowed for a more complete analysis of emotional style than previous studies that did not use observations of emotion expression. Findings contributed to the literature by documenting that both internalizing emotional factors (feeling sad, suppressing anger displays) and pessimistic attributional styles were unique predictors of depressive symptoms, and found that emotional style tended to be particularly predictive in the presence of negative life events. Also, as predicted, females showed greater levels of depressive symptoms than males. However, this was not accounted for by emotional or attributional style. Lastly, there was a trend for exaggerated happiness expressions (showing high levels of happiness with a friend, even while generally feeling low levels of happiness) predicted depression. The present study highlights the importance of considering emotions, even anger and happiness, in models of depression. It also supported an additive model of emotional style and attributional style together predicting depressive symptoms, rather than one being primary.

R. Wageck et al. (See record [rid]2018-29309-007[/rid]). In their analysis, wageck et al. Describe a positive association between number of hospitalizations and coronary calcium score (ccs), a well-defined predictor of cardiovascular mortality in the general population, in individuals with bipolar disorder (bd). In the discussion, the authors hypothesize that the activation of inflammatory response which is associated with mood episodes, especially more severe episodes, may be a causal explanation for the premature onset or progression of atherosclerotic pathology, although inflammatory status was not assessed in the study. While the results of this study still need to be replicated, they provide novel insights into the systemic pathophysiology associated with severe and recurrent mood disorders. In addition to being neuroprogressive illnesses, mood disorders are perhaps more comprehensively conceptualized as conditions of multisystemic progression.in accordance with this view, multisystemic progression would be mediated by persistent inflammatory activation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. Within this framework, cardiovascular disease seems to be a final common endpoint of the alterations and effector systems mentioned earlier.

Methodologies range from epidemiological to anthropological/ethnographic to health services research; mixed methods research is becoming increasingly popular, as are public health and health promotional topics. After briefly outlining the history of cultural psychiatry in the uk we will discuss contemporary research. Prominent themes include: the epidemiology of schizophrenia among africans/afro-caribbeans, migration and mental health, racism and mental health, cultural identity, pathways to care, explanatory models of mental illness, cultural competence, and the subjective experiences of healthcare provision among specific ethnic groups such as bangladeshis and pakistanis. Another strand of research that is attracting increasing academic attention focuses upon the relationship between religion, spirituality, and mental health, in particular, the phenomenology of religious experience and its mental health ramifications, as well as recent work examining the complex links between theology and psychiatry. The paper ends by appraising the contributions of british cultural psychiatrists to the discipline of cultural psychiatry and suggesting promising areas for future research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ANTHROPOLOGY;EPIDEMIOLOGY;TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY;UNITED KINGDOM,,

Participants with insomnia (n = 69) completed a qualitative and quantitative assessment of their folk theories. The qualitative assessment was to speak aloud for 1 min in response to: `what do you think causes your insomnia?'. The quantitative assessment involved completing the `causal attributions of my insomnia questionnaire' (cam-i), developed for this study. The three most common folk theories for both the causes of one's own insomnia as well as insomnia in others were `emotions', `thinking patterns' and `sleep-related emotions'. Interventions targeting these factors were also perceived as most likely to be viable treatments. Seventy-five percent of the folk theories of insomnia investigated with the cam-i were rated as more likely to be alleviated by a psychological versus a biological treatment. The results are consistent with research highlighting that folk theories are generally coherent and inform a range of judgments. Future research should focus on congruence of `folk theories' between treatment providers and patients, and the role of folk theories in treatment choice, engagement, compliance and outcome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,INSOMNIA;FOLK THEORIES;CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,

Some support participants believed that unintentional drug use had precipitated the onset of mental illness or had no causal theories. The fact that some support participants could not identify a causal explanation may indicate failure on the part of mental health care systems to engage with consumers’ social support networks and provide education about mental illness and its causes.

Our work is based on the analysis of the scientific literature including original articles, literature reviews as well as meta-analysis. Methodology. - in order to identify the most pertinent studies in the electronic search, the three following databases were systematically searched: pubmed, psycinfo and medline. For both the analysis and synthesis we selected original articles, literature reviews as well as meta-analysis referring to any cognitive explanation of the auditory hallucinatory experience in schizophrenia. A cognitive model of auditory hallucinations refers to any incorporation of cognitive frameworks and explanations in one's conceptualization of the hallucinatory phenomenon in schizophrenia. We also focused our work on past conceptualization of auditory hallucinations in order to explain the development and the contribution of current cognitive models in the understanding of the onset and the maintaining of avhs. After a brief review of clinical characteristics and historical conceptualization of auditory verbal hallucinations, contemporary explanations were presented in the area of schizophrenia. These explanations referred to researches into cognitive psychopathology including metacognitive as well as neuroimaging studies. Results. - the examination of scientific literature highlighted the complexity of avhs through multifactorial explanations here mostly explained by cognitive and metacognitive deficits. We synthesized former conceptualizations of avhs, which were sustained on mechanistic or sensory explanations. Esquirol, baillarger and briere de boismont were the first as conceiving avhs as a perception disorder and introduced the idea that auditory hallucinations resulted from a failure to control one's memories/fantasies. Later, broca and wernicke discovered auditory areas in the human brain implicated in language comprehension and production. Avhs began to be conceptualized by the scientific world as being mechanistically brain-related. Sigmund freud was among the first to study the meaning of avhs, a domain still being investigated by to-days cognitive sciences. More recently, neuroimaging studies allowed the validation of these sensory explanations in considering the onset of avhs through the deficit of cortical and subcortical areas implicated in the process of languages (e.g. Broca and wernicke areas) and emotions (e.g. Limbic system, amygdala, hippocampus). At a more mechanistic level, contemporary cognitive models of avhs explained avhs as an intrusive verbal representation into the awareness which is non-inhibited (i.e. Deficit in intentional inhibition) and also non-recognized as one's own experience (i.e. Deficit in source monitoring, planning and metacognition), or even attributed to an external source (attribution bias). In terms of inhibitory control, inhibition is a basic cognitive mechanism defined as a collection of processes that allows the suppression of previously activated cognitive contents and the clearing of irrelevant actions or attention from consciousness. Intentional inhibition is effortful and occurs when an individual deliberately suppresses the activation of an item after deciding it is irrelevant. Theoretical support for the suggestion that an inhibitory failure is involved in avhs in schizophrenia arises from studies that have shown that a failure in inhibition results in intrusive thoughts from long-term memory. Recent findings also found that individuals with avhs in schizophrenia demonstrated an impaired source monitoring. In episodic memory research, a distinction was made between content (an event) and context (e.g. Source or temporal characteristics of an event) information. The context of memories provides cues that allow an individual to differentiate one memory from other memories. Avhs are conceptualized as a failure to access the contextual cues that would allow voice-hearer to form an intact representation of events in memories. Regarding planning, avhs refer to the intrusion of unwanted memories into the inner speech that are not recognized from one's own representation. Previous cognitive theories highlighted the important role played by metacognitive skills and belief (i.e. Thinking about one's thinking) in the explanation of avhs. Finally, the external attribution bias was extensively studied over the last three decades and refers to the tendency to attribute negative events (situational or cognitive) to an external source. In this framework, avhs refer to intrusive thoughts externally attributed to a voice. Conclusion. - for more than one century, scientific discoveries in (bio)medical science have allowed the validation of former sensory and mechanistic explanations of avhs. Nevertheless, many explanatory models account for the way avhs are maintained (source monitoring, deficit in planning, externalizing bias), while they scarcely expose how they are triggered (intrusive thoughts, deficit in inhibition). The relation between avhs and intrusive thoughts still remain unclear, and further studies are needed for the understanding of a potential causal relationship.

To investigate the neural correlates of such hostile attributions of social intention, we performed a functional magnetic imaging study in 10–18 year old children and adolescents. Fifty healthy participants rated videos of laughter, which they were told to imagine as being directed towards them, as friendly versus hostile in social intention. Hostile intention ratings were associated with neural response in the right temporal voice area (tva). Moreover, self-reported trait physical aggression modulated this relationship in both the right tva and bilateral lingual gyrus, with stronger associations between hostile intention ratings and neural activation in children with higher trait physical aggression scores. Functional connectivity results showed decreased connectivity between the right tva and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with increasing trait physical aggression for making hostile social intention attributions. We conclude that children's social intention attributions are more strongly related to activation of early face and voice-processing regions with increasing trait physical aggression.

In fact, anger has been coined 'the forgotten emotion,' mostly due to overlap and confusion with other constructs such as hostility, aggression and violence. Trait anger, a relatively new construct that describes someone with high proneness and frequency of angry experience, has emerged as a distinct entity, as researchers have attempted to measure it. Although many trait anger individuals are diagnosed with depression, the two pathologies may operate very differently in individuals. This study compared sample groups high in depression with sample groups high in trait anger using a cross-sectional study. A 2 (high-low anger) x 2 (high-low depression) design examined several variables: attribution style, dependency, dominance, submissiveness and 'personalized need for power.' In addition, a mixed design examined whether participants in these four cells responded to state measures assessing anger, sadness, dominance, 'need for power,' and attribution-style differentially over time following a velten mood induction for anger. From an initial sample of 306 participants recruited from undergraduate college psychology classes, 136 participants met criteria for high-low anger and high-low depression. Results of cross-sectional analyses showed both similarities and differences among the dependent measures. High trait anger groups scored higher on measures of dominance and 'need for power' than low trait anger groups. High depression groups scored higher than low depression groups on measures of internal attribution and dependency. Both high trait and high depression groups scored lower than others on measures of efficacy. Other findings demonstrated unexpected similarities among trait anger and depression. As found in the high depression group, the high trait anger group demonstrated an internal attribution style rather than an external attribution style. Like comparisons of high vs. Low depression groups, the high trait anger group scored higher on measures of dependency and submissiveness than the low trait anger group. The high depression group scored higher on a measure of 'need for power' than the low depression group. Results comparing state pre-test to post-test measures following a velten anger induction indicated that all participants reported increased anger and sadness across time following the anger induction. Participants showed an increase in dominance across time following the anger induction, and an interaction effect showed that the low anger group increased in dominance at a higher rate across time when compared to the high anger group. Results did not support the notion that anger would induce external attribution style states simulating a blaming attitude.

Comparisons of perceptions of intervention for an externalizing problem (gang-related behavior) and an internalizing problem (depression) are made in a group of children who have received mental health services, their parents, and a matched community sample. A significant interaction between respondent and group membership was present in the perception that these problems could be helped, and contrary to past findings among asian americans, both children and parents generally endorsed the use of mental health services.

Attitude measures were administered to young new zealand adults before and after a video portraying a young man with psychotic symptoms followed by either biogenetic or psychosocial explanations. Consistent with previous studies, the ``medical model'' approach significantly increased perceptions of dangerousness and unpredictability. Following the psychosocial explanation there was a slight but statistically insignificant improvement in attitudes. Participants who knew users of psychiatric services, or who had used services themselves, had more positive attitudes than other participants. It is recommended that destigmatization programs minimize efforts to persuade the public that mental health problems are biogenetic illnesses, and focus instead on increasing exposure to users of mental health services. Further research is required to determine whether such exposure should include life histories, so as to highlight the psychosocial causes of mental health problems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,NA;Mentally Ill Persons,,
rayyan-984749112,"[Substance Use, Affective Problems And Personality Traits: Test Of Two Association Models].",2004,1,1,L'ENCEPHALE,,,,,CHAKROUN N and DORON J and SWENDSEN J,,,,,"Unlabelled: the international consortium of psychiatric epidemiology has confirmed the high comorbidity in community-drawn samples between substance use disorders and anxiety or depression. In the same way, associations between substance use and specific personality traits (such as novelty seeking, harm avoidance or antisocial personality) have also been extensively documented. Self-medication and social deviance are among the most commonly evoked explanatory models for these forms of comorbidity, and are based on findings that affective disorders and specific personality traits often precede the onset of substance use disorders. The self-medication model postulates that an individual chooses a specific substance according to its psychopharmacologic action on the given psychological state of the person. By contrast, the social deviance model posits that this form of comorbidity is due to the fact that persons consuming certain substances may have affective or personality characteristics that are more severe or more deviant than non-consumers (or than consumers of socially well-accepted substances). In this way, the individual does not use a particular substance to assuage pre-existing disorders but, due to a more deviant personality, is less influenced by social norms and may more easily turn to using illicit substances or to polyconsumption. However, a major limitation of the current scientific literature concerning tests of these models is that previous investigations have been based in overwhelming majority on clinical populations. The examination only of clinical samples renders difficult the identification of causal (or primary) risk factors for the emergence of substance use disorders from the potential consequences of substance use itself. The goal of the current study was therefore to simultaneously compare both models of association using a non clinical population of substance users. In addition to selecting subjects based on use (rather than abuse or dependence), multiple comparisons were corrected with a bonferroni adjustment.; Method: a two-phase sampling plan was used with post-stratification on substances use. In the first stage, an initial sample of 685 students was pre-selected based on responses to a battery of self-questionnaires, including information concerning recent consumption of substances (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, heroin, acid, solvents, and so on), anxiety levels measured by the state and trait anxiety inventory (stai, spielberger, 1983) and depression levels evaluated by the center of epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d, radloff, 1977). Based on responses to these questionnaires, 98 subjects were selected in the second phase to compose four groups of substance users: non consumers (those who did not use any substance during the last month); consumers of alcohol only, consumers of cannabis (with or without alcohol) and consumers of other illicit substances (with or without cannabis or alcohol). These subjects were then invited to participate in a brief laboratory-based meeting where they completed the temperament and character inventory (tci, cloninger, 1992), which assessed different personality characteristics such as novelty seeking (ns), harm avoidance (ha) or antisocial personality disorder (apd).; Analyses: the hypotheses concerning self-medication were tested by multiple logistic regression by comparing each group of substance consumption to the non-consumer group relative to levels of anxiety, depression and scores of novelty seeking and harm avoidance. The social deviance model was tested by anovas using contrasts which allowed for a test of a linear tendency across the four groups of consumption relative to each of the personality traits (novelty seeking, harm avoidance and antisocial personality).; Results: results of multiple logistic regressions showed no difference between non-consumers and any group of consumers with regard to anxiety, depression and harm avoidance. However, consumers of other illicit substances significantly differed from non-consumers for novelty seeking trait (qor=8.4; p<0.05). Results of the anova also showed no differences between the four groups with regard to scores of harm avoidance and level of antisocial personality but again a comparison of novelty seeking scores was significant, f(94)=6.46, p<0.05. Moreover, the contrast method demonstrated that novelty seeking scores increased linearly and significantly (p<0.001) from the group of non-consumers to the group of the consumers of the most deviant substances.; Conclusion: the results obtained in this non-clinical sample are in favor of social deviance model which posits that the personality trait of novelty seeking is associated to the consumption of the most illicit and deviant substances (such as heroin or cocaine). On the other hand, no support was found for the hypothesis of self-medication which assumes that specific substances should be particularly associated with specific psychological characteristics or vulnerabilities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS*;ALCOHOLISM/*PSYCHOLOGY;ANXIETY DISORDERS/*PSYCHOLOGY;DEPRESSIVE DISORDER/*PSYCHOLOGY;PERSONALITY INVENTORY/*STATISTICS & NUMERICAL DATA;SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS/*PSYCHOLOGY;ADOLESCENT;ADULT;ALCOHOLISM/DIAGNOSIS;ALCOHOLISM/EPIDEMIOLOGY;ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER/DIAGNOSIS;ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER/EPIDEMIOLOGY;ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER/PSYCHOLOGY;ANXIETY DISORDERS/DIAGNOSIS;ANXIETY DISORDERS/EPIDEMIOLOGY;COMORBIDITY;CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES;DEFENSE MECHANISMS;DEPRESSIVE DISORDER/DIAGNOSIS;DEPRESSIVE DISORDER/EPIDEMIOLOGY;DIAGNOSIS;DUAL (PSYCHIATRY);EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR;FEMALE;FRANCE;HUMANS;MALE;PERSONALITY DISORDERS/DIAGNOSIS;PERSONALITY DISORDERS/EPIDEMIOLOGY;PERSONALITY DISORDERS/PSYCHOLOGY;PSYCHOMETRICS/STATISTICS & NUMERICAL DATA;REPRODUCIBILITY OF RESULTS;RISK FACTORS;SELF MEDICATION/PSYCHOLOGY;STUDENTS/PSYCHOLOGY;SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS/DIAGNOSIS;SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS/EPIDEMIOLOGY,,

Phenomenological descriptions of shame indicate that shame arises from internal, stable and global causal attributions (negative attributions) for the precipitating event. The current study investigated whether negative attributions would be associated with higher levels of shame and ptsd, and whether shame would mediate the relationship between causal attributions and ptsd. As negative attributions may reflect a common transdiagnostic process in both depression and ptsd, it also examined whether depression would moderate this relationship. Eighty-seven participants meeting criteria for a criterion a stressor were administered a structured ptsd diagnostic interview and a series of self-report measures. Findings indicate that shame mediated the relationship between internal, stable and global trauma-related causal attributions and ptsd symptoms. Further, depression did not moderate this relationship, indicating that negative causal attributions are associated with shame and ptsd independent of depression. Results provide empirical support for the cognitive concomitants of trauma-related shame, which raise the possibility that addressing negative attributions through cognitive therapeutic methods may be pertinent in reducing trauma-related shame.

Sampling and methods: the present study investigated the influence of westernization, stigma, severity of symptoms, and other factors on the symptom presentation of 60 south indian psychiatric patients, using both open-ended and symptom-directed interviewing methods. Symptom presentation was explored in terms of a balance of psychological and somatic symptoms. Results: participants predominantly emphasized somatic symptoms as their first spontaneously reported symptom. More westernized participants and those with higher symptom severity scores tended to present a more psychological balance of symptoms. Participants with a greater concern about stigma tended to present a more somatic balance of symptoms.

Genetic attributions can increase the desire to remain distant from someone with a mental illness (desire for social distance), reduce one’s beliefs that an ill person can get better (prognostic pessimism), and cause people living with mental illness to be perceived as more dangerous. Presenting information about how mental illnesses can be treated alongside a genetic causal attribution may combat these negative side effects. Participants (n = 268) were recruited through amazon’s mechanical turk to read vignettes about a man ('john') with schizophrenia. Participants randomly received either a genetic or environmental attribution for john’s illness, and then received treatability information or no information. A genetic explanation of schizophrenia led people to believe that the symptoms of schizophrenia described in the vignette were more permanent, p < .01, <U+03B7>p²= .07; however, this finding was qualified by a significant interaction where the type of attribution had no impact on prognostic pessimism when presented with treatability information, p = .04, <U+03B7>p² = .01.

Establishing diagnoses for pathological grief may lead to stigmatization. Additionally, it has been argued that people experiencing severe grief responses after loss of non-family members (i.e., disenfranchised grief) may experience more stigmatizing reactions. Yet, no research to date has investigated this. To fill this gap in knowledge, 379 adults from the general population were randomly allocated to read one of 4 different vignettes of a person with and without a grief disorder diagnosis who had lost a friend or a spouse.

Notably, people with a diagnosis were attributed relatively more negative characteristics, and elicited more anger, anxiety and pro-social emotions and a stronger desire for social distance. Stigmatization and its negative consequences appear a valid concern to the establishment of pathological grief disorders in diagnostic manuals.

However, the effect of religion as a cultural determinant of treatment utilization is largely understudied. Previous studies suggest that religious fundamentalists are more likely to endorse spiritual and demonic explanations for mental illness and are less willing to seek help from secular mental health professionals. However, these studies are based on small, regional, non-probability samples and have failed to adequately control for the effects of other sociodemographic variables such as education. This study utilized data from two nationally representative surveys, the 1996 and 1998 general social surveys (gss), to examine the effect of beliefs about the authorship, inerrancy, and interpretation of the bible on beliefs about the perceived causes and preferred treatments for mental disorders. Respondents who said that they believed the bible was 'the word of god' and should be 'interpreted word for word' (bible believers) were more likely than other gss respondents to say that the vignette subject's condition was caused by 'his or her own bad character.' However, bible believers were just as likely as other respondents to say that the condition was caused by 'a chemical imbalance in the brain.' Bible believers were more likely than other respondents to say that the vignette character should 'talk to a minister, rabbi, priest, or other religious leader.' However, they were just as likely as other respondents to endorse that the vignette character 'go to a psychiatrist,' 'take prescription medication,' and 'go see a therapist or counselor, such as a social worker, psychologist, or other mental health professional.' Bible believers were more likely than other gss respondents to say that individuals should stop taking psychiatric medications as soon as symptoms subside. This study suggests that social workers should be aware of the potential clinical implications of bible believers' views regarding the causes and best treatments for mental disorders. It also suggests that more research is needed to further understand how these views may affect the course and outcome of mental health treatments.

They also reported lower stigma in form of a greater intentions to engage in contact with people with mental health problems. Furthermore, south asians reported higher beliefs in supernatural causes of psychosis than white british. Psychotic experiences moderated the effect of ethnic group on supernatural beliefs, with south asians reporting higher supernatural beliefs than white british when their own psychotic experiences were low to moderate.

Participants were 202 high school students in south korea who completed an online survey. The results confirmed the main effect of internal attributions in which those adolescents who blamed individuals for being obese demonstrated high levels of obesity stigma, indicating a need to communicate with adolescents regarding the causes of being overweight or obese. No main effects of external attributions and social media exposure were found. However, the interaction effect between external attributions and social media exposure was significant. This means that body image content emphasizing thinness and physical attractiveness on social media may have strengthened the obesity stigmatization through external attributions. The results of this study offer a useful direction for addressing the obesity stigma for adolescents in the rapidly evolving communication landscape.

Questionnaires were filled in to measure pain and function (functional index for hand osteoarthritis, fihoa), dissatisfaction with the appearance of the hands and its impact (aesthetic scales from the michigan hand outcomes questionnaire, mhq), anxiety and depression (the hospital anxiety and depression scale, hads), and illness perceptions (the revised illness perception questionnaire, ipq-r). Odds ratios (ors) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression as measures of relative risk for dissatisfaction with appearance or its impact, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (bmi), and joint-specific abnormalities (bony joint enlargements, deformities, or radiographic severity), self-reported pain and function.; Results: of 247 patients (mean age 61.6 years, 88% women), 63 (26%) were aesthetically dissatisfied and 33 (13%) reported impact on daily life due to dissatisfaction.

Whereas depressed patients interpret events negatively, healthy people show a self-serving bias (internal attribution of positive events and external attribution of negative events). Methods: using fmri, depressed patients (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15) were confronted with positive and negative social events and made causal attributions (internal vs. External). Functional data were analyzed using a mixed effects model. Results: behaviourally, controls showed a self-serving bias, whereas patients demonstrated a balanced attributional pattern. Analysis of functional data revealed a significant group difference in a fronto-temporal network. Higher activation of this network was associated with non self-serving attributions in controls but self-serving attributions in patients. Applying a psycho-physiological interaction analysis, we observed reduced coupling between a dorsomedial pfc seed region and limbic areas during self-serving attributions in patients compared to controls. Limitations: results of the ppi analysis are preliminary given the liberal statistical threshold. Conclusions: the association of the behaviourally less frequent attributional pattern with activation in a fronto-temporal network suggests that non self-serving responses may produce a self-related response conflict in controls, while self-serving responses produce this conflict in patients. Moreover, attribution-modulated coupling between the dorsomedial pfc and limbic regions was weaker in patients than controls. This preliminary finding suggests that depression may be associated with disturbances in fronto-limbic coupling during attributional decisions. Our results implicate that treatment of major depression may benefit from approaches that facilitate reinterpretation of emotional events in a more positive, more self-serving way.

Disparities in access to and quality of mental health care for latino immigrants in the united states are well documented. Lack of insurance and language barriers provide only a partial explanation for these inequities. Illness cognitions, including causal beliefs about depression may influence health care utilization and illness outcomes, but have not been well examined in previous research. Moreover, identification and treatment of depression may be difficult for primary care providers due to cultural differences in presentation of symptoms. The purposes of this cross-sectional study are: to explore causal attributions about depression; to identify psychosocial factors associated with these beliefs; and to describe the self-reported symptoms, illness labels and cultural idioms of distress of latino primary care patients. Methods. We interviewed 177 primary care patients with instruments to assess causal beliefs, depressive and somatic symptoms, ethnic identity and stigma. An exploratory factor analysis of the causal beliefs scale yielded three factors, 'balance,' 'psychosocial' and 'malevolent spirituality/transgressions' that were used as dependent variables in multivariate analyses. Results. Both psychological and religious (spiritual) explanations of illness were strongly endorsed by these respondents. Depressive symptoms, age, country of origin and religiosity were significant predictors of causal beliefs. Those with higher education were most likely to endorse psychosocial and balance causation beliefs. Stigma pertained to causal beliefs related to 'malevolent forces' and 'personal transgressions.' Participants' descriptions of symptoms had a predominantly somatic component. The most common complaints were ánimo bajo (low energy) and decaimiento (weakness). Conclusions. Latino respondents in primary care endorse a dual system of western-medicine and traditional causation beliefs about depression. These results suggest culturally-specific interventions for improving health literacy as well as strategies for improving communication with patients about depression. To enhance treatment of depression in the primary care setting, it is important to take into account culturally accepted expressions of distress, and the meaning of illness for the individual.

Stepwise regression analyses revealed that environmental resources were unrelated to negative affect which is influenced more by the life event and personal resource variables. The environmental resource variables, particularly interactions with friends and neighbors, mostly influenced positive affect. The explanatory model for well-being included multiple variables and explained 33 percent of the variance. Although background characteristics had the greatest impact, absence of hospitalization, higher mastery, higher self-esteem, contacts with friends, and interaction with neighbors enhanced well-being. The results support previous speculations on the importance of positive exchanges for positive affect. African-american widowers showed higher levels of well-being than caucasian widowers did, the results advance knowledge about differences among elderly men.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Results indicate significant differences between trained and untrained ss on knowledge of black culture and better behavioral performance (as rated by black confederates who were blind as to the training conditions) for ss receiving assimilator training followed by contact than the reverse condition.

Recognising this, the ugandan ministry of health recently released the child and adolescent mental health (camh) policy guidelines. However, for implementation to be successful the suggested policy changes must resonate with the service users. To better understand the sociocultural factors influencing parental mental help-seeking, we sought insights from parents in the mbale district of eastern uganda.methodin this qualitative study, eight focus group discussions were conducted with mothers and fathers in urban and rural communities. Parents of children younger than 10years were purposively selected to discuss a vignette story about a child with symptoms of depression or adhd as well as general themes relating to child mental illness. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis.resultsdescriptions of severe symptoms and epileptic seizures were emphasised when recognising problem behaviour as mental illness, as opposed to mere stubbornness' or challenging behaviour. A mixture of supernatural, biomedical, and environmental understandings as underlying causes was reflected in the help-seeking process, and different treatment providers and relevant institutions, such as schools, were contacted simultaneously. A notion of weakened community social support structures hampered access to care.conclusionawareness of symptoms closer to normal behaviour must be increased in order to improve the recognition of common mental illnesses in children. Stakeholders should capitalise on the common recognition of the importance of the school when planning the upscaling of and improved access to services. Multifactorial beliefs within the spiritual and biomedical realms about the causes of mental illness lead to multisectoral help-seeking, albeit without collaboration between the various disciplines.

This study evaluates the training status, confidence, reported assessment and management practices of different professional groups involved in caring for people with id, epilepsy and cb.; Methods: a cross sectional survey using a questionnaire developed by expert consensus which measured self-reported training status, confidence, and approaches to assessment and management of cb in people with id and epilepsy was distributed to practitioners involved in epilepsy and/or id.; Results: of the 83 respondents, the majority had either a psychiatry/id (n = 39), or neurology/epileptology background (n = 31). Psychiatry/id and neurology/epileptology had similar confidence in assessing cb in id-epilepsy cases, but psychiatry/id exhibited higher self-rated confidence in the management of these cases. While assessing and managing cb, psychiatry/id appeared more likely to consider mental health aspects, while neurology/epileptology typically focused on asm.; Conclusion: psychiatry/id and neurology/epileptology professionals had varying training levels in epilepsy, id and cb, had differing confidence levels in managing this patient population, and considered different factors when approaching assessment and management. As such, training opportunities in id should be offered to neurology professionals, and vice versa.

These findings are then compared to available literature on attribution theory, which concerns itself with public perceptions of the controllability and stability of various impairments. The sample included 35,763 allegations of discriminations filed by people with disabilities under the employment provisions of the americans with disabilities act. Group a included impairments deemed by corrigan et al. [1988] to be uncontrollable but stable: visual impairment (representing 13% of the total allegations in this study), cancer (12%), cardiovascular disease (19%), and spinal cord injuries (5%). The controllable but unstable impairments in group b included depression (38%), schizophrenia (2%), alcohol and other drug abuse (4%), and hiv/aids (7%). The equal employment opportunity commission had resolved all allegations in terms of merit resolutions (a positive finding of discrimination) and resolutions without merit. Allegations of workplace discrimination were found to center mainly on hiring, discharge, harassment, and reasonable accommodation issues. Perceived workplace discrimination (as measured by allegations filed with eeoc) does occur at higher levels in group b, especially when serious issues involving discharge and disability harassment are involved. With the glaring exception of hiv/aids, however, actual discrimination (as measured by eeoc merit resolutions) occurs at higher levels for group a.

In our studies, which looked at 4 pairs of functional and dysfunctional negative emotions (i.e., concern/anxiety, sadness/depression, remorse/guilt, annoyance/anger), 125 undergraduate students (study 1) and 60 psychotherapy patients reported on their appraisal, attributions, core relational themes, irrational beliefs, and emotions during past encounters associated with various negative events. Congruent with both smith and lazarus' (1993) appraisal theory and ellis' (1994) cognitive theory of emotion, the results of these two studies indicated that the emotions (both functional and dysfunctional negative emotions) were associated with both appraisal and core relational themes, while only dysfunctional feelings were associated with irrational beliefs; the impact of attributions on emotion was mediated by appraisal. Also, irrational beliefs were strongly associated with appraisal; while demandingness (dem) was associated more with primary appraisal, awfulizing/catastrophizing, low frustration tolerance, and global evaluation of human worth (including self-downing) were associated more with secondary appraisal. Dysfunctional emotions seem to involve primary appraisal associated with dem while functional emotions involve primary appraisal associated with preferences. These findings lend support to the status of appraisal, core relational themes and irrational beliefs as the proximal cognitive antecedents of emotion, and the status of irrational beliefs as a differencing factor between functional and dysfunctional emotions.

This requires an understanding of how distress is experienced. We conducted a qualitative grounded theory study to understand how mothers experience and manage distress in dhanusha, a low-resource setting in rural nepal. We also explored how distressed mothers interact with their families and the wider community. Methods: participants were identified during a cluster-randomised controlled trial in which mothers were screened for psychological distress using the 12-item general health questionnaire (ghq-12). We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with distressed mothers (ghq-12 score >= 5) and one with a traditional healer (dhami), as well as 12 focus group discussions with community members. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods and a model was developed to explain psychological distress in this setting. Results: we found that distress was termed tension by participants and mainly described in terms of physical symptoms. Key perceived causes of distress were poor health, lack of sons, and fertility problems. Tension developed in a context of limited autonomy for women and perceived duty towards the family. Distressed mothers discussed several strategies to alleviate tension, including seeking treatment for perceived physical health problems and tension from doctors or dhamis, having repeated pregnancies until a son was delivered, manipulating social circumstances in the household, and deciding to accept their fate. Their ability to implement these strategies depended on whether they were able to negotiate with their in-laws or husbands for resources. Conclusions: vulnerability, as a consequence of gender and social disadvantage, manifests as psychological distress among mothers in dhanusha. Screening tools incorporating physical symptoms of tension should be envisaged, along with interventions to address gender inequity, support marital relationships, and improve access to perinatal healthcare.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,NEPAL;SOUTH ASIA;PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS;POSTNATAL DEPRESSION;;PERINATAL COMMON MENTAL DISORDERS;MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH;RURAL HEALTH;Nepal,,

Spillover Of Negative Arousal From Inconsistent Information During Attitude Formation Diminishes Perceptions Of Well-Being,2012,1,1,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,RYDELL RJ and DURSO GRO,,,,,"This research examines the extent to which the negative arousal caused by valence inconsistent supraliminal behavioral information and subliminal primes during attitude formation affects people's perceptions of their current well-being. Participants who received inconsistent information about a novel individual during an impression formation task reported more negative arousal, lower self-esteem, greater depression, and greater perceived stress than those in a control condition. Mediational analyses indicated that negative arousal stemming from attitude formation with valence inconsistent information guided participants' responses to well-being measures via misattribution of this arousal. These results cannot be explained by a simple response bias because recall of negative physical symptoms in the past 2 weeks were unaffected by receiving valence inconsistent information. This research suggests that the spillover of negative arousal from attitude formation, when unable to be easily attributed to the attitude object, served as a cue that people utilized when determining how they felt.

This association also has translated into verdict and sentencing decisions in insanity cases, such that higher endorsement of fundamentalist beliefs was associated with more punitive decisions. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between fundamentalism and insanity defense attitudes is unclear. Two possible explanations for this relationship include that (a) fundamentalism is associated with more dispositional attributions, and (b) fundamentalism is associated with more authoritarian attitudes toward mental illness and the mentally ill. Using structural equation modeling, attributions and attitudes were tested as mediators of the relationship between fundamentalism and insanity defense attitudes (i.e., strict liability attitudes and injustice-danger attitudes). These relationships were examined for theists and nontheists separately. Results suggest that personal attributions mediate the relationship between fundamentalism and injustice-danger attitudes, but authoritarian attitudes mediated the relationship between fundamentalism and strict liability attitudes. These relationships were only significant for theists.

Various factors could affect this reluctance toward treatment, one of which is the public's lack of mental health literacy. This survey aimed to measure and compare mental health literacy in cambodia's urban and rural areas. Methodtours were held to hold seminars that provided information about mental health in the health centers around phnom penh (pp) and siem reap (sr), and a survey was conducted on mental health literacy for the participants before the seminar at each location. Anthony jorm's vignette of psychosis (young adult) and angermeyer's questionnaire were used. After the participants were classified into the ``agree group'' and ``disagree group'' for each item, the answers for each item given by the participants in pp and sr were compared using the chi-square test and the odds rate was calculated. Resultsthe participants in sr were more likely to give reasons such as inherited causes, economic problems, stress at work, or family problems as the cause of schizophrenia. The percentage of these beliefs about schizophrenia was relatively lower in pp than in sr. Regarding attitudes toward schizophrenia, the participants in sr were more likely to have negative views and predict negative prognoses than the participants in pp. As for participants' feelings about schizophrenia, the participants in sr reacted more strongly than those in pp. Even though the participants in sr reacted more negatively, they were sympathetic toward individuals with schizophrenia. Conclusionoverall, the participants in the sr group were more likely to have negative attitudes toward schizophrenia than those in the pp group.

Setting and participants: recently injured (n = 54) and noninjured (n = 184) adults were recruited from a hospital emergency department or the community. Thirty-eight individuals met the diagnostic criteria for a mild traumatic brain injury and 16 individuals received treatment for a minor traumatic non-brain injury. Main measures: standardized tests were administered to assess 4 postconcussion symptom types and theorized predictors including a physiogenic variable (injury type) and psychogenic variables (symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress) within 1 month of the injury. Results: in the injured sample, after controlling for injury type, demographics, and pain (chronic and current), a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the combination of psychological symptoms predicted affective (f-10,f-42 = 2.80, p = .009, r-change(2) = 0.27) but not other postconcussion symptoms types. Anxiety ( = .48), stress ( = .18), and depression ( = -.07) were not statistically significant individual predictors (p > .05). Cognitive and vestibular postconcussion symptoms were not predicted by the modeled factors, somatic sensory postconcussion symptoms were predicted by demographic factors only, and the pattern of predictors for the symptom types differed for the samples. Conclusions: traditional explanatory models do not account for these findings.

Psychosocial models of child development suggest that parental attributions of child and adult controllability could moderate this relationship between child disability status and behaviour. Methods: the influence of parental attributions of adult and child controllability on the relationship between problem behaviours and disability was explored in mothers of children with developmental disabilities (dd) (n = 20) with a mean age of 9 years 3 months (sd 24.6 months), and in mothers of typically developing (td) children (n = 26) with a mean age of 9 years 4 months (standard deviation 23.7 months). The dd group comprised 11 children with autistic spectrum disorders or other communication impairments, three children with down syndrome, one with cerebral palsy, one with attentional problems, and four with specific or complex developmental problems. Child behaviour was measured by the child behaviour checklist. Parental attributions were measured using a modified version of the parent attribution test and mothers were divided into higher and lower controllability groups on the basis of their responses on this test. Results: multivariate analysis of variance found significant group × adult controllability interaction effects for ‘aggressive behaviour’, ‘rule-breaking behaviour’, as well as borderline significant effects for ‘social problems’ and ‘other problems’. Simple effects analysis suggested that when mothers had lower attributions of adult controllability, there were indeed significantly more problem behaviours in the dd group, but when mothers had attributions of higher adult controllability there was no longer any significant difference in problematic behaviour between the two groups. Conclusions: parental attributions of controllability may moderate the well-established effect of disability on problem behaviour. Implications for parent intervention programmes are discussed.

Results: consistent with hypotheses, differences were observed between the adhd and non-adhd groups on both child and maternal attributions measures. Post hoc analyses in the adhd sample indicate that maternal, but not child, attributions differ as a function of medication status. Finally, correlations between child and maternal attributions were not found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: the findings suggest that the attributional styles of children with adhd may place them at risk for poor self-esteem and/or depression in later life. The attributions provided by these children's mothers appear to differ slightly as a function of medication status, a finding that may lend insight into factors that influence parental choice of intervention and/or changes over the course of treatment.

Twelve subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were compared with 12 normal controls and 12 depressed subjects in the psychiatric control group. All ss were aged 18–65 yrs. Subjects were asked to read a comic strip (with no verbal material) and to choose one of the two answer cards which seemed the most logical to complete the sequence based on the supposed mental state of the character. The results of this study confirm the principal hypothesis that schizophrenics with thought and language disorders have an impaired ability to attribute intentions and false beliefs as they figure in this experiment.

Arf consists of several combinations of carditis, polyarthritis and sydenham's chorea, and rarely seen erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules. Sydenham's chorea is seen in about 20% of patients with arf. As a late symptom of arf, sydenham's chorea usually occurs 3 months or longer after the streptococcal infection. Sydenham's chorea is a neuropsychiatric disorder that may present with emotional lability, anxiety, obsessive compulsive symptoms, attention deficit and hyperactivity symptoms or tics. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms occur in 70% of patients with sydenham's chorea. The role of the autoimmune mechanisms and the dysfunction of the basal ganglia have been demonstrated in sydenham's chorea. Antibodies against group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus cross-react with basal ganglia. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (pandas) shares the same mechanism with sydenham's chorea, but pandas has not been shown to require penicillin prophylaxis. Thus it is important to distinguish between them. Sydenham's chorea is associated with adulthood ocd, tourette syndrome and schizophrenia. These features make sydenham's chorea an explanatory model for obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) and related disorders. This poststreptococcal disorder provides a treatment opportunity with new therapies like antibiotic therapy, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for psychiatric disorders. In this paper we summarize the phenomenological and treatment studies of ocd, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (adhd), and tic disorders in subjects with arf, with or without sydenham's chorea.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Chorea;Q Fever;Fever;Rheumatic Diseases,,

Many studies try to relate the sense of agency to an internal feed-forward mechanism, called the 'comparator model'. In this paper, we draw a sharp distinction between a non-conceptual level of feeling of agency and a conceptual level of judgement of agency. By analyzing recent empirical studies, we show that the comparator model is not able to explain either. Rather, we argue for a two-step account: a multifactorial weighting process of different agency indicators accounts for the feeling of agency, which is, in a second step, further processed by conceptual modules to form an attribution judgement. This new framework is then applied to disruptions of agency in schizophrenia, for which the comparator model also fails. Two further extensions are discussed: we show that the comparator model can neither be extended to account for the sense of ownership (which also has to be differentiated into a feeling and a judgement of ownership) nor for the sense of agency for thoughts. Our framework, however, is able to provide a unified account for the sense of agency for both actions and thoughts.

However, due to the complexity of brain function connectivity and the high dimensionality expression of brain dynamic attributions, more research studies are focusing on tracking the time-varying characteristics through the transition between different brain states. The transition process is considered to occur instantaneously at some special time point in the above research studies, whereas our work found the brain state transition may be completed in a time section gradually rather than instantaneously. In this paper, a brain state conversion rate model is constructed to observe the procedure of brain state transition trend at each time point, and the state change can be observed by the values of conversion rate. According to the results, the transition of status always lasts for a few time points, and a brain state network model with both steady state and transition state is presented. Network topological overlap coefficient is built to analyze the features of time-varying networks. With this method, some common regular patterns of time-varying characteristics can be observed strongly in healthy children but not in the autism children. This distinct can help us to distinguish children with autism from healthy children.

In-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers of hiv-positive children (5-11 years) and adolescents (12-17 years) in hiv care. Interviews were audio recorded with permission from participants and written consent and assent sought before study procedures. Thirty eight participants (19 caregivers, 19 children/adolescents) were interviewed. Age range of caregivers was 28-69 years; majority were female (17). Caregivers had little knowledge on mental disorders ;only 3 related the vignette to a mental problem and attributed it to: improper upbringing, violence, poverty and bereavement. Five adolescents identified vignettes as portraying mental disorders caused by: ill-health of parents, bereavement, child abuse, discrimination, hiv and poverty. Caregivers are not knowledgeable about behavioural and emotional challenges in hiv-positive children/adolescents.

We propose that blacks may be more skeptical than whites of genetic- and family-based explanations because of their resemblance to arguments that have been used to criticize blacks and justify their disadvantaged structural position. Additionally, we find that racial differences in etiological beliefs play a substantial part in explaining african americans' tendency to have more negative attitudes than whites toward professional mental health treatment these findings suggest not only that etiological beliefs may reflect broader political debates about race but also that these beliefs may be at the care of some of the differences in the attitudes of blacks and whites toward professional help-seeking.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,NA;African Continental Ancestry Group;European Continental Ancestry Group;Mentally Ill Persons,,

Methods: in a cross-sectional study, 202 service users with severe mental illnesses were interviewed to assess their reported experiences of discrimination. The major experiences of discrimination scale assessed major experiences of discrimination and their recency and frequency across 12 life domains and perceived reasons (attributions). The everyday experiences of discrimination scale assessed ten types of everyday discrimination and attributions for these experiences. Results: most participants (88\%) reported discrimination in at least one life domain, and 94\% reported ever experiencing everyday discrimination. The most common areas of major discrimination were mental health care (44\%), neighbors (42\%), police (33\%), employment (31\%), and general medical care (31\%). The most common attributions for major discrimination were mental illness (57\%), race-ethnicity (24\%), education or income (20\%), or appearance (19\%). Almost half (47\%) attributed experiences of major discrimination to two or more causes. No differences were found between racial-ethnic groups in overall experienced discrimination or in main attributions to mental illness. However, compared with the mixed and white groups, participants in the black group were most likely to endorse race-ethnicity as a main attribution (p<.001). Conclusions: mental illness-related discrimination was found to be a common issue across racial-ethnic groups, and discrimination based on race-ethnicity was prevalent for the mixed and black groups. There is a need for antidiscrimination strategies that combine efforts to reduce the experience of discrimination attributed to mental illness and to race-ethnicity for racial-ethnic minority groups.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Discrimination (Psychology);Continental Population Groups,,

Attribution theory suggests that attributions for psychological distress might inform help-seeking. Given recent mental health campaigns leveraging military values aimed at facilitating help-seeking for postdeployment distress, understanding how sm/vs explain psychological distress may contribute to a better grasp of the low help-seeking rate in this population. The authors examined the association of biological and psychological attributions for postdeployment distress with help-seeking intentions from a mental health professional and medical doctor in 162 iraq/afghanistan sm/vs. At the bivariate level, biological attributions were positively associated with help-seeking intentions from a mental health professional and medical doctor with small effect sizes. Psychological attributions were unrelated to help-seeking intentions from either provider. Path analysis revealed that biological attributions were positively correlated with help-seeking intentions from a medical doctor with a small effect size above and beyond the effects of psychological attributions and correlates. Biological attributions were also positively correlated with help-seeking intentions from a mental health professional with a small effect size but the significance value only trended toward significance (p = .06). Emphasizing the role of biology in postdeployment distress may promote help-seeking in sm/vs, particularly help-seeking from medical professionals. Interventions that test the effectiveness of promoting biological explanations in campaigns aimed at increasing help-seeking may be a necessary next step in this area of inquiry.

Stigma internalization is one of the main consequences of the stigmatization process, and it is associated with lower self-esteem and self-efficacy and worse recovery prospects. It may also bring guilt, hopelessness, anxiety, self-devaluation, and depression. This study investigated self-stigma among substance dependents who sought treatment, testing the construction of a psychosocial model for understanding this phenomenon. Individual interviews were conducted at the psychosocial care center for alcohol and drugs at juiz de fora, brazil. Data were subjected to exploratory statistical analysis, using descriptive and standard deviation. Three explanatory models of self-stigma were tested: the sociodemographic model, including variables such as gender, religious practice, education, marital status, employment status, and involvement in illicit activities; the psychological model, with variables related to symptoms of depression, self-esteem, and hope; and the psychosocial model, which included all sociodemographic and psychological variables. The sample was composed by 461 individuals. The results supported the hypothesis that the psychosocial model would have greater explanatory power of self-stigma among substance dependents. An association between self-stigma and the sociodemographic variables and the type of substance used was confirmed. Depressive symptoms contributed to higher scores on self-stigma. Stigma may be a barrier to access to health care, treatment, social research, social inclusion, and recovery opportunities. Interventions and treatment models that are able to reduce self-stigma would have the potential to contribute toward a reduction in the negative impacts associated with substance use disorder.

Although dyspareunia experienced after menopause is widely attributed to declining estrogen levels and vulvovaginal atrophy, critical reviews of the literature have suggested that these factors are incomplete as explanatory mechanisms. Little is known about psychosocial factors that may also be implicated in postmenopausal dyspareunic pain. Aim. To determine the extent to which levels of estrogens and progesterone, vulvovaginal atrophy, cognitive-emotional factors, and dyadic adjustment are predictive of postmenopausal dyspareunic pain intensity. Methods. A total of 182 postmenopausal dyspareunia sufferers underwent a structured interview concerning sociodemographic status as well as medical and pain histories, gynecological examination, cytological evaluation, a blood draw, and answered a series of self-report questionnaires. Given the large number of genital and pelvic pain variables measured, a principal components analysis was undertaken to identify a smaller number of components representing meaningful dimensions of genital and pelvic pain. Main outcome measures. Pain severity ratings during intercourse were obtained using the mcgill pain questionnaire. Pain ratings were also obtained during gynecological assessment. Serum estrone, estradiol, and progesterone levels were measured via immunoassay. The vaginal atrophy index and maturation value were used to determine vulvovaginal atrophy severity. Participants completed the pain catastrophizing scale, state-trait anxiety inventory, the beck depression inventory-ii, and dyadic adjustment scale. Results. Hormone levels were not found to be consistent predictors of pain severity. Maturation value and cognitive-emotional variables (e.g., catastrophization, depression, anxiety) were significant predictors of vestibular pain, which affected over 90\% of our sample. Relationship adjustment variables were inversely associated with pain severity within several genital locations. Conclusions. Results suggest that the traditional hypoestrogen and vulvovaginal atrophy conceptualization of postmenopausal dyspareunia is an insufficient explanatory model, and that pain is also influenced by cognitive, affective, and dyadic factors.

L. Kerr and j. M. Neale, 1993, fid), the discrimination of facial emotions test (s. L. Kerr and j. M. Neale, 1993, fdis), and the benton visual retention test (m. D. Lezak, 1983). Clinical symptoms were assessed with scales for the assessment of negative symptoms (n. C. Andreasen, 1983) and positive symptoms (n. C. Andreasen, 1984). Motor symptoms were assessed with side effects and aims scales and finger tapping test. Results show that negative symptoms were not related to fid or fdis. Fid showed significant correlation with visual retention and finger tapping, but not with mmse scores. It is concluded that the ability to identify facial emotional expressions is not related to negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia, and shares common mechanisms with visual reproduction and the ability to make rapid motor movements. This suggests common defects in perceptual, timed processes consistent with postulated dysfunction of cortico–subcortical circuits.

We aimed to compare frontal cortical thickness in first-episode schizophrenia (fes) patients with matched controls, and investigate its relationship with the symptom attribution dimension of insight in fes patients. Methods: we examined frontal cortical thickness in 92 minimally treated fes patients at baseline presentation and 93 healthy controls aged 16–45 years. We examined for correlations between symptom attribution as determined by the birchwood insight scale (bis) symptom relabeling subscale score and cortical thickness of frontal regions of interest (rois). We then examined for an association between symptom attribution and cortical thickness using multiple regression analysis. Results: fes patients exhibited significantly reduced cortical thicknesses for a number of frontal regions, namely the left medial orbitofrontal, left superior frontal, left frontal pole, right rostral middle frontal, right lateral orbitofrontal and right superior frontal regions. Reduced cortical thickness in fes patients was associated with symptom misattribution for the left and right rostral middle frontal, left caudal anterior cingulate, right superior frontal, and left and right pars triangularis regions. Reduced left rostral middle frontal thickness and left anterior cingulate thickness remained significant on regression analysis. Conclusion: our findings suggest that frontal neuroanatomical deficits that are present early in the disease process may be critical to the pathogenesis of symptom attribution in schizophrenia.

It is also the cornerstone for designing evidence-based community mental health interventions. However, the evidence is scarce in developing countries like ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the knowledge regarding mental health problems and associated factors among communities of jimma zone, oromia, ethiopia. Methods a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the jimma zone from march 1 to 22, 2020. A structured, pretested, and interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 420 study participants selected through a systematic sampling technique. The knowledge about mental health was measured by the adapted version of the mental health knowledge schedule tool. Data were entered into epi-data version 3.1 and exported to spss version 23.0 for analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done, and p-value < 0.05 and 95\% ci were used to determine the predictors of the outcome variable. Results the overall knowledge score showed (188, 44.8\%) of the respondents had inadequate knowledge. Moreover, (75, 17.9\%) of the respondents reported psychiatric disorders are contagious, and (138, 32.9\%) mentioned leaving alone is the treatment for mental illness. Talking or laughing alone and showing strange or unusual behaviors were described as symptoms of mental illness by the majority (407, 96.9\%) and (403, 96.0\%) of respondents, respectively. Brain dysfunction was attributed to the cause of mental illness by most (390, 92.9\%) of the study participants. Similarly, the percentage of responses that attributed the causes of mental illness to possession by an evil spirit, god's punishment, and witchcraft were significantly high (368, 87.6\%), (321, 76.4\%) and (259, 67.1\%), respectively. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that respondents who were able to read and write were 64\% less likely to have adequate knowledge than those in secondary school and above educational status (aor = 0.34, 95\% ci (0.16-0.69)). Conclusion knowledge of mental illness among the general public was relatively poor and higher levels of education were associated with good knowledge of mental health problems; this suggests the need for due emphasis on public education to improve the mental health literacy status of the community.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,KNOWLEDGE;PERCEPTION;MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS;COMMUNITY;JIMMA;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,

He saw a clear division between these two approaches and considered a number of psychotic symptoms to be fundamentally un-understandable. We here argue for an updating of jasper's view that includes the possibility, due to advances in neuroscience and neuropsychology, for explanation-aided understanding. We describe two scientific explanatory models for kinds of psychotic symptoms deemed un-understandable by jaspers that illustrate this process. The first describes how dysfunction of the brain dopamine salience system may produce ideas of reference. The second demonstrates that symptoms of made-actions may be caused by abnormalities in the feed-forward motor control system. Both of these models begin at a biological level describing pathological brain processes in neuroscience language but then utilize neuropsychology to `translate' from brain dysfunction into the mental. Both models break down the pathological pathways into individual subjective elements (particularly misattributing meaning to environmental stimuli and having body parts moved by others) that are understandable because they are common to nearly all of us. The neuropsychology provides hypotheses about the functional and physiological structures underlying familiar subjective experiences. Analyses of disorders of those structures thus provide a scaffold for expanding our empathic understanding of the subjective experiences of those suffering from psychiatric illness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,EXPLANATION;JASPERS;NEUROPSYCHOLOGY;PHILOSOPHY;UNDERSTANDING,,

The findings on prevalence rates of ptsd are quite heterogeneous and may also vary within the same population over time. Risk factors for ptsd may be more consistent over time and population group studied. Among the factors most frequently found to be associated with increased risk for ptsd is having a psychiatric history prior to the trauma. A meta-analysis by brewin et al, (2000) also found childhood abuse and a family history of psychiatric disorders to be consistently associated with ptsd risk. The study further found low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, life stress, lack of social support, trauma severity, adverse childhood and previous trauma to be consistently but to a differing degree related to an increased risk for ptsd. While protective effects of higher levels of intelligence have also been shown in a large prospective study in a cohort of adolescents independent of social and educational status, no explanatory model has yet been established.

Background: heart disease is the uk’s leading cause of death. Evidence from meta-analyses suggests that cardiac rehabilitation facilitates recovery following acute cardiac events. However, 30–60% of patients do not attend cardiac rehabilitation. There is some evidence from questionnaire studies that a range of potentially modifiable psychological variables including patients’ cardiac-related beliefs, motivation and mood may influence attendance. Design: mixed-methods. Methods: in this study, during 2012–2013, electronic diary data will be gathered weekly/monthly from 240 patients with acute coronary syndrome from discharge from hospital until completion of the cardiac rehabilitation programme. This will identify changes and interactions between key variables over time and their power to predict non-attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. Data will be analysed to examine the relationship between patients’ illness perceptions, cardiac treatment beliefs, knowledge/misconceptions, mood and non-attendance of the cardiac rehabilitation programme. The qualitative component (face-to-face interviews) seeks to explore why patients decide not to attend, not complete or complete the cardiac rehabilitation programme. Discussion: the identification of robust predictors of (non-)attendance is important for the design and delivery of interventions aimed at optimizing cardiac rehabilitation uptake.

The reporting of such injuries is a critical step in initiating early prophylaxis or treatment. Methods: we surveyed surgeons in training at 17 medical centers about previous needlestick injuries. Survey items inquired about whether the most recent injury was reported to an employee health service or involved a ``high-risk'' patient (i.e., one with a history of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis b or hepatitis c, or injection-drug use); we also asked about the perceived cause of the injury and the surrounding circumstances. Results: the overall response rate was 95\%. Of 699 respondents, 582 (83\%) had had a needlestick injury during training; the mean number of needlestick injuries during residency increased according to the postgraduate year (pgy): pgy-1, 1.5 injuries; pgy-2, 3.7; pgy-3, 4.1; pgy-4, 5.3; and pgy-5, 7.7.

The proposed analysis grounds mental causation in information-processing, which characterizes not only mental but also biological functions. It involves driving brentano's thesis downwards, with the argument that biological processes have (genuine) intentionality and that there is a seamless transition through developmental biology and psychology to mature human cognition. This is primarily a philosophical and conceptual case, drawing on examples from biological and psychological research. It aims to provide a justification for, and explicit statement of the implications of, assumptions that are already commonplace in the behavioural and neurosciences. In contrast with current philosophical analyses of the role of intentionality in behaviour, the analysis shows how the conditions for intentionality in the normal case contain the conditions for disordered functioning.

Ibds comprise two idiopathic disorders: crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc). The aetiology, severity and progression of such disorders are still poorly understood but thought to be influenced by multiple factors (including genetic, environmental, immunological, physiological, psychological factors and gut microbiome) and their interactions. The overarching aim of this review is to evaluate the extent and nature of the interrelationship between these factors with the disease course. A broader conceptual and longitudinal framework of possible neuro-visceral integration, core microbiome analysis and immune modulation assessment may be useful in accurately documenting and characterizing the nature and temporal continuity of crosstalk between these factors and the role of their interaction (s) in ibd disease activity. Characterization of these interactions holds the promise of identifying novel diagnostic, interventions, and therapeutic strategies. Material and methods: a search of published literature was conducted by exploring pubmed, embase, medline, medline plus, cdsr library databases. Following search terms relating to key question were set for the search included: ``inflammatory bowel diseases,'' ``gut microbiota,'' ``psychological distress and ibd,'' ``autonomic reactivity and ibd,'' ``immune modulation,'' ``chronic inflammation,'' ``gut inflammation,'' ``enteric nervous system,'' ``gut nervous system,'' ``crohn's disease,'' ``ulcerative colitis'' ``depression and ibd'' ``anxiety and ibd'' ``quality of life in ibd patients,'' ``relapse in ibds,'' ``remission in ibds,'' ``ibd disease activity,'' ``brain-gut-axis,'' ``microbial signature in ibd,'' ``validated questionnaires in ibd,'' ``ibd activity indices,'' ``ibd aetiology,'' ``ibds and stress,'' ``epidemiology of ibds'' ``autonomic nervous system and gut inflammation'' ``ibd and environment,'' ``genetics of ibds,'' ``pathways of immune response in ibds,'' ``sleep disturbances in ibd,'' ``hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (hpa),'' ``sympatho-adrenal axis,'' ``cns and its control of gut function'' ``mucosal immune response,'' ``commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut,'' ``innate and adaptive immunity.'' Studies evaluating any possible associations between gut microbiome, psychological state, immune modulation, and autonomic function with ibds were identified. Commonly cited published literatures with high quality research methodology/results and additional articles from bibliographies of recovered papers were examined and included where relevant. Results: although there is a substantial literature identifying major contributing factors with ibd, there has been little attempt to integrate some factors over time and assess their interplay and relationship with ibd disease activity. Such contributing factors include genetic and environmental factors, gut microbiota composition and function, physiological factors, psychological state and gut immune response. Interdependences are evident across psychological and biological factors and ibd disease activity. Although from the available evidence, it is implausible that a single explanatory model could elucidate the interplay between such factors and the disease course as well as the sequence of the effect during the pathophysiology of ibd. Conclusion: longitudinal monitoring of ibd patients and integrating data related to the contributing/risk factors including psychological state, physiological conditions, inflammatory/immune modulations, and microbiome composition/function, could help to explain how major factors associate and interrelate leading to exacerbation of symptoms and disease activity. Identifying the temporal trajectory of biological and psychosocial disturbances may also help to assess their effects and interdependence on individuals' disease status. Moreover, this allows greater insight into understanding the temporal progressions of subclinical events as potential ground for disease severity in ibd. Furthermore, understanding the interaction between these risk factors may help better interventions in controlling the disease, reducing the costs related to disease management, further implications for clinical practice and research approaches in addition to improving patients' mental health and quality of life.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,IBD;NEUROPSYCHOLOGY;IMMUNOLOGY;MICROBIOME;PHYSIOLOGY;AUTONOMIC;NERVOUS SYSTEM;IBD THERAPEUTIC;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,,

Drawing from evidence in the area of control and explanatory style, the present study used a cross-sectional design to evaluate structural models investigating the relation of perceived control and attribution to family environment, negative affect, and clinical disturbance. It was hypothesized that the anxiogenic and depressogenic influences of a controlling family environment on negative affect would be mediated by cognitive dimensions.

rayyan-984749220,Psychopathology As A Complex Network Of Causally Interacting Symptoms,2022,1,1,INTERDISCIPLINARIA,,,,,LUNANSKY G and JAVIER GARAY C,,,,,"Over the past years, psychopathology has frequently been represented as a complex system, where psychiatric symptoms are causally interconnected in a network architecture. The network theory of psychopathology has led to more than 300 novel publications, academic courses, methodology for estimating novel models, and freely available software. However, despite the success of this novel research avenue, all relevant information has mostly been published in english. This paper translates the network theory of psychopathology and its model, together with its relevance for research and clinical practice of psychology and psychiatry, to the spanish language. To serve the dissemination of this theory, this paper serves as an introductory paper for spanish scholars, for example, as a starting point to learn more about the approach or for academic courses. The main idea of the network theory of psychopathology is that the activation of one clinical symptom in the network leads to the activation of a neighboring symptom. If symptoms are strongly connected with each other, for example, excessive worry and insomnia, they are more likely to be in the same state, meaning that if a person faces a stressful life event such as losing one's job, the activation of the symptom excessive worry will increase the probability they will also suffer from insomnia. In this way, a whole symptom activation pattern develops from which mental disorders emerge. Mental disorders are conceived as stable states of strongly connected symptom networks, allowing for a common explanatory model for multiple mental disorders, thereby providing a comprehensive model of psychopathology. Traditional representations of mental disorders conceptualize symptoms as merely passive indicators of latent, underlying mental disorders which act as common causes for patients' symptomatology. The network theory of psychopathology flips the explanatory and statistical model: instead of focusing on one underlying cause or underlying causes, it proposes to study the direct interactions between these symptoms. This imposes two important implications for the conceptualization of mental disorders. First, symptoms are no longer statistically exchangeable since every symptom can have a different role in the onset and development of psychopathology. Some symptoms can be more important than others in keeping the whole system ``stuck'' in a disordered state. Second, comorbidity is conceptualized as clustering symptoms which are connected to each other via certain ``bridge symptoms''. Bridge symptoms are symptoms which are attributed to two (or more) mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder (mdd) and generalized anxiety disorder (gad). If a person suffers from symptoms of mdd, such as loss of motivation and depressed mood, this can lead to the activation of bridge symptoms such as fatigue and concentration problems, which by themselves lead to the activation of gad symptoms such as irritability and excessive worry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;NETWORK ANALYSIS;COMPLEX CAUSAL NETWORK;PSYCHIATRIC;SYMPTOMS;MENTAL DISORDERS;Causality,,

Ss were also asked questions assessing the accuracy of their perceptions of others. Depressed ss showed less false consensus than nondepressed ss. Although depressives characterized themselves as dissimilar to others, they showed no consistent bias to deprecate themselves relative to others. Nondepressives consistently enhanced themselves relative to others, although the magnitude of their self–other differences was smaller than that of depressives. The tendency to deprecate oneself relative to others on negative depression-relevant items was a better predictor of severity of depression than self-perceptions or other perceptions alone. Findings regarding the accuracy of perceptions of others were mixed. The discussion includes implications for the false-consensus effect, depressive attributional style, nondepressive self-serving biases, and therapy for depression.

The present study, using 68 undergraduate students, found that negative attributional style did not predict negative attributions subjects made for the negative life events they experienced within a period of 3 months. However, subjects' negative attributions for the negative life events coupled with the experience of a high number of negative life events predicted their depressive symptomatology. The depressive symptomatology is found not to be mediated through hopelessness. The findings are discussed in relation to the hopelessness theory of depression.

Subjects and methods: ten white women with confirmed vertebral compression fractures were age- and race-matched with 10 control subjects without fractures in a case-control design. All subjects invited to participate in this study were patients of the geriatrics division of the department of medicine at duke university medical center. All study participants lived either in the community or in the independent-living sections of local retirement communities in and around durham, nc. Subjects with fractures (mean age = 81.9 years, sd = .5 years) had two or more vertebral compression fractures in their medical records, whereas control subjects (mean age = 79.6 years, sd = 6.5 years) had no history of vertebral fractures spinal radiographs of all women confirmed group assignment. Physical, functional, and psychosocial performances were evaluated. Physical performance was assessed by measurements of maximal trunk extension torque and thoracic and lumbar spinal motion in the sagittal plane, functional reach, mobility skills, 10-ft timed walk, and 6-minute walk test. Thoracic and lumbar spinal configurations were also determined. Functional performance was assessed using the functional status index. Psychosocial performance was assessed with the following scales: hopkins symptom checklist 90 revised, rosenberg self-esteem scale, west haven-yale pain inventory, beck depression inventory, and single-item health-belief questions. Results: control subjects were not significantly different from patients with fractures in age, weight, number of current illnesses, number of prescribed medications, number of pain medications, ratings of lumbar spine degenerative disc disease, or lumbar spine facet joint arthritis. Activity levels and exercise participation were similar in both groups. Control subjects had no vertebral fractures, whereas fracture subjects had 4.2 +/- 2.6 fractures (range: 2 to 10). Thoracic kyphosis was increased and lumbar lordosis was reduced in fracture subjects. Fracture subjects had reduced maximal trunk extension torque, thoracic and lumbar spine sagittal plane motion, functional reach, mobility skills, and 6-minute walk test. The functional status index showed reduced levels of functional performance in fracture subjects compared with controls with increased levels of assistance, pain with activity, and difficulty in activities. Psychosocial performance was limited in fracture subjects with increased psychiatric symptoms, increased pain, and greater perception of problems caused by health.

In addition to traditional and non-traditional vascular risk factors–including most recently homocysteine, inflammation, and alterations of coagulation–a number of environmental risk factors for stroke have been identified in the last decade. In this update we review the following: lower education and poorsocioeconomic status (probable surrogates for exposure to traditional high-risk behaviors such as smoking, poor nutrition, lack of prenatal control, absence of preventive medical and dental care, and non-compliance of treatment of conditions such as hypertension); depression, stress and affectivedisorders; obstructive sleep apnea; passive smoking and environmental pollution; infections, in particular periodontal diseases that increase creactive protein (crp); raised body mass index (obesity); exercise, and diet. The possible role of high-fructose corn syrup in the epidemic of obesity in the usa is reviewed. Protective diets include higher consumption of fish, olive oil, grains, fruits and vegetables (mediterranean diet), as well as probiotic bacteria in yogurt and dairy products. Careful attention should be given to the patient's environment looking for modifiable factors. The effects of clean environmental air and water, adequate diet and appropriate nutrition, healthy teeth, exercise, and refreshing sleep in the prevention of stroke and cardiovascular disease appear to be quite compelling. Although some of these modifiable risk factors lack evidence-based information, judicious clinical sense should be used to counteract the potentially damaging effects of adverse environmental vascular risk factors.

Most parents had heard about adhd and considered themselves knowledgeable about it but were unaware of relevant school services; those who were aware rated their knowledge levels as low. Compared to their caucasian counterparts, african american parents reported less adhd awareness and lower self-rated knowledge. They experienced fewer cues to action, such as receiving adhd information from teachers or reading media accounts. Furthermore, they made more etiological attributions to sugar intake and expected less benefit from treatment.

Studies of women in the south asian diaspora suggest the vulnerability of married women in immigrant communities, compared to native women. The present study examines how women understand this link by examining their conceptual representations of the causal relationship between marriage roles, health and illness. Using qualitative methods and a model of illness representation from health psychology literature, 35 traditional south asian immigrant women living in new york city were interviewed. Results indicate that problems associated with marriage roles, including marital and affinal family conflict, domestic overwork and isolation were viewed as extremely serious and were associated conceptually with a variety of health problems. Two overlapping sociosomatic models of marital illness emerge in the findings. One model revolves around a semantic framework of ideas associated with pressure and tension that lead to illness, either mental or physical. The other model focuses on notions of weakness and deficiency. Women's sociosomatic models reveal a complex understanding of the role of social stress in illness. These models are shaped both by traditional humoral concepts and by modern biomedical models.

There is a lack of easily accessible, low-threshold treatments taking the cultural background into account. Culturally adapted cbt (ca cbt) is a well evaluated, transdiagnostic group intervention for refugees, using psychoeducation, meditation, and yoga-like exercises. Objective: an uncontrolled pilot study with male farsi-speaking refugees from afghanistan and iran was conducted to investigate feasibility with this ethnic group; a group for which no previous cbt trials have been reported. Method : the participants were nine farsi-speaking, male refugees with m.i.n.i./Dsm-iv diagnoses comprising ptsd, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Treatment components were adapted to the specific cultural framework of perception of symptoms, causes, ideas of healing, and local therapeutic processes. Before and after 12 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome was assessed using the general health questionnaire (ghq-28). Secondary outcome measures were the posttraumatic checklist, patient health questionnaire, somatic symptom scale, world health organization quality of life questionnaire (whoqol-bref), affective style questionnaire (asq), and emotion regulation scale (ers). Results : seven participants completed treatment. In the completer analysis, improvements were found on almost all questionnaires. Large effect sizes were seen for the ghq-28 ( d  = 2.0), whoqol-bref scales ( d  = 1.0-2.3), asq tolerating subscale ( d  = 2.2), and ers ( d  = 1.7). With respect to feasibility, cultural adaptation seemed to be a crucial means to promote effectiveness. Conclusion : ca cbt may reduce general psychopathological distress and improve quality of life. Improvement in emotion regulation strategies may mediate treatment effects. More support should be provided to enhance coping with the uncertainty of asylum status and stressful housing conditions. Ca cbt appears to be a promising transdiagnostic treatment, serving as an initial low-threshold therapy in a stepped care approach.; Competing interests: no potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,AFGHANISTAN;TRAUMATIZED REFUGEES;CULTURALLY ADAPTED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY;GROUP TREATMENT;TRANSDIAGNOSTIC TREATMENT;TRAUMA;• FEASIBILITY OF A TRANSDIAGNOSTIC CBT DEMONSTRATED FOR FARSI-SPEAKING REFUGEES. • CULTURAL ADAPTATION OF CBT FOR FARSI-SPEAKING REFUGEES IN RESPECT TO SYMPTOM PERCEPTION. • CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS;TREATMENT EXPECTATIONS;AND IDEAS OF HEALING. • GROUP SETTING INCREASES SOCIAL SUPPORT AND REDUCES ECONOMIC COST.;Pilot Projects,,

Outpatients with ibs (n = 64) or bowel symptoms explained by physical disease (n = 61) completed questionnaires to assess recollections of abuse as children or adults and current dissociation, somatization, and emotional distress. By comparison with physically diseased patients, patients with ibs recalled more sexual abuse as children and adults, more physical abuse as children, and more psychological abuse as adults. They were more anxious and depressed, and somatized and dissociated more. Analyses indicated a causal chain linking, in turn, abuse, dissociation, somatization, and ibs. The results are consistent with a model in which childhood abuse is linked to ibs because it causes a tendency to dissociate, and because dissociation causes a general increase in physical symptoms. Future research should identify factors that explain why a generally increased level of physical symptoms should, in some patients, lead specifically to ibs.

Three cases that reflect the ss' different ways of dealing and coping with aggression and related anxieties are presented: (1) ss claimed that they would never attack another but would resist the other if attacked (flexible handling, in accordance with educational pressures). (2) ss claimed that they would never participate in aggressive behavior even if attacked (highly negative cathexis of aggressivity). (3) ss admitted less frequently to receiving pleasure from initiating aggression (defective handling of aggression).

Evaluation results will be presented. A baseline survey was done before the campaign in nuremberg and wuerzburg (control region), two surveys followed 10 and 22 months after the implementation. Multiple regression analyses were performed, with time, place and the interaction of time and location as independent and the corresponding items as dependent variables. For the general population, the campaign was successful in creating awareness for the nad. For persons who reported experience with depression and persons aware of the nad, analyses showed positive desirable effects: more awareness of depression and the nad. In addition, among those aware, more positive attitudes towards medication treatment and antidepressants developed and also `lack of self-discipline' declined as causal explanation as did the notion `pull yourself together' as treatment option. The campaign induced relevant changes mainly in persons aware of the nad and persons who reported to have had experience with depression. The fact that many of the changes in the general population declined in the second year of the campaign, when activities were done with lower intensity, illustrates the need for permanent depression awareness action.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,NA,,

These individuals were asked about the reasons for their termination and responses were coded into thematic categories. Common reasons included work performance, social difficulties, attendance, and mental health challenges. Adults were more likely to attribute terminations to internal causes (related to the individual) than to external causes (environment-related).

The patterns vary by condition and age and at many ages, the health of women and men is more similar than is often assumed. However, we should not minimize the gender differences that do exist and in this paper we focus on three health problems which are more common among women: distress, migraine and arthritis/rheumatism. We consider to what extent work, household structure and social, personal and material resources explain these gender differences in health. Analysis of the distributions of paid work conditions, household circumstances and resources reveal mostly minor differences by gender and differences in exposure to these circumstances contribute little to understanding gender differences in health. There is also little evidence that greater vulnerability is a generalized health response of women to paid and household circumstances. We find limited evidence that social, personal and material resources are involved in pathways linking work and home circumstances to health in ways that differ between the sexes. In conclusion, we consider some reasons for the lack of support for our explanatory model: the measures available in the nphs data set which contains little information on the household itself; the difficulty of separating 'gender' from the social and material conditions of men's and women's lives; and changes in women's and men's roles which may have led to a narrowing of differences in health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,HEALTH STATUS INDICATORS*;SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS*;WOMEN'S HEALTH*;ADOLESCENT;ADULT;AGED;ARTHRITIS/EPIDEMIOLOGY;CANADA/EPIDEMIOLOGY;DEPRESSION/EPIDEMIOLOGY;EMPLOYMENT/ECONOMICS;EMPLOYMENT/PSYCHOLOGY;FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS/ETHNOLOGY;FEMALE;HUMANS;LONGITUDINAL STUDIES;MALE;MIDDLE AGED;MIGRAINE DISORDERS/EPIDEMIOLOGY;SEX FACTORS;SOCIAL SUPPORT;STRESS;PSYCHOLOGICAL/EPIDEMIOLOGY;Health Surveys,,

In the present study, attributions of self and partner were investigated as mediators of the association between depressive symptoms and relationship satisfaction. A student and community sample of 270 adults in heterosexual romantic relationships completed an online survey consisting of depressive symptom, relationship satisfaction, and relationship attribution inventories. Pearson's product-moment correlation and multiple regression analyses were utilized to assess meditational pathways. Depressive symptoms were significantly negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction. Self- and partner-attributions were significantly positively correlated with relationship satisfaction. Self- and partner-attributions did not mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and relationship satisfaction. Rather, results indicated that depressive symptoms and partner-attributions were significant predictors of relationship satisfaction, but self-attributions were not. Partner-attributions were found to partially mediate the depressive symptom-relationship satisfaction link for the student subsample.

The present study aimed to explore how psychosocial causal beliefs, stereotypes, and emotional reactions could affect professional help-seeking preferences. A representative community-based sample of taiwanese adults aged 20-65 (n = 800) was recruited by a random-digit-dialing computer-assisted telephone interviewing system. Participants were asked to describe their psychosocial causal beliefs, stereotypes, emotional reactions, and professional help-seeking preferences for a person with depression described in a case vignette. Serial mediation analyses were conducted to test the direct and indirect effects of psychosocial causal beliefs on professional help-seeking preferences. Psychosocial causal beliefs were positively associated with perceived dependency, which resulted in stronger pity and, in turn, increased help-seeking preferences for mental health professionals. Psychosocial causal beliefs were positively associated with perceived dependency, which resulted in stronger fear and, in turn, increased help-seeking preferences for other medical professionals (i.e., general practitioner, and chinese medical doctor). This study indicated that reducing negative emotions such as fear and increasing pity were likely to be useful in promoting public preferences to seek help from mental health professionals.

A Qualitative Study Of Problematic Smartphone Use Among Undergraduate Students,2021,1,1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION,,,,,YANG Z and ASBURY K and GRIFFITHS MD,,,,,"There is empirical evidence to suggest that problematic smartphone use (psu) is associated with mental health problems including anxiety in educational settings. This qualitative study explored attitudes towards-and self-reported impacts of-smartphone use among british young adult students, as well as perceived causes of psu. Free-response written accounts were gathered from 265 british undergraduates at an english university. Open-ended questions were asked about their attitudes towards smartphone use, their reasons for using their smartphones, and what they perceived as the consequences of their smartphone use. Narratives were analyzed using framework analysis and a thematic framework was identified. The three main consequences of psu described by participants were (1) uncontrolled frequent checking of smartphones, (2) using smartphones late at night, and irrelevant use of smartphones in class. The main reported explanations for psu were fear of missing messages, boredom in class, poor self-regulation, and external reasons (e.g., boring lectures). Smartphone use was reported to have both positive and negative impacts on young adults' life satisfaction, social relationships, physical health, and study. Many participants reported that they need to develop better self-regulation to address their psu. Findings suggest that smartphone use can have benefits as well as potentially causing harm among university students. Psu can-in some cases-be understood as reflecting mental well-being issues, poor self-regulation, and social problems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,STUDENT SMARTPHONE USE;PROBLEMATIC SMARTPHONE USE;SMARTPHONE;ADDICTION;PERCEPTIONS OF SMARTPHONE USE;Adolescent;Neoplasms,,

Qol is associated with physical and psychosocial symptoms and with patients' illness perceptions (ips). Ips are modifiable cognitive constructs developed to make sense of one's illness. It is unclear how ips influence patients' qol. A better understanding of this relationship can inform and direct high quality care aimed at improving patients' qol. We therefore investigated the mediating role of anxiety and depression in the association of ips with qol.; Methods: data from 377 patients with advanced cancer were used from the profiles registry. Patients completed measures on ips (bipq), qol (eortc qlq-c30), and symptoms of anxiety and depression (hads). Mediation analyses were conducted to decompose the total effect of ips on qol into a direct effect and indirect effect.; Results: all ips but one (""comprehensibility"") were negatively associated with qol (p<0.001); patients with more negative ips tended to have worse qol. The effect was strongest for patients who felt that their illness affected their life more severely (""consequences""), patients who were more concerned about their illness (""concern""), and patients who thought that their illness strongly affected them emotionally (""emotions""). Anxiety mediated 41-87% and depression mediated 39-69% of the total effect of patients' ips on qol.; Conclusion: negative ips are associated with worse qol. Anxiety and depression mediate this association. Targeting symptoms of anxiety and depression, through the modification of ips, has the potential to improve qol of patients with advanced cancer.

Many of the individuals with mental illness suffer from excessive anxiety, as over 25\% of americans experience an anxiety disorder during their lifetime and most of these individuals remain untreated. Building from the premise that recognizing one's symptoms precedes requests for help, the current paper presents data from 577 adults (50\% caucasian, 50\% african american) in the us regarding their ability to recognize anxiety disorders. Findings from a national survey showed that when presented with detailed vignettes portraying symptoms and their impact, 50\% of respondents correctly recognized depression, whereas less than 20\% correctly recognized the anxiety disorders. Recognition that the symptoms were a cause for concern was much more common, with 75\% or more of the sample noting concern. Responses were surprisingly similar across the two races, and few consistent moderators were found. In conclusion, increasing recognition of anxiety disorders may be a useful first step toward increasing service utilization. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

A narrative review of studies on mental health literacy in singapore covering the period from 1995 to 2016 highlights the findings from various local studies about attitudes toward mental illness, belief about the causes, and help-seeking behavior. Findings revealed that many lay people are unable to recognize different types of mental disorders. Negative attitudes toward mental illness that hinders individuals from seeking professional treatment, and help-seeking, are the common themes that emerge from the findings. Health professionals have differing views about the causes and treatment of mental disorders. Findings also revealed that treatment seeking and attitudes and beliefs toward mental illness are related to mental health literacy. Implications for promoting mental health literacy are provided.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,BELIEFS ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS;MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY;MENTAL ILLNESS;;SINGAPORE;Singapore,,

Subjects: 20 patients and 20 control subjects matched with age, education level, and genre. Methods: apathy was assessed by the apathy evaluation scale (aes) and by a specific scale including a quantitative evaluation of 32 intentional activities and a qualitative assessment of the causes of attribution of restricted activities by a semi-structured interview (gdas). Four causal attributions were distinguished: e = related to external factors, m = disease symptoms related, c = affective disturbances with preservation of motivation, and d = demotivation. The results were compared to a battery of tests including cognitive evaluation (mini-mental state and mattis dementia rating scale for global evaluation, selecting reminding test for memory; stroop test for inhibition, and six element test for planification); affective evaluation (montgomery \& asberg and hamilton depression rating scales for depression, emotional disturbances by the abrams and taylor scale, the depression mood scale, and the international picture system), premorbid personality (neopi-r), and defensive psychological mechanisms (dsq-40); functional assessment by a combined scale including the self-maintenance physical scale and the instrumental acitivities of daily living (lawton) and the social activities scale (katz \& lyerly), the disability assessment scale, and the updrs. Results: apathy was found in 25\% of the patients according to the aes, but only in 15\% according to the gdas. Scores on cognitive and affective evaluation were higher in patients than in controls but only emotional blunting was correlated to apathy. Some results coud be interpreted in favor of a premorbid personality disorder in patients with pd, but were not correlated to apathy. Causal attribution was m in 38\% of cases of reduced activities, d in 30\%, e in 22\%, and c in 10\%. Conclusion: emotional blunting was the main correlate of apathy in pd patients without dementia and depression.

However, the extent to which illness-related perceptions are associated with depressive symptom severity among poc with intractable seizures is unclear. Method: this cross-sectional study examined relationships among illness representations and self-rated depressive symptoms in 55 pwe (m age = 41; 61.8\% female) with intractable seizures (m seizures per month = 2) who identified as black/african-american (52.7\%), black/caribbean-american (27.3\%), and/or hispanic/latino (21.8\%). Epilepsy-related illness perceptions were assessed with the illness perception questionnaire-revised and depression was measured via the neurological disorders depression inventory for epilepsy (nddi-e). Results: nearly half of the sample (41.8\%) scored above the nddi-e depression cut-off. Pwe endorsing more severe depressive symptoms indicated that their epilepsy had more negative consequences, was hard to comprehend, was insufficiently controlled by treatment, and had a negative emotional impact (p's <= 0.02). Controlling for sex, these four illness representations accounted for 48\% of the variance in depression severity. Interestingly, participants with probable major depressive episodes were more likely to endorse several psychological causes of seizures compared to non-depressed pwe. Conclusions: worse depression symptom severity was associated with negative illness perceptions and a tendency to attribute one's epilepsy to psychological causes. Future research is needed to understand how the relationship between negative illness perceptions and depression symptoms unfold over time and whether interventions aimed at modifying illness representations reduce psychological distress in diverse pwe.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS;COMMON SENSE MODEL OF ILLNESS;EPILEPSY;;DEPRESSION;AFRICAN-AMERICAN;CARIBBEAN-AMERICAN;HISPANIC;LATINO;Epilepsy;African Americans;Caribbean Region,,

We argue that diabetes figures both as an expression and a product of social suffering in these narratives.

To date, no studies have yet examined this relationship among adolescents. Using a sample of arab adolescents, the purpose of this study was to describe adolescents' beliefs about the etiology of depression, and examine whether these beliefs influence the type and severity of depression stigma. Methodsresultsa nationwide school survey was conducted in a representative sample of jordanian public and private schools located in jordan, a middle-eastern arab country. A total of 2,349 adolescents aged 12-17 (59\% female) completed and returned an anonymous survey that included measures on adolescents' sociodemographic and health characteristics, depression symptoms, depression stigma, and depression etiological beliefs. An exploratory factor analysis with principal components analysis (pca) was used to examine the factor structure of the depression etiological beliefs scale. The stability of the pca findings was tested using a cross-validation method. Regression analyses were performed to examine whether depression etiological beliefs, depression severity, or their interaction are associated with depression stigma. Adolescents endorsed multiple etiological beliefs about depression. The beliefs in which likely or very likely was most often reported were stressful events in one's life (72\%), social factors (65\%), and one's weak will (56\%). On the other hand, the least reported beliefs were genetic or inherited problems (24\%), chemical imbalance (30\%), and punishment for wrong doings (35\%). The interaction between adolescents' depression severity and depression beliefs significantly predicted personal stigma. Adolescent sex, age, and region of residence significantly affected the relationship between depression beliefs and stigma. Conclusionsnurses need to consider the beliefs and attitudes their patients have around depression, as these can influence symptom severity, comprehensive treatment plans, and adherence to provider recommendations. This study provides a better understanding of how depression beliefs affect jordanian adolescents' attitudes toward depression, which can guide intervention programs to increase awareness about depression and promote treatment utilization.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION;ARAB;DEPRESSION ETIOLOGY;JORDAN;STIGMA;SURVEY;Adolescent;Arabs,,

It addresses the psychiatric epidemiological puzzle that indicates african-caribbeans in england have significantly greater rates of schizophrenia than the general british population. Based on two years of ethnographic fieldwork with patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, their relatives, and community members in north london, the researcher argued that specific social changes and historical forces interlink to create a toxic environment characterized by negative expressed emotions and social defeat to affect african-caribbeans' mental health. The dissertation is organized into five chapters that examine specific sociocultural risk factors. These include social inequalities, social fragmentation, rapid social changes, isolation, and community expressed emotions. The first chapter argues that notwithstanding the conceptual and diagnostic limitations of schizophrenia, epidemiological studies provide compelling evidence for the elevated rates of the illness in this group. Chapter two sets out a sociohistorical framework for understanding the relationship between social inequalities, disparities, and schizophrenia. The third chapter examines the role of community fragmentation in psychosis; it explores the community's anxieties about the perceived loss of their caribbean culture and identity, their level of social capital, and their integration into british society. Chapter four focuses on the emotional worlds of african-caribbeans and offers a concept of community expressed emotions (cee) to explore their experiences of specific negative emotions such as experiences of hostility and isolation, and their interface with risks of schizophrenia. The fifth chapter analyzes the community's collective response to the mental health crisis and examines the ways racial identity and slave history are mobilized in african-caribbeans' explanatory models for schizophrenia. The conclusion explains how these various risk factors interact to create a toxic social environment that induces risks of schizophrenia. The analysis builds on psychological and anthropological theories of the self to link individual vulnerabilities to schizophrenia to larger social processes.

Study 2 used data from 546 (50% female) seventh and eighth grade students at two time points: january and may within the same year. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that eas indirectly predicted depression. Cross-sectional and prospective analyses indicated that stable attributions, in particular, were associated with lower levels of depression through higher levels of hope. Notably, contrary to expectations, global attributions consistently predicted higher levels of depression. Results suggest that hope mediates the association between attributional stability for positive events and reductions in depression over time.

But to guide empirical research, a theory of the psychopath’s mind is also important. One such theory of mind is the psychoanalytic. Contemporary psychoanalytic theorists offer an explanatory model of the psychopath’s personality, which encompasses the dynamic nature of his mind and its developmental origins. Such a model needs to take into account attitudes and behaviours that may appear to be antithetical to human nature—the lack of empathy and emotional attachment, the inversion of moral values, the addiction to violence, cruelty and extreme states of excitement, the triumphant manipulation and deception of others, and the stance of arrogance, grandiosity and omnipotence.

It was further hypothesized that socioeconomic status (ses) groups would differ in problem identification, due to differences in their norms and causal attribution biases. Attributions of causality for alcohol use and inferences of an alcohol problem were examined in socioeconomically different communities that differed in their social norms for alcohol consumption. For all respondents problem identification required that alcohol use be attributed to causes internal to the person. However, the lower ses sample was generally biased toward attributing alcohol use to external causes, in contrast to an ""internal"" bias among higher ses respondents. The latter were also more sensitive to norm violations in their problem identification. These differences led higher ses respondents to more readily identify an alcohol problem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,ATTITUDE*;SOCIAL VALUES*;SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS*;ALCOHOLISM/*DIAGNOSIS;ADULT;ALCOHOL DRINKING;ALCOHOLISM/PSYCHOLOGY;HUMANS;MALE;SOCIAL CLASS;Alcoholics;Causality,,

Refugees with mental health difficulties present particular therapeutic challenges that include complex trauma, different cultural traditions, and ongoing stress. The current chapter outlines how a contextually sensitive cbt can be developed for such refugee groups. It outlines key dimensions of culturally sensitive cbt, which can be therapeutically implemented among refugees in order to maximize efficacy and effectiveness. These guidelines can be followed to design culturally sensitive cbt studies among refugees, or what might be called 'contextually sensitive cbt,' and the guidelines can be used to evaluate such studies. Some examples of these key dimensions of care are the following: assessing and addressing key local complaints (e.g., somatic symptoms, spirit possession, and syndromes like 'thinking a lot'); incorporating into treatment key local sources of recovery and resilience (e.g., cbt-compatible proverbs and techniques in that culture). Another example of a key dimension of care is making cbt techniques more tolerable and effective for the cultural group through various means: by using a phased approach, by utilizing culturally appropriate framing of cbt techniques (using local analogies), by making positive reassociations to problematic sensations during interoceptive exposure (e.g., to traditional games), and by using trauma-type exposure as an opportunity to practice emotion regulation. We describe such concepts as explanatory model bridging, cultural grounding, and contextual sensitivity.

Both propositions are criticized on the basis that szasz' logical criticism of the mental illness concept focuses upon a use of the concept which in fact is never regarded as 'explanatory.' He also ignores a context in which its use is informative.

Participants were followed for 1 month for delayed symptom resolution, defined as =3 symptoms that were new/worse than preinjury symptoms measured by the use of graded symptom inventory. Preinjury psychological traits were measured by parental report on subscales of the personality inventory for children-2 (maladjustment, cognitive abilities, somatization). Child report of postinjury anxiety and injury perception were measured with the state-trait anxiety inventory for children and children's illness perception questionnaire. Psychological instrument scores were compared between those with and without delayed symptom resolution via a kruskal-wallis test. Associations between psychological traits and delayed symptom resolution were investigated by the use of logistic regression.; Results: delayed symptom resolution occurred in 21% of participants. Score distributions were significantly worse on the state-trait anxiety inventory for children (38 [iqr 33-40] vs 35 [iqr 31-39]; p = .04) and somatization subscale (1 [iqr 0-3] vs 1 [iqr 0-1]; p = .01) among children with delayed symptom resolution compared with children with early symptom resolution. Somatization was associated with delayed symptom resolution (aor 1.35, 95% ci 1.08-1.69). The proportion of children with abnormal somatization scores was significantly greater in the delayed symptom resolution group (34.2%) than the early symptom resolution group (12.8%; p < .01). Other psychological measures were not different between groups.; Conclusion: somatization is associated with delayed symptom resolution in this cohort of children with concussion. Postconcussive symptoms lasting at least 1 month may warrant referral to a neuropsychologist familiar with postconcussion care. (Copyright © 2016 elsevier inc.

A consecutive sample of 1036 (response rate, 86.1 \%, mean age 55.18 years, 60 \% female) survivors of different cancers recruited within 6 months of completion of adjuvant therapy from hong kong public hospitals completed the brief illness perception questionnaire (b-ipq), chinese version of the memorial symptom assessment scale short-form (msas-sf), and the revised chinese version of life orientation test (c-lot-r), respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analyses examined adjusted associations. Ipq seriousness, symptom identity, illness concern, and emotional impact scores varied by cancer type (p < 0.01). Stress-related, lifestyle, environment, psychological/personality, and health-related factors were most frequently attributed causes of cancer. After adjustment for sample differences, physical symptom distress was significantly associated with all illness perception dimensions (p < 0.01), excepting control beliefs. Optimism was positively correlated with perceived personal and treatment control (p < 0.01) and illness understanding (p < 0.01), but negatively correlated with other ipq dimensions (all p < 0.01). Ipq domain differences by cancer type were eliminated by adjustment for sample characteristics. Illness perceptions did not differ by cancer type. Greater physical symptom distress and lower levels of optimism were associated with more negative illness perceptions. Understanding how cancer survivors make sense of cancer can clarify an important aspect of adaptation. This in turn can inform interventions to facilitate adjustment. Knowledge contributions include evidence of physical symptom distress correlating with most dimensions of illness perception. Optimism was also associated with cancer survivors' illness perceptions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS;SYMPTOM DISTRESS;OPTIMISM;CANCER SURVIVORS;;CHINESE,,

Generally, biogenetic causal attributions were not associated with more tolerant attitudes; they were related to stronger rejection in most studies examining schizophrenia. No published study reported on associations of biogenetic causal attributions and perceived responsibility. The stereotype of self-responsibility was unrelated to rejection in most studies.

However, their importance in parenting interventions remains unknown as research has not addressed whether parental attributions predict outcomes associated with parenting training. The current study examined whether problematic pre-treatment and change resistant parental attributions during treatment uniquely predict child behaviour outcomes. Method: participants were 250 families with children aged from 3 to 16 referred to specialist clinics for the treatment of conduct problems. Measures of family demographic information, parental attributions, and severity of child conduct problems were collected as part of pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up assessments. Results: linear regression showed that mothers' pre-treatment parental attributions uniquely predicted severity of conduct problems at the post-treatment and 3-month follow-up assessments. Fathers' pre-treatment parental attributions uniquely predicted severity of conduct problems at the 3-month follow-up assessment. Reductions in problematic pre-treatment parental attributions were recorded at post-treatment for both parents. However, smaller reductions or increases in mothers’ problematic attributions uniquely predicted worse child behaviour outcomes, a result not replicated for fathers. Conclusions: findings that pre-treatment and change resistant parental attributions predict poorer child behaviour outcomes after controlling for other predictors and treatment effects recommend that parental attributions should be assessed prior to and after treatment and possibly included in treatment to maximise treatment gains for children with conduct problems.

Objective: to investigate the relationship between depression-related attribution styles and perceived pain intensity (ppi) after controllable versus uncontrollable electrical skin stimulation in healthy male individuals. Methods: causal attributions for negative events were measured using the attribution style questionnaire (asq) on the dimensions internal versus external (int), global versus specific (glo) and stable versus unstable (sta) in 50 men (20 to 31 years of age). Additionally, symptoms of anxiety and depression (measured using the depression scale) as well as baseline helplessness were assessed. Participants were randomly assigned to receive self-administered (controllable) or experimenter-administered (uncontrollable) painful skin stimuli. Ppi was assessed after stress exposure using a visual analogue scale (0 to 100). Relationships between ppi and depression-related cognitions were calculated using correlation and multiple regression analyses. Results: correlation analyses revealed a moderate correlation between ppi and asq-int scores (r=0.46). Following uncontrollable stress exposure, significantly higher ppi ratings (p=0.001) and a higher correlation between ppi and asq-int (r=0.70) were observed. Multiple regression analysis showed an independent influence of stressor controllability (beta=0.39; p=0.003) and asq-int (beta=0.36; p=0.006) on ppi. Discussion: these findings highlight the interaction of specific depression-related cognitions and stress controllability on pain intensity perception.

In the clinical setting, the individual patient's acceptance or rejection of prescribed pharmacological regimens is often the single greatest determinant of these treatments' effectiveness. For this reason, an understanding of factors that impede and promote patient collaboration with prescribed acute and maintenance treatment should inform both pharmacological and psychosocial treatment planning. We review the substantive literature on medication adherence in schizophrenia and describe a modified health belief model within which empirical findings can be understood. In addition to factors intrinsic to schizophrenia psychopathology, medication-related factors, available social support, substance abuse comorbidity, and the quality of the therapeutic alliance each affect adherence and offer potential points of intervention to improve the likelihood of collaboration. Because noncompliance as a clinical problem is multidetermined, an individualized approach to assessment and treatment, which is often best developed in the context of an ongoing physician-patient relationship, is optimal. The differential diagnosis of noncompliance should lead to interventions that target specific causal factors thought to be operative in the individual patient.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Schizophrenia,,

This approach must also include an understanding of phase-oriented trauma treatment, which begins with safety, symptom reduction and stabilization. Fortifying refugee resilience with an emphasis on current functioning and settlement needs, and avoiding an overly medicalized approach to those who have experienced psychological trauma and torture is recommended.

Treatments of severe caloric restrictions and educational interventions have had minimal sustained effects on weight loss.

Methods: relationships based on baker and brownell's model of exercise, self-appraisal, mood change, and weight loss were tested with obese (body mass index >= 30) women initiating a supported exercise and nutrition information program over 6 months. Results: exercise participation was associated with significant improvements in mood, body image, and exercise-related self-efficacy. When changes on measures of these factors were simultaneously entered into a multiple regression equation, a significant portion of the variance in exercise session attendance was accounted for (r-2 = 0.26, f(7, 52) = 2.57, p < 0.05), with changes in tension (beta = -0.34) and physical self-concept (beta = 0.33) making significant unique contributions. Exercise session attendance was significantly correlated with weight and body composition changes (r = -0.30 to -0.47). The indirect effect of exercise on weight loss was estimated at 0.23. As hypothesized, less improvement in depression was significantly associated with less improvement in weight and body composition (r values = 0.23 to 0.29). Conclusions: physical activity and exercise may have positive effects on sustained weight loss due to associated changes in self-appraisal and mood factors. Early incorporation of moderate exercise into weight management treatments may have considerable value beyond just energy expenditure.

As expected, attributional style predicted maintenance of depressive reactions to perceived exam outcome through the operation of coping strategy selection in the perceived exam failure condition but not in the perceived exam non-failure condition. Also as expected, attributional style did not predict immediate depressive reactions to perceived exam outcome after accounting for the role of perceived exam outcome.

Although depression is a major public health problem, little is known about lay people's views of this subject in iran. The aim of this study was to explore how depression in women is viewed among lay people in three major ethnic groups - kurd, turk, and fars. Design. Participants were selected from public urban healthcare centers. Four focus group discussions were conducted for each of the three ethnic groups and classified by level of education from three locations, in the capital city (tehran), west (ilam), and the northwest (tabriz) of iran. Twelve focus groups; 38 men and 38 women have been conducted by using a case vignette describing a woman with major depression. Results. Depression symptoms were perceived as a temporary phenomenon. It was regarded as a colloquial term for feeling blue, mostly related to external stressors (social model). The common terms used in all ethnic groups were depression, and nerve/soul distress. Environmental cause and war were considered as external causes of the symptoms, and emotional factors, cognition distortion, and biological reasons, as internal factors. The participants believed it was necessary to seek help from religion, family and friends, positive thinking, and distraction from social problems, besides consultations with psychologists as counselors. Medication was often seen as the last resort. Stigma was mentioned as an important factor that makes people avoid visiting psychiatrists. Conclusion. These data may have implications for mental healthcare practice, especially for the approach to diagnosis of depression. Moreover, there is a need for developing and integrating gender-relevant and cultural indicators in the existing national mental health systems in iran.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,DEPRESSION;LAY PEOPLE;EXPLANATORY MODEL;ETHNIC GROUPS;WOMEN;CASE;VIGNETTE;Ethnic Groups,,

The current experiment tested the effect of negative content (criticism) and negative tone (hostile) of the feedback on children’s affect, self-evaluations, and attributions. We also explored whether maternal history of depression and children’s temperament moderated these relations. Participants were 152 mothers and children (48% girls) aged 4 and 5 years (m = 61.6 months, sd = 6.83). The task involved three scenarios enacted by dolls; a child doll made something (e.g., picture, house, numbers) that had a mistake (e.g., no windows on the house) and proudly showed it to the mother doll, who then gave feedback (standardized, audio recorded) to the child. Children were randomized to one of four maternal feedback conditions: negative or neutral content in either a negative or neutral tone. Negative content (criticism) produced significantly more negative affect and lower self-evaluations than neutral content. When the tone of the feedback was hostile, children of mothers who had been depressed during the children’s lifetimes were significantly more likely to make internal attributions for mistakes than children of nondepressed mothers. In addition, among children with low temperamental negative affectivity, in the presence of negative tone, negative content significantly predicted more internal attributions for the errors. Findings are discussed in terms of understanding the role of evaluative feedback in children’s emerging social cognitions and affect.

The intervention mapping framework was used to develop a web-based program called vascular view. The vascular view program contained 6 modules (coping with cvd, setting boundaries, lifestyle, healthy nutrition, being physically active, interaction with health professionals) aiming to increase self-management behavior by tailoring to the perceived problems and (support) needs of patients after cvd. Objective: the aim was to test the effectiveness of vascular view before embarking on a full-scale randomized clinical trial (rct) by evaluating the potential effectiveness and effect sizes of the vascular view program and identifying outcome measures most likely to capture the potential benefits. Methods: an explorative rct was performed. Both control and intervention groups received care as usual and, in addition, the intervention group received 12 months of access to a web-based self-management program. Assessment occurred at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Outcome measures included general patient-reported outcome measurements: illness perception questionnaire (ipq), rand-36, patient activation measure, and patient self-efficacy. Module-specific patient-reported outcome measurements were beliefs about medicines questionnaire, international physical activity questionnaire, dutch healthy diet index, fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (ftnd), alcohol use disorders identification test, and perceived efficacy in patient-physician interaction. Linear mixed models for repeated measures using intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis were applied to study differences between the patients in the intervention and control groups. Floor and ceiling effects were explored to give insight into the outcome measures most likely to capture the potential benefits. Results: a total of 105 patients in the control group and 103 patients in the intervention group participated in the study. A positive direction of change between baseline and 12 months was shown for most outcome measurements in favor of the intervention group, of which 2 out of 10 outcomes showed a significant effect: attribution of cause of the disease to risk factors and immunity factors (ipq) and dependency of nicotine (ftnd). Floor and ceiling effects were seen in the ipq, rand-36, and the self-efficacy questionnaire. Conclusions: no conclusion for the efficacy of the vascular view program or selection of outcome measurements can be taken yet. A process evaluation will be conducted to gain thorough insight into the working elements of the program, patient needs in ehealth, and the use of the program by patients. This can determine for whom web-based self-management programs will work and help to adapt the program.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,EXPLORATIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL;CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES;;SELF-MANAGEMENT;EHEALTH SUPPORT PROGRAMS;INTERNET;LIFESTYLE;NURSING;Cardiovascular Diseases,,

Research suggests that such explanations provokes mixed blessings: biological explanations may reduce blame but also encourage prognostic pessimism and promote perceptions of pharmacological treatment over psychotherapy. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of different causal explanations on social anxiety disorder. Method: about 205 adults completed an experiment where they read a vignette describing an individual with social anxiety disorder and were randomly assigned to a symptom explanation that was: (1) biological, (2) biopsychosocial, (3) psychosocial, or (4) no explanation. Results: the psychosocial condition yielded the highest perceived credibility and lowest attributions of blame. The biological condition promoted positive expectations for medication effectiveness compared to other conditions. Conditions did not differ on prognostic expectations.

The data include 1138 israeli elderly (70+) respondents. The results indicate that most of the elderly want to prolong their life in mild health conditions, including having cancer with a relatively good prognosis, while only a small percentage want lst in severe illness. Structural equation analysis (lisrel) of wishes for lst in severe illness conditions revealed that personal experience with other people's illnesses is the single most powerful explanatory factor affecting choice regarding lst directly and indirectly, channeled through fear of death and fear of dying. The results of such experiences whether positive or negative affect wishes for lst in the same direction; however, since they are mostly negative, past experience mostly weakens the will to prolong life by lst. Beliefs and feelings regarding life and death, such as fear of death, fear of dying, the will to live and religiosity, are also good predictors of wishes for lst. Those who fear death, have a strong will to live, and those who are more religious are more likely than others to want to prolong their life by lst, while those who fear dying want it less. Religiosity affects these wishes directly and indirectly through fear of death, fear of dying, and the will to live. Health status and social support have only a minor effect on wishes for lst: the higher the present quality of life, the more likely are the elderly to want lst. Most of the socio-demographic characteristics have no significant effect on elderly persons' wishes for lst. Only gender has a minor direct and indirect effect, channeled through the fear of dying and the will to live. Women in comparison to men want less lst because they fear dying more and have a weaker will to live. The results of this study shed some light on the explanatory factors of wishes for lst in severe illness conditions. More research is needed in order to promote social understanding of the concerns and wishes of the most relevant parties regarding the use of lst. This is a necessary condition for the formulation of new societal guidelines for general policy and daily behavior.

Specifically, knowledge of alzheimer's disease, attribution of problem behaviors, perceived social support, and physical health, were assessed and their relationship to depression, positive and negative emotional experience, happiness and emotional control were explored. Greater knowledge of alzheimer's disease related directly to the more frequent experience of sadness, negative emotions and fear in caregivers, while attribution of problem behaviors to the disease was associated with increased happiness. African american caregivers experienced significantly more positive affect and significantly less negative affect than caucasians. The two groups did not vary, however, in depression, happiness or emotional control. Findings from this study suggest that african american caregivers may adjust to caregiving better than their caucasian counterparts and raise questions about the role of knowledge about alzheimer's disease and attribution of problem behaviors in caregiver adjustment.

Both, st and dbt, have their roots in cognitive behavioral therapy and aim at helping patient to deal with emotional dysregulation. However, there are major differences in the terminology, explanatory models and techniques used in the both methods. This article gives an overview of the major therapeutic techniques used in st and dbt with respect to emotion regulation and systematically puts them in the context of james gross' process model of emotion regulation. Similarities and differences of the two methods are highlighted and illustrated with a case example. A core difference of the two approaches is that dbt directly focusses on the acquisition of emotion regulation skills, whereas st does seldom address emotion regulation directly. All dbt-modules (mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness) are intended to improve emotion regulation skills and patients are encouraged to train these skills on a regular basis. Dbt assumes that improved skills and skills use will result in better emotion regulation. In st problems in emotion regulation are seen as a consequence of adverse early experiences (e.g., lack of safe attachment, childhood abuse or emotional neglect). These negative experiences have led to unprocessed psychological traumas and fear of emotions and result in attempts to avoid emotions and dysfunctional meta-cognitive schemas about the meaning of emotions. St assumes that when these underlying problems are addressed, emotion regulation improves. Major st techniques for trauma processing, emotional avoidance and dysregulation are limited reparenting, empathic confrontation and experiential techniques like chair dialogs and imagery rescripting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,"EMOTION REGULATION;EMOTIONAL AVOIDANCE;SCHEMA THERAPY;DIALECTICAL;BEHAVIOR THERAPY;EXPERIENTIAL TECHNIQUES;SKILLS;Behavior Therapy;Emotions;Social Control, Informal;Social Control, Formal",,

We included original research describing experiences of spiritual distress among adult patients or family members within inpatient settings and instrument validation studies. Each study was screened in duplicate for inclusion, and the data from included articles were extracted. Themes were identified, and data were synthesized.; Results: within the 37 articles meeting inclusion criteria, we identified six themes: conceptualizing spiritual distress (n = 2), diagnosis and prevalence (n = 7), assessment instrument development (n = 5), experiences (n = 12), associated variables (n = 12), and barriers and facilitators to clinical support (n = 5). The majority of studies focused on patients; two studies focused on family caregivers. The most common clinical settings were oncology (n = 19) and advanced disease (n = 19). Terminology to describe spiritual distress varied among studies. The prevalence of at least moderate spiritual distress in patients was 10%-63%. Spiritual distress was experienced in relation to self and others. Associated variables included demographic, physical, cognitive, and psychological factors. Barriers and facilitators were described.; Conclusion: patients' and families' experiences of spiritual distress in the inpatient setting are multifaceted. Important gaps in the literature include a narrow spectrum of populations, limited consideration of family caregivers, and inconsistent terminology. Research addressing these gaps may improve conceptual clarity and help clinicians better identify spiritual distress. (Copyright © 2018 american academy of hospice and palliative medicine.

It is assumed that it is harder for migrant clients to benefit from existing mhc provisions because of differing explanatory models with respect to mental illness. In this study a sample of 49 surinam, 60 turkish, 71 moroccan and 65 dutch clients of an amsterdam outpatient mhc facility was analyzed. Within the sample a problem group was specified. Respondents in this group persisted in using non-psychological explanatory models. The problem group was compared to the other respondents on several sociodemographic characteristics, acculturation levels, dsm-iv classification, and content of explanatory model. Migrants were overrepresented in the problem group. Furthermore, the educational level of respondents in the problem group was lower and somatic explanatory models were used less. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that educational level and an interaction or social content of the explanatory model were significant determinants of persistent use of non-psychological explanatory models. Ethnicity was not a significant determinant. These results suggest that mhc professionals should be aware that educational level and specific content of the explanatory model might be more important than ethnicity and culture in counseling success.

We propose social production function theory as a framework to resolve them. Social production function (spf) theory integrates strengths of relevant psychological theories and economic consumer/household production theories, without their limitations (namely, tradeoffs between satisfaction of different needs are not in the first, and goals or needs are not in the second). Spf theory identifies two ultimate goals that all humans seek to optimize (physical well-being and social well-being) and five instrumental goals by which they are achieved (stimulation, comfort, status, behavioural confirmation, affection). The core notion of spf theory is that people choose and substitute instrumental goals so as to optimize the production of their well-being, subject to constraints in available means of production. Spf theory guides research measurement and explanatory models, and it integrates features of contemporary subjective well-being theories.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

The 2 resulting groups, and a nonclinical control group, were administered a battery of attributional measures, and their attributional responses were coded by both the ss themselves and a pair of independent raters. The results show evidence of a self-serving bias for ss with persecutory delusions; however, this bias was not unique to those with persecutory delusions, and it disappeared when independent raters evaluated ss' causal statements on a reliable measure of attributional style. Ss with persecutory delusions tended to show a stronger bias toward blaming others rather than situations for negative outcomes, and there was a linear association between persecutory ideation and a self-serving attributional style. Finally, there were significant discrepancies between the attributional ratings of the persecutory-deluded subjects and those of independent judges. Implications for future research are discussed.

Attributions play an important role in depression and paranoia. However, contrary to most attributional models of psychopathology, there is evidence that attributional style is not a stable trait but is affected by recent experiences. Method. Paranoid, depressed, and healthy participants were exposed to a mild stressor in the form of the requirement to complete an anagram task, which included insoluble items. Before and afterwards, they completed measures of attributional style for negative events and a contingency judgment task. Results. Replicating previous findings, paranoid patients initially showed low internality scores for negative events and high judgments of control on the contingency judgment task, whereas the depressed participants showed high internality for negative events and low judgments of control. Following the anagram task, both clinical groups showed increased internality for hypothetical negative events. The paranoid participants also gave increased estimates of control on the contingency judgment task. Conclusions. Attributional style is more labile in paranoid and depressed patients than in healthy individuals.

Self-efficacy was significantly enhanced as a result of treatment, although it was not significantly related to weight loss during treatment. However, changes in efficacy expectations during follow-up did coincide with weight change during those intervals. In addition, efficacy expectations alone at treatment termination were found to be a significant predictor of weight loss following a 6-wk and 6-mo follow-up. Success–failure attributions contributed significantly to the prediction of efficacy expectations during treatment and during the 6-wk follow-up. Weight loss during treatment was not a significant determinant of treatment-induced self-efficacy enhancement.

The stigma scores exhibited significant negative correlation with age (r=-0.169, p=.034) but positive correlations with the scores of madrs (r=.212, p=.007), total scores (r=.273, p=.001) and subscales of interpersonal sensitivity (r=.233, p=.003), depression (r=.336, p<.001), and anxiety (r=.228, p=.004) of scl-90, scores of fss (r=.230, p=.004), and sds (r=.254, p=.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that depression subscale of scl-90 and fss were independently correlated with stigma. Conclusionthe age, employment status, fatigue, and depressive severity are closely associated with the perceived stigma of mdd patients and may be important factors considered for stigma interventions of mdd in china.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,"EMIC;MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER;STIGMA;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder",,

The aim of this study was to examine predictors of carers' distress and caregiving appraisals using a model of caregiving adapted from the previous literature.; Design: a cross-sectional design was used.; Methods: a sample of 115 individuals currently caring for someone with an ed participated in the study. Carers completed self-report assessments of psychological distress (ghq-12; goldberg & williams, 1988), experience of caregiving (szmukler et al., 1996), illness representations (ipq-scv; barrowclough, lobban, hatton, & quinn, 2001) and caregiving needs (canam; haigh & treasure, 2003). Simple and multiple hierarchical regressions were conducted.; Results: approximately 36% (39/109) of carers had scores on the ghq which indicated mental health difficulties, with 17% (19/109) experiencing high psychological distress. A negative experience of caregiving was associated with carers' distress. The dependency of the individual with the ed and stigma associated with the illness were most highly predictive of carers' distress. Shorter illness duration, higher levels of needs (lower levels of support) and perceptions of high illness consequences contributed to greater negative caregiving appraisals. The belief that the illness was attributable to the sufferers' personality was related to fewer positive appraisals.; Conclusions: adjusting to the impact of a family member experiencing an ed is problematic, as suggested by the relationship between shorter illness duration and greater negative appraisals of caregiving. Interventions to help reduce dependency and alleviate stigma may help to decrease carers' distress.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,ATTITUDE TO HEALTH*;FEEDING AND EATING DISORDERS*;CAREGIVERS/*PSYCHOLOGY;STRESS;PSYCHOLOGICAL/*ETIOLOGY;ADULT;CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES;FEMALE;HUMANS;MALE;MIDDLE AGED;MODELS;PSYCHOLOGICAL;MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS;NEEDS ASSESSMENT;REGRESSION ANALYSIS;RISK FACTORS;PSYCHOLOGICAL/PREVENTION & CONTROL;PSYCHOLOGICAL/PSYCHOLOGY;Eating Disorders;Eating,,
rayyan-984749328,Mostly 'Old Wine In New Bottles' Reply To Commentaries,2018,1,1,HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE,,,,,WADE MG,,,,,"Reply by the current authors to the comments made by david sugden (see record [rid]2018-05219-050[/rid]), reint h. Geuze (see record [rid]2018-05219-051[/rid]) and peter h. Wilson et al. (See record [rid]2018-05219-052[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2018-05219-049[/rid]). The validity of an information processing (ip) account as a causal explanation of developmental coordination disorder (dcd), sugden clearly shares the view that, to date, the empirical support for a contemporary ip explanation of dcd is less than compelling. The central theme of geuze’s commentary is the role of constraints, which is indeed crucial in the performance of all individuals across the lifespan. That said, it would seem that geuze is less concerned with evaluating a particular theoretical perspective, taking more of an 'individual difference' approach allowing theoretical explanations to fit a range of conclusions reached via the adopted empirical approach. The wilson et al. Commentary is both lengthy and detailed in its criticism. In their commentary, wilson et al. Avoid this challenge arguing in favor of the ip view that perception is indirect and requires an internal mechanism to assign 'meaning' to sense data. They argue that a more contemporary view of ip models – plus more imaging studies and meta-analytical or other reviews – somehow strengthens their view. Their resulting commentary is essentially a list of subheadings in the form of a series of promissory statements that may prove accurate at some future date.

However, little is known about the origin of biased social information processing. The current study explored the potential role of peer contagion in the emergence of hostile attribution in adolescents. One hundred thirty-four adolescents (m age = 13.8 years) were assigned to one of two manipulated 'chat-room' conditions, where they believed they were communicating with online peers (e-confederates) who endorsed either hostile or benign intent attributions. Adolescents showed increased hostile attributions following exposure to hostile e-confederates and reduced hostility in the benign condition. Further analyses demonstrated that social anxiety was associated with a reduced tendency to take on hostile peer attitudes. Neither gender nor levels of aggression influenced individual susceptibility to peer influence, but aggressive adolescents reported greater affinity with hostile e-confederates.

The contextual meaning of this idiom of distress in particular localities remains largely unknown. This paper reports on a systematic study of the content and cause, consequences, and social response and coping related to the local terms |x'an n|a te and |eu-ca n|a te, both translated as ``thinking a lot'' and was part of a larger ethnographic study among the khwe of south africa. Semi-structured exploratory interviews with community members revealed that ``thinking a lot'' refers to a common experience of reflecting on personal and interpersonal problems. Consequences were described in emotional, psychological, social, behavioral, and physical effects. Coping strategies included social support, distraction, and religious practices. Our contextualized approach revealed meanings and experiences of ``thinking a lot'' that go beyond a psychological state or psychopathology. The common experience of ``thinking a lot'' is situated in socio-political, economic, and social context that reflect the marginalized and displaced position of the khwe. We argue that ``thinking a lot'' and associated local meanings may vary across settings, may not necessarily indicate psychopathology, and should be understood in individual, interpersonal, community, and socio-political dimensions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,MENTAL HEALTH;THINKING TOO MUCH;IDIOMS OF DISTRESS;SOUTH AFRICA;SAN;South Africa;Thinking,,

Using fletcher's (1986) attributional complexity scale, mock jurors (n=186), who were shown a videotape of a simulated armed robbery, then rendered individual judgments on the case. The results showed that attributionally-simple subjects found the defendant guilty more often both before and after presentation of the evidence, reported more confidence in their final decision, and attributed mr,re personal causes to the defendant's behavior. Attributionally-complex subjects, while not excluding the role of internal causes, were more likely to consider external causes as possible influences on the defendant's behavior.

Early intervention can prevent it from developing into more progressive mental disorders. Combining information technology and clinical psychoeducation is a promising way to intervene at an earlier stage. However, data-driven research on the cognitive response to health information targeting adolescents with symptoms of depression is lacking.; Objective: this study aimed to fill this knowledge gap through a new understanding of adolescents' cognitive response to health information about depression. This knowledge can help to develop population-specific information technology, such as chatbots, in addition to clinical therapeutic tools for use in general practice.; Methods: the data set consists of 1870 depression-related questions posted by adolescents on a public web-based information service. Most of the posts contain descriptions of events that lead to depression. On a sample of 100 posts, we conducted a qualitative thematic analysis based on cognitive behavioral theory investigating behavioral, emotional, and symptom responses to beliefs associated with depression.; Results: results were organized into four themes. (1) hopelessness, appearing as a set of negative beliefs about the future, possibly results from erroneous beliefs about the causal link between risk factors and the course of depression. We found beliefs about establishing a sturdy therapy alliance as a responsibility resting on the patient. (2) therapy hesitancy seemed to be associated with negative beliefs about therapy prognosis and doubts about confidentiality. (3) social shame appeared as a consequence of impaired daily function when the cause is not acknowledged. (4) failing to attain social interaction appeared to be associated with a negative symptom response. In contrast, actively obtaining social support reduces symptoms and suicidal thoughts.; Conclusions: these results could be used to meet the clinical aims stated by earlier psychoeducation development, such as instilling hope through direct reattribution of beliefs about the future; challenging causal attributions, thereby lowering therapy hesitancy; reducing shame through the mechanisms of externalization by providing a tentative diagnosis despite the risk of stigmatizing; and providing initial symptom relief by giving advice on how to open up and reveal themselves to friends and family and balance the message of self-management to fit coping capabilities. An active counseling style advises the patient to approach the social environment, demonstrating an attitude toward self-action.

A purposive sample (n = 19) was selected from participants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial conducted in los angeles, california (united states) testing the effectiveness of a health services quality improvement intervention. Four focus groups followed by 10 in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted. Data were analyzed using the methodology of coding, consensus, cooccurrence, and comparison, an analytical strategy rooted in grounded theory. Depression was perceived as a serious condition linked to the accumulation of social stressors. Somatic and anxiety-like symptoms and the cultural idiom of nervios were central themes in low-income hispanics' explanatory models of depression. The perceived reciprocal relationships between diabetes and depression highlighted the multiple pathways by which these two illnesses impact each other and support the integration of diabetes and depression treatments. Concerns about depression treatments included fears about the addictive and harmful properties of antidepressants, worries about taking too many pills, and the stigma attached to taking psychotropic medications. This study provides important insights about the cultural and social dynamics that shape low-income hispanics' illness and treatment experiences and support the use of patient-centered approaches to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and depression.

The aim of the present study was to employ a fully data-driven approach to study the brain mechanism of extraversion in a sample of 111 healthy adults. The eysenck personality questionnaire (epq) was used to measure the personality characteristics of all the subjects. We investigated whether the subjects can be grouped into highly homogeneous communities according to the characteristics of their intrinsic connectivity networks (icns).

Ss also completed an attributional style questionnaire, a scale designed to measure life experiences with noncontingency, and a depression inventory. It was hypothesized that exposure to noncontingent outcomes, both in a laboratory and historically, would result in more depressive attributions than would exposure to contingent outcomes or to no outcomes. The manipulation of feedback contingencies produced the predicted effect on attributions for positive and negative events combined into a single composite difference score. A correlation between life experiences with noncontingency and attributions was found only for the positive events measure; however, such life experiences were correlated significantly with depression.

Little is known about this sense making, or how clinicians might support this ambiguity. This paper explored finite details of how five families do ‘sense-making’ in conversations with each other, while on the waiting list for an asc assessment. A discursive psychology analysis of these conversations found that sense making was affected by (1) an interactional pattern of interruptions impeding the progress of sense making narratives; (2) face saving to maintain positive identities and shared understanding; and (3) difficulties in word finding within sense making narratives. These practices challenged the production of a coherent family sense making narrative.

Data stem from a randomized control clinical trial with 70 people. The linguistic inquiry and word count program was used to analyse patient language. Absolute change scores and reliable change index were used to calculate reduction in grief symptoms and clinical significant change. Best subset regression and mann-whitney u tests were conducted. A higher reduction of prolonged grief symptoms was correlated with more social words in the first module (beta = -.22, p = .042), less risk (beta = .33, p = .002) and body words (beta = .22, p = .048) in the second module and more time words in the third module (beta = -.26, p = .018).

Findings suggest that it may be beneficial for therapists to encourage a more detailed description of patients' relationship with their deceased relative during the first module, a change in perspective during the second module and a summary of past, present and future aspects at the end of therapy.

Three studies reported on depressive symptoms (dss) in mainland chinese children. Study 1 showed that dss were widely present in chinese children. There were more symptoms in boys, in younger children, in children of less educated and less wealthy parents, in children from multi-child families, in children from single-parent families, in children from families in turmoil, and in children with lower academic achievement and conduct problems. In study 2, 185 chinese children in beijing were followed for 8 months. A pessimistic explanatory style was associated with higher concurrent levels of dss and higher levels at subsequent tests as well. There was strong evidence that the interaction of a pessimistic explanatory style and negative life events predicted higher levels of future dss. In study 3, we implemented an 'optimistic child' type intervention program for 220 chinese children who were selected from 1,425 students based on dss and family conflict and were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group. At the post-test and the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, children who participated in the intervention program showed significantly fewer dss.

E. Macduffie & t. J. Strauman (see record [rid]2017-14642-003[/rid]). Macduffie and strauman argue for an explanatory approach to science translation—as a way to improve individuals’ perceptions of their own states of mental health, their treatment-seeking behaviors, and their treatment outcomes. At its core, though, their article is about framing—the ways in which information presentation shapes perceptions, understandings, and motivation. It asks important framing questions and offers intriguing framing hypotheses. There are several important points and extensions to the arguments that macduffie and strauman make that make their work of greater value to an even wider set of researchers and practitioners. Their thesis about the effects of auto-biological explanations on individual behaviors is fascinating and the article discusses how a shift in research priorities has led to a shift in public understanding. They conclude that 'biological information has the potential to powerfully impact an individual and thus should be communicated with careful consideration and forethought.'

Through 30 open-ended interviews with ultraorthodox mothers of children with autism we portray the mothers' emerging recognition of the disorder, their care seeking activities, and their construction of explanatory models. The health care system on which the ultraorthodox mothers rely is extremely diverse, including mainstream medical and educational services, various alternative therapies, therapies specific to autism, and spiritual and mystical interventions. The outcome of these endeavors is a dual system of illness perception in which bio-medical and spiritual-religious frames of references coexist. This duality cuts across all the facets of the explanatory system: etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis. Metaphysical accounts, and especially the notion of the transmigration of souls, serve as meta-accounts, bridging the epistemological gap between god's mysterious intention and the specific bodily mechanisms underlying the disorder. The religious and moral theme of suffering is highlighted in the narratives as a salient constituent of the ultraorthodox mothers' attempts to understand and come to terms with their plight.

Incest is emotionally devastating to a child as it involves betrayal, and the irretrievable loss of trust in the adults in the child's life. Little is written about the healing processes of incest survivors. The purpose of this study was to generate a substantive grounded theory that provides an explanatory schema for understanding the healing process of adult female incest survivors. The sample consisted of 10 adult women who had a history of incest and who volunteered to participate in in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed using grounded theory techniques. Data analysis revealed that these women had buried an integral part of the self because of the trauma of incest. The healing process required resurrecting the buried self through a series of seven phases. The model generated from this research provides a heuristic for nurse therapists that assists in assessing and counseling incest survivors.

However, obesity is often attributed to oversimplified and stigmatizing causal factors such as laziness, lack of willpower, and failure to take personal responsibility for one's health. Understanding of the causal factors that contribute to obesity among people with obesity may affect their weight management efforts. The current study explored associations between causal attributions for obesity and long-term weight loss, as well as examined potential changes in attributions with weight reduction. The 16-item causal attributions for obesity scale (rated 1-7) was administered to 178 patients seeking behavioral/pharmacological weight-loss treatment. Causal attributions and weight were assessed at baseline, after 14 weeks of a low-calorie diet, and again at weeks 24 and 52 of a subsequent randomized trial (i.e., 66 weeks total). Logistic and linear regression examined effects of baseline causal attribution ratings on weight loss. Higher baseline ratings of personal responsibility attributions predicted 38% reduced odds of achieving =10% weight loss at week 52 ( p  = 0.02). Causal attribution ratings did not change over time or correlate continuously with weight change. Thus, attributing obesity to a failure of personal responsibility may impair long-term weight management efforts for individuals seeking =10% weight loss. Targeted techniques are needed to reduce patients' stigmatizing beliefs about the causes of obesity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ATTITUDE TO HEALTH*;OBESITY MANAGEMENT*;WEIGHT LOSS*;OBESITY/*PSYCHOLOGY;ADULT;CAUSALITY;DIET;REDUCING;FEMALE;HUMANS;LINEAR MODELS;LOGISTIC MODELS;MALE;MIDDLE AGED;OBESITY/THERAPY;SOCIAL STIGMA;ATTRIBUTIONS;OBESITY;PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY;WEIGHT LOSS;Weight Loss;Obesity;Causality,,

Method: a cross-sectional survey in 2002 with self-report questionnaires assessing current levels of symptomatology, disability, attitudes towards mental illness, knowledge of prevalence and causes of mental illness, contact with mental illness and help-seeking behaviour and preferences and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help. Results: no significant relationship was found between symptom measures and measures of disability and help-seeking. Variables positively associated with general attitudes to seeking professional psychological help were: lower perceived stigma, and biological rather than person-based causal attributions for schizophrenia. Willingness to discuss mental health issues with a gp was predicted by the perceived helpfulness of the gp and by no other variable. Conclusions: causal attributions and perceived stigma rather than participants' levels of symptomatology and disability influence attitudes to help-seeking for mental health issues.

A selectively bred line of rats, susceptible to the learned helplessness model of depression, presents an opportunity to search for genes affecting either the depressive symptoms or the predisposition towards developing the disease. A microarray revealed a small set of genes with altered expression in the hippocampus of the congenitally helpless rats. We selected one of these genes, a member of the <U+03B3>-protocadherin family, for further study to determine the basis for the change in expression. Helpless animals demonstrated an increased expression of protocadherin gamma a11, primarily in ca1 neurons. In addition, the helpless resistant line displayed changes in expression that favored a more excitotoxic state. Protocadherins have been implicated in synapse development and may alter the connections within the hippocampus in a way that enhances the correlates of depression found in other brain regions of the learned helpless rat. A greater understanding of the function of the clustered protocadherins in the establishment of neuronal networks is required to determine how these molecules affect the functional characteristics of the helpless brain.

Adaptational outcomes were operationalized as depression and disability. Greater evidence was found for moderational than mediational models. Only one of six mediational hypotheses was significant: self-efficacy mediated the relationship between perceived control and disability. Four of six moderational hypotheses were significant in concurrent adaptation, and three of these remained significant when later adaptation was assessed. Moderational effects differed for depression and disability: when ra controllability or patient self-efficacy was low, internal, global, stable attributions for the cause of a symptom flare were linked to greater depression but less disability.

There is a long history behind the concept of a schema. The definitions that are used within the current cognitive therapies were created in the 1980s, influenced by constructivism (see rijkeboer, van genderen and arntz, 2007). Well-known clinic-oriented scientists, such as beck, segal, and young, developed explanatory models for psychopathology, with schemas and related concepts such as schema processes, coping styles, and schema modes as central parameters. In the meantime, use of the term 'schema' has become widespread within the psychotherapy world and is growing. Across the diverse schema theories, many definitions are used, resulting in just as much obfuscation (sec james, southam and blackburn, 2004). The terms 'coping style' and 'mode' also have several definitions. This chapter will explain these concepts, as defined by young, klosko, and weishaar (2003, 2005). However, young's schema approach continues to develop. In a forum of therapists and researchers, the discussion now is about the nature of the different concepts and their mutual relationships. This chapter will therefore conclude with a short summary of the main issues. (Psycinfo database record (c) 2023 apa, all rights reserved)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Qualitative research indicates that the disentanglement of pathology and genuine religiosity is an important issue for persons with bd and that some patients experience discrepancy between the explanatory models of mental health care professionals and religious leaders. The current study explores the ways patients with bd interpret religious experiences they have had during illness episodes, how this interpretation changes over an individual's lifetime, and the expectations of treatment that persons with bd have regarding these religious experiences. Semi-structured interviews with 34 stable bd patients were conducted by a hospital chaplain and a psychiatrist trainee. The method of analysis was interpretative phenomenological analysis. For many participants, a religious quest originated after a religious experience during mania, and then a variety of medical and religious sources supported the interpretation process. Most participants endorsed mixed medical and religious explanations for their experiences and tried to distinguish between spiritual and pathological features. The interpretation process changed over time, influenced by religious affiliation and views, mood swings and the course of bd, and communication with others about the experiences. Discourse about the experiences was often problematic within treatment; a majority expressed the need for recognition of the spiritual value of the experiences, together with a critical sounding board for reflecting on their meaning and the influence of bd. More attention could be paid to the subject in treatment, and the expertise of hospital chaplains could contribute to this.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,EXPLANATORY MODELS;INTERPRETATION;RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCES;BIPOLAR;DISORDER;Bipolar Disorder,,

While there is growing literature on the mental health literacy of adults, there has not been a parallel interest in mental health awareness of young people in nigeria. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the knowledge of and attitudes towards depression in undergraduate students. Methods: the study was a cross-sectional survey conducted from august to november 2019. Ethical approval for the study was sought from the university's research ethics committee. Consenting students across all levels were then sampled and recruited. Participants were presented with the `friend in need' questionnaire designed to elicit the participants' recognition of mental health disorders depicted in the form of a vignette. Results: out of the 415 questionnaires distributed, only 365 were adequately filled indicating an 88\% response rate. The majority of the participants were female (62.5\%) and a total of 132 respondents (36.2\%) correctly identified and labelled the depression vignette. Insomnia was the most identified symptom (29\%) of depression by the participants. More than one-quarter (30\%) of the participants reported that they would be extremely worried about the depressed character and believed it will take the character longer than a few months to recover (54\%). Friends were the most recommended source of help (33.1\%), followed by professionals (30.7\%) and then others.

Since the launch of autism research, there have been exciting advances in the genetics and neuroscience of autism spectrum disorder (asd). Because of the recent developments, autism research is expanding its scope to include adequately powered treatment studies, with a particular emphasis on research that reveals underlying mechanisms, either by testing causal hypotheses or by revealing variations in responses, which prompts refinement of explanatory models. From a scientific perspective, variations in severity and persistence into adulthood indicate the need for a range of treatment approaches. Almost since autism was first described, clinicians and researchers have appreciated that there is no one intervention that is effective for all individuals. The vast majority of treatment research for asd focuses on childhood. Clinicians who treat adolescents and adults with asd recognize the considerable morbidity caused by severe anxiety and also depression. At present, relatively little is known about how social disadvantage impacts outcome in asd, and often research participants are not representative of the entire population of affected individuals.

Data from 258 undergraduates (188 = majority; 70 = ethnic minority) revealed that racial/ethnic minority participants reported greater frequencies of cpv than majority white participants, and cpv was significantly associated with poorer psychological adjustment in young adulthood for all participants. Although attributions of skin color/ethnicity did not exacerbate the relationship between cpv and poor adjustment, the results do show that racial/ethnic minority participants are more likely than white participants to attribute all types of cpv to their skin color/ethnicity.

Several studies examining the level of public knowledge about the nature and dynamics of mental illness in sub-saharan africa in the last decade had concluded that such knowledge was poor and had called for further public enlightenment. What was thought to be mental health ignorance' has also been blamed for poor mainstream service utilization. These views however assume that non-alignment of the views of community dwellers in sub-saharan africa with the biomedical understanding of mental illness connotes ignorance', and that correcting such ignorance' will translate to improvements in service utilization. Within the framework of contemporary thinking in mental health literacy, this paper argues that such assumptions are not culturally nuanced and may have overrated the usefulness of de-contextualized public engagement in enhancing mental health service utilization in the region.

However, existing research only partially explains why some persons do accept health promotion messages and use preventive care, while others do not. This analysis explores 1) the psychosocial characteristics of those, within disadvantaged groups, who identify their previous experiences as racially discriminatory, 2) the extent to which perceived racism is associated with broader perspectives on societal racism and powerlessness, and 3) how these views relate to disadvantaged groups' expectation of mistreatment in healthcare, feelings of mistrust, and motivation to use care. Methods: using survey data from 576 african-american women, we explored the prevalence and predictors of beliefs and experiences related to social disengagement, racial discrimination, desired and actual racial concordance with medical providers, and fear of medical research. We then used both sociodemographic characteristics, and experiences and attitudes about disadvantage, to model respondents' scores on an index of personal motivation to receive breast cancer screening, measuring screening knowledge, rejection of fatalistic explanatory models of cancer, and belief in early detection, and in collaborative models of patient-provider responsibility. Results: age was associated with lower motivation to screen, as were depressive symptoms, anomie, and fear of medical research. Motivation was low among those more comfortable with african-american providers, regardless of current provider race. However, greater awareness of societal racism positively predicted motivation, as did talking to others when experiencing discrimination. Talking was most useful for women with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: supporting the durkheimian concepts of both anomic and altruistic suicide, both disengagement (depression, anomie, vulnerability to victimization, and discomfort with non-black physicians) as well as over-acceptance (low awareness of discrimination in society) predict poor health maintenance attitudes in disadvantaged women. Women who recognize their connection to other african-american women, and who talk about negative experiences, appear most motivated to protect their health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Breast Neoplasms;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,

The teacher candidates in the study group were given a questionnaire for piano exam anxiety. Anxiety levels of students and their opinions on causes of anxiety were determined with the data collected through the questionnaire that identified personal anxiety levels in piano exams and the causes of anxiety. The exam scores of students in the piano class who were given the questionnaire were determined and associated with their anxiety levels for comparison. Various statistical processes (mean, t test, anova etc.) Were used to find out anxiety levels and to make comparison. The study concluded that the students had high anxiety levels in general, and a significant part of students with high anxiety level had relatively lower performance in piano class.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,COMPARISON;EXAM ANXIETY;PIANO;SUCCESS;Anxiety;Music,,

This study aimed to explore experiences, knowledge and perceptions of women with gdm to inform the design of interventions to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.; Methods: semi-structured interviews were carried out with 16 women with gdm who were recruited from a clinic in one scottish health board. A framework approach was used to manage and analyse data according to themes informed by psychological theory (self-regulation model and theory of planned behaviour).; Results: gdm is not seen as an important, or even real diagnosis among some women, and this perception may result from the perceived minimal impact of gdm on their lives. Some women did experience a bigger emotional and practical impact. Knowledge and understanding of type 2 diabetes was poor in general and many women were unconcerned about their future risk. Lower concern appeared to be linked to a lower perceived impact of gdm. Lifestyle changes discussed by women mostly related to diet and were motivated primarily by concern for their baby's health. Many women did not maintain these changes postnatally, reporting significant barriers.; Conclusions: this study has suggested potential avenues to be explored in terms of content, timing and potential recipients of interventions. Educational interventions postnatally could address illness perceptions in women with gdm and redress the situation where lack of aftercare downplays its seriousness. For lifestyle interventions, the child's health could be used as a motivator within the context of later joint or family interventions.

Following this misattribution manipulation, ss worked on a difficult anagrams task under instructions designed to either maximize or minimize anxiety. Only the anagrams performance of low test anxious ss who worked under anxiety-arousing instructions conformed to predictions from attribution theory.

rayyan-984749383,Social Problem-Solving As A Moderator Of Explanatory Style And Health,2001,1,1,NA,,,,,TRUNZO JJ,,,,,"There is a considerable amount of research supporting a relationship between explanatory style (es) and health outcomes. While this relationship is significant, the correlations are moderate at best, suggesting the likelihood of additional variables of influence. One potential moderating variable is problem-solving ability (peterson & seligman, 1987). Social problem-solving (sps) is a construct that has been shown to be important in various clinical and theoretical areas such as depression, obesity, and cancer (nezu, nezu & perri, 1989; nezu, nezu, houts, faddis, & friedman, 1998). It has also been shown to have a moderating effect on negative attributional style and depression (nezu, kalmar, ronan, & clavijo 1986). Given peterson and seligman's proposed relationship of problem-solving ability to es and health and the finding of sps as a moderator of negative attributional style and depression, it is worth investigating the relationships among sps, es, and health. It is hypothesized that sps will serve as a moderating variable of es and health. The potential benefits from this research could lead to programs aimed at improving problem-solving abilities and to gain a more positive es, therefore potentially increasing general health and decreasing the incidence and duration of illness. Eighty-three subjects completed measures of attributional style, social problem-solving ability, depression, stress, mood, and cold/flu symptoms over an 8-week period. Analyses of these data do not support a relationship among sps, es, and health. The variables that accounted for the greatest amount of variance in cold/flu symptoms were stress and mood. Given the correlational nature of the study, conclusions from these data are limited, but indicate that further research investigating the impact of psychosocial variables to physical health is warranted.

This is due in part to the fact that contemporary biomedical psychiatry rests on philosophically and scientifically ambiguous ground. In western medicine paradigms, theories from physics, chemistry, and biology form the basis of an explanatory model of illness, including mental illness. Symptoms are conceptualized as subjective descriptions of effects caused by factors characterized in empirical terms. Conventional biomedicine asserts that all causes of illness, and by extension, mechanisms of action underlying legitimate treatment approaches, rest on biological processes that can be described in the reductionist language of western science. However, in contemporary western psychiatry, there is no single adequate explanatory model of the causes of mental illness. What remains are competing psychodynamic, genetic, endocrinologic, and neurobiological models of symptom formation reflecting disparate ideological positions and diverse clinical training backgrounds of mental health professionals. There is no unifying theory in psychiatry because no single explanatory model has been confirmed as more valid than any other. I hypothesize in this article that the synthesis of ideas and clinical approaches from western biomedicine and non-western systems of medicine based on understandings of human consciousness, the neurosciences, complexity theory, and quantum field theory, will lead to rapid evolution of conventional western biomedical psychiatry toward truly integrative mental healthcare. The result will be the emergence of an integrative mental healthcare model that will more adequately address the disparate causes, conditions, and meanings of symptoms combining multimodal approaches from western biomedicine and non-westem systems of medicine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,PARADIGMS;PSYCHIATRY;MENTAL HEALTH;THEORIES OF CONSCIOUSNESS,,

Patients who attended their doctor frequently also made more pathological attributions than other groups. The results suggested that the capacity to make benign attributions reduces with anxiety.

The main aims of the present study were to explore the illness representations of individuals with multiple sclerosis (ms) and investigate the relationship of these beliefs to outcome. Based on leventhal et al.'S- self-regulation model, the commonly accepted generic five-component structure of illness representations including identity, time-line, consequences, cause, and cure/controllability was used. Design. A cross-sectional, correlational design was employed for the study. Interrelationships among the illness representation components and the relationships between the components and outcome were explored using pearson's r to determine the contribution of the illness representation components to the explained variance in outcome, a series of stepwise multiple regression analyses was used. Method. A total of 99 participants took part in the study. A series of measures were completed to assess (1) illness representations and (2) five specific areas of outcome. Results. Participants' illness representations of ms were consistent with the medical nature and understanding of this illness indicating that they held the perceptions of a strong illness identity, chronic time-line, no particular cause and no cure. Beliefs in the serious consequences of ms and limited control were also reported. Some important interrelationships among the illness representation components were demonstrated where a strong illness identity, chronic time-line view and perception of low control were related to more serious consequences. Overall, evidence was provided to suggest that illness representations contribute to outcome. The consequences component was associated with, and contributed to, the explained variance for each of the five outcome areas, indicating that the perception that ms has many-negative effects on an individual's life was associated with greater levels of difficulty in all of the outcome areas. In addition, for each of the outcome variables, different combinations of illness representation components explained their variance. For example, higher levels of depression were associated with perceptions of a stronger illness identity, more serious consequences, acute time-line, and low control. Conclusion. Overall support is provided for the application of the five-component structure of illness representations to ms and the likely contribution of such beliefs to outcome. The concept of illness representations therefore provides a useful framework for understanding the psychosocial effects of this illness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA;Multiple Sclerosis,,

This was accompanied by a process of deinstitutionalization of mental health-care services, which has led families to become the main providers of care to individuals with mental illness. This study explores the experiences of informal family caregivers of persons with mental illness in a rural area in south africa. Data were collected through eight individual semistructured interviews of informal caregivers who cared for relatives with mental illness and collect medications monthly at a community clinic in the makhuduthamaga local municipality in limpopo, south africa. A qualitative research design was used, which was explorative, descriptive, and contextual. The data analysis revealed four major themes: (i) experiences of providing for physiological/physical needs; (ii) experiences of providing for emotional needs; (iii) experiences of providing for security needs; and (iv) experiences associated with the medical health-care programme. The study revealed that the experiences of family caregivers were conceptualized negatively, although the interview questions were intentionally neutral. This is believed to be due to the cultural explanatory models of mental illness prevalent in this region of south africa. It is suggested that to increase compliance with medication, reduce relapse, and mitigate stigma associated mental illness, medical professionals need to incorporate aspects of cultural explanatory models into their explanations of the causes of illness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,CAREGIVER EXPERIENCE;INFORMAL CAREGIVER;MENTAL ILLNESS;QUALITATIVE;RESEARCH;SOUTH AFRICA;Rural Population;South Africa;Caregivers,,

Biological psychiatry, enthusiastically supported by the pharmaceutical industry, insists on trying to educate the public that they are wrong. This ``mental illness is an illness like any other'' approach to destigmatisation ignores the large body of research evidence that biogenetic explanations actually fuel fear and prejudice. If future destigmatisation programs are to be evidence-based and therefore effective, they will need to avoid illness-type explanations and labels and focus instead on increasing contact with the people against whom the prejudice is targeted and on highlighting the social causes of their difficulties.

However, the relevance of gratitude in the context of palliative care needs to be confirmed. Objectives: we strived to evaluate the association between gratitude and quality of life (qol), psychological distress, post-traumatic growth, and health status in palliative patients, and to develop an explanatory model for qol. An ancillary purpose was to identify which life domains patients considered sources of gratitude. Design: we performed an exploratory and cross-sectional study with palliative patients of the lausanne university hospital. Measurements: we used the gratitude questionnaire, the mcgill quality of life questionnaire revised, the hospital anxiety and depression scale, the post-traumatic growth inventory, and the health status items of the eastern cooperative oncology group. Spearman correlations and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: sixty-four patients participated (34 women, mean age=67). The results showed significant positive correlations between gratitude and qol (r=0.376), and the appreciation of life dimension of the post-traumatic growth (r=0.426). Significant negative correlations were found between gratitude and psychological distress (r=-0.324), and health status (r=-0.266). The best model for qol explained 47.6\% of the variance (f=26.906) and included psychological distress and gratitude. The relational dimension was the most frequently cited source of gratitude (61\%). Conclusion: gratitude may act positively on qol and may protect against psychological distress in the palliative situation.

Second, we anticipate that the pcat will be related significantly to measures of attributional style, suggesting that measures of as may be confounded by cognitive development when applied to child and adolescent populations. Our third aim is to clarify the potential moderating effect of cognitive development on the relations among attributional style, negative life events, and depression. We hypothesize that when as is measured at early levels of cognitive development (as operationalized by low scores on the pcat), it will not relate to depression in the manner anticipated by attributional models of depression (abramson et al., 1989). That is, it will not interact with negative life events to predict level of depression symptoms. Conversely, we also hypothesize that individuals at later levels of cognitive development (operationalized by higher scores on the pcat and supporting measures) do have the cognitive capacity for true depressive attributional style, and that measures of as will interact with nles to predict level of depressive symptoms.

All participants were asked to complete the attribulional style questionnaire (asq), coping style questionnaire (csq), and beck depression inventory (bdi). Data were analyzed by using the multi-variable regression and pearson's correlation methods. Results showed that for female students, coping style and attributions of negative event to global and stable causes were significantly correlated with depression (p < .001). Furthermore the results of the present study showed that problem-focused coping was more important than attributional styles for predicting depression.

Personal perceived control is known to be an important element of adaptation to their medical condition. The objectives of this work are to determine if perceived personal control is predictive of the clinical activity of the disease and of psychological distress (depression, anxiety).; Methods: the hospital anxiety depression scale (hads), the causal dimension scale and the clinical global impression (cgi; assessing perceived severity) were administered to 160 patients affected by crohn's disease. Indicators of inflammation (crp), disease duration and clinical activity of the disease were also asessed.; Results: globally, cd patients perceive their disease as being personally neither controllable nor uncontrollable. Whereas psychological distress is significantly higher when the disease is active, the relationship between the variables appears complex. The feeling of personal control is explained by the clinical activity of the disease (p=.0001) and by the perception that cd is unstable (p<.00001) and globally impacts the life of patients (p=.001). Nevertheless perception of personal control does not explain the clinical activity of the disease. Finally, psychological distress is explained by the perception that the medical team is unable to control the disease (p=.00001) and by the global consequences of the disease on life (p<.005).; Conclusions: psychological treatments should take these dimensions into account so as to improve the well-being and medical conditions of patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,IBD;ANXIETY;CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS;DEPRESSION;DISEASE ACTIVITY;PERCEIVED SEVERITY;Crohn Disease,,

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) presents a paradigmatic instance of this objection, marked as it is by `representation hungry' obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior organized around them. In this paper i provide an ecological-enactive account of ocd, thereby demonstrating non-representational frameworks can `scale up' to explain `representation hungry' cognition. First, i outline a non-representational account of mind- a predictive processing operationalization of sean kelly's theory of perception. This account explains the `tensions' and `pulls' which guide and constrain our action-oriented and affect-laden perceptual `grip' upon the world to be underwritten by an imperative to minimize prediction error. I then argue that ocd is best understood as `grip gone awry'- malformed predictive models signal inappropriately high error, and this results in extremely strong `tensions' and `pulls' which prescribe (allostatic) actions. Thus, i arrive at the idea that ocd is primarily constituted by `not just right' feelings caused by high error signaling. Finally, i explain that this account provides a causal explanation of the non-representationalexistential feelingfundamental to ocd. Compulsions are considered manifestations of non-representational grip responsive to this feeling, whilst obsessions are explained to play a meta-role in the condition, being formulated by subjects in a bid to make their `not just right' feeling intelligible. I explain that the meta-role obsessions play makes their representational status largely irrelevant to ocd, and so leave this an open question. Consequently, i provide a non-representational account of ocd, thereby demonstrating that ecological-enactive approaches can respond to the `scaling up' objection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,OCD;NON-REPRESENTATIONAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;`SCALING-UP' OBJECTION;;ENACTIVE AND ECOLOGICAL ACCOUNTS OF MIND;PREDICTIVE PROCESSING;ACTIVE;INFERENCE;ANTI-REPRESENTATIONALISM;REPRESENTATION HUNGER;PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,,

I will start by distinguishing between strong and minimal ways to understand the medical model before i move on to talk about explanation. The basic idea of this chapter is that the logic of the medical model, together with recent developments in the sciences of the brain, suggests that psychiatry should be seen as a kind of cognitive neuroscience. The second part of the chapter discusses some issues in applying mechanistic explanatory models to mental disorders. Recent philosophical work on explanation in the cognitive neurosciences has seen it as mechanistic explanation.

The risk factors for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (cia) and the underlying mechanisms are unclear.; Aim: to ascertain the genetic and immunological risk factors for cia, and on the basis of these findings to construct an explanatory model for cia.; Method: we reviewed the literature via medline (from 1966 to may 2004) and embase (from 1980 to may 2004) using the search terms 'clozapine' and 'agranulocytosis'.; Results: we found 8 case-control studies that fulfilled our selection criteria. In schizophrenia patients, cia appeared to be significantly associated with certain haplotypes of hla (human leukocyte antigens) genes, with the 4b,3d microsatellite alleles of tnf (tumor necrosis factor), with variant genes of hsp 70 (heat-shock protein), and with nqo2 (dihydronicotinamide riboside quinone oxidoreductase) gene polymorphism. Most of these genetic findings are interrelated. Gene abnormalities of this kind probably play an important aetiological role in cia and may provide a basis for the construction of an immuno-toxic explanatory model for cia.; Conclusion: it seems likely that cia can be explained on the basis of genetic and immunotoxic factors. The model should help us to understand how agranulocytosis can be caused by various antipsychotics and how it can be treated. However, it is not yet possible to identify patients who are particularly at risk for cia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,AGRANULOCYTOSIS/*CHEMICALLY INDUCED;AGRANULOCYTOSIS/*GENETICS;ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS/*ADVERSE EFFECTS;CLOZAPINE/*ADVERSE EFFECTS;MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX/*GENETICS;ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS/THERAPEUTIC USE;CLOZAPINE/THERAPEUTIC USE;GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO DISEASE;HLA ANTIGENS/GENETICS;HUMANS;RISK FACTORS;SCHIZOPHRENIA/DRUG THERAPY;Clozapine;Risk Factors,,

The study was cross-sectional in design, testing 72 patients with cancer receiving intravenous chemotherapy as outpatients in the united kingdom. The participants completed questionnaires measuring number and perceived severity of symptoms, the causal attributions of these, illness and treatment beliefs, anxiety, and depression. The results showed that consequence beliefs serve as important mediators between number of symptoms and distress, explaining 15\% of the variance in anxious mood and 5\% of the variance in depressed mood.

Familiarity was varied by having half of the ss give a pretest speech, while arousal was manipulated by having half of the ss ingest caffeine while the others ingested a placebo just prior to the test speech. Ss' attributions were varied by giving them either arousal or irrelevant symptom instructions regarding the effects of the ingested drug. Direct suggestion rather than misattribution effects occurred: those ss receiving arousal symptoms reported more nervousness than ss who had received irrelevant symptoms.

Research in other disorders suggests that genetic causal attributions can influence patients' psychological responses and coping strategies, but little is known about how epilepsy patients and their relatives will respond to genetic attributions of epilepsy. We investigated the possibility that among members of families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy, depression, the most frequent psychiatric comorbidity in the epilepsies, might be related to the perception that epilepsy has a genetic cause. Methods: a self-administered survey was completed by 417 individuals in 104 families averaging 4 individuals with epilepsy per family. Current depression was measured with the patient health questionnaire. Genetic causal attribution was assessed by three questions addressing the following: perceived likelihood of having an epilepsy-related mutation, perceived role of genetics in causing epilepsy in the family, and (in individuals with epilepsy) perceived influence of genetics in causing the individual's epilepsy. Relatives without epilepsy were asked about their perceived chance of developing epilepsy in the future, compared with the average person. Results: prevalence of current depression was 14.8\% in 182 individuals with epilepsy, 6.5\% in 184 biologic relatives without epilepsy, and 3.9\% in 51 individuals married into the families. Among individuals with epilepsy, depression was unrelated to genetic attribution. Among biologic relatives without epilepsy, however, prevalence of depression increased with increasing perceived chance of having an epilepsy-related mutation (p = 0.02). This association was not mediated by perceived future epilepsy risk among relatives without epilepsy. Significance: depression is associated with perceived likelihood of carrying an epilepsy-related mutation among individuals without epilepsy in families containing multiple affected individuals. This association should be considered when addressing mental health issues in such families.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,EPILEPSY;EPIDEMIOLOGY;GENETICS;DEPRESSION;GENETIC ATTRIBUTION;Epilepsy;Depression;Causality,,

All patients were investigated using structured interviews and self-rating scales [screening for somatoform symptoms (soms), beck depression inventory (bdi), beck anxiety inventory, and a 12-item instrument to assess causal attributions]. By means of factor analysis, the following illness attributions were considered: vulnerability to infection and environmental factors, psychological factors, organic causes including genetic and aging factors, and distress (including exhaustion and time pressure). Results: most patients reported multiple illness attributions. The more somatoform symptoms patients had, the more explanations in general they considered. Especially for vulnerability and organic illness beliefs, patients with somatoform symptoms had increased scores. Comorbidity with depression and with anxiety disorders was associated with more psychological attributions. Even when the influence of somatization, depression, and anxiety is controlled for, illness beliefs still showed associations with illness behavior. Organic causal beliefs and vulnerability attributions were associated with a need for medical diagnostic examinations, increased expression of symptoms, increased illness consequences, and bodily scanning. Conclusions: multiple causal attributions can coexist demonstrating different associations with comorbid depression and illness behavior. (C) 2004 elsevier inc.

The cultural formulation interview (cfi) for dsm-5 provided a tool enabling wider use of cultural formulation in clinical cultural assessment. Validation to justify the inclusion of the cfi in dsm-5 involved quantitative analysis of debriefing interviews of patients and clinicians for feasibility, acceptability and clinical utility. We now further examine qualitative field trial data from the cfi interviews and the debriefing interviews in pune, india. Administration of the cfi was followed by routine diagnostic assessment of 36 psychiatric outpatients-11 found to have severe mental disorders (smd) and 25 with common mental disorders (cmd). Domain-wise thematic analyses of the cfi and debriefing interviews identified recurrent themes based on cultural identity, illness explanatory models, stressful and supportive social relationships, and the impact of political, economic, and cultural contexts. A tendency to elaborate accounts, rather than simply name their problem, and more diverse past help-seeking distinguished cmd from smd groups.

The informal carers completed the modified illness perception questionnaire (ipqs-relatives version) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, spearman's rank order correlations and ancova regression models, to identify predictors of anxiety and depression respectively in the informal carers.resultsthe informal carers perceived depression as a cyclical condition, having negative consequences on both the patient and on themselves. Participants perceived the causes of depression to be mainly psychosocial in nature and generally viewed the treatment as effective. Caring for a person with depression was perceived as having a considerable negative emotional impact on them. Years of caring was identified as a predictor of anxiety accounting for 20.4\% of the variance, and timeline chronicity beliefs, consequences (relative) and illness coherence were identified as predictors of depression, accounting for 56.8\% of the variance.conclusionillness cognitions are significant predictors of depression, thereby suggesting that cognition-based interventions may be effective in targeting depression in these informal carers. Thus, health professionals should explore the carers' personal understanding of the disease, their timeline beliefs and the perceived consequences of providing care, as they relate to their psychological well-being.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,INFORMAL CARERS;DEPRESSION;ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS;PSYCHOLOGICAL;WELL-BEING;COMMON-SENSE MODEL;QUANTITATIVE;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section;Anxiety,,

In the case of social anxiety disorder (sad), there is a broad consensus that this disorder is the result of interaction between genetic and environmental factors. However, little is known about how much each factor contributes to this interaction. In this sense, the study of heritability is of great value for a better understanding about the development and maintenance of sad. This chapter aims to review the methodological designs that have been used to evaluate the heritability of sad, as well as to present the main results from these designs. Among these, this chapter has a special emphasis on the role of studies involving twins, due to the advantages that this method provides for the study of the heritability of sad. Heritability of sad is analyzed considering the development in early life and gender differences. Future directions of research on the heritability of sad are also suggested from the review of the studies, allowing for the constant updating and sophistication of the explanatory models of the disorder.

Our results indicate that in cases in which both concepts are favourable, the patient suffered minor psychiatric disorders with stable psychic structures and the symptoms were associated with medical or environmental causes. If both concepts were unfavourable, a higher proportion of psychiatric disorders with unstable psychic structures were present.

However, existing self-report measures of parental attributions do not account for the possibility that dysfunctional parent-causal attributions for child misbehavior might be important predictors of poor family functioning. To address these concerns, the authors developed and tested a new measure of both parent-causal and child-responsible attributions for child misbehavior in a sample of 453 community couples. Structural validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, internal consistency, and temporal stability of the new measure were examined. As expected, confirmatory factor analysis resulted in 2 factors, child-responsible (9 items) and parent-causal (7 items); the final model was cross-validated in a holdout sample. The final scale demonstrated adequate internal consistency (alpha s = .81-90), test-retest reliability (rs = .55-76), and convergent and discriminant validity. Dysfunctional parent-causal and child-responsible attributions significantly predicted parental emotional problems, ineffective discipline, parent-child physical aggression, and low parenting satisfaction. Associations with parent-child aggression and parenting satisfaction were generally larger than with partner aggression and relationship satisfaction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ATTRIBUTIONS;PARENTING;MOTHERS;FATHERS;MEASUREMENT,,

Beyond issues of diagnostic validity, assessment methods and potential detection strategies are explored. Methods: a painstaking analysis was conducted of the msbp and fdbp literature as it, relates diagnostic and assessment issues. Given-the limitations of this literature, extrapolations were provided from the extensive theory and research on malingering as a related response style. Results: diagnostic formulations for both msbp and fdbp de-emphasize the clinical characteristics of the perpetrator. In the case of fdbp, inferential judgments about motivation (e.g., adoption of a sick role) are challenging on conceptual and clinical grounds. When explanatory models from malingering are applied, most research has focused pathogenic models, often allied with psychodynamic thought. Finally, clinical methods for the assessment of msbp and fdbp are not well developed. Conclusions: refinements in the conceptualization of msbp and fdbp can be-provided through prototypical analysis. Drawing from malingering research, explanatory models should be expanded to include adaptational and criminological models. Finally,.

Anhedonia, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure, is a hallmark symptom of major depression, schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including cerebrovascular disorders. Since stroke survivors frequently suffer from depression, research has focused on the incidence, phenomenology, course and risk factors of post-stroke depression (psd), paying special attention to the biological explanatory models, such as the lesion location and vascular depression hypotheses. Small vessel pathology and microvascular lesions are no longer considered as minor players in the fields of cognitive impairment and mood regulation. Unlike cognition, the relationship between these lesions and mood dysregulation is still a matter of intense debate. However, the chronic accumulation of lacunes in thalamus, basal ganglia and deep white matter has been recently considered as a strong correlate of psd. In addition to such biological approaches, the role of psychosocial factors should not be neglected. This chapter is aimed at investigating the complex relationship between depressive mood and cerebrovascular disorders, either acute or chronic, with particular regards to the etiology and prevalence of the disabling symptom anhedonia in psd.

Understanding the theoretical framework of stigma will help to inform the development of anti-stigma interventions and to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. The attribution model and the dangerousness model have been proposed and previously evaluated as theoretical models of mental illness stigma. This research evaluated the applicability of these models among high school students both prior to and following an anti-stigma intervention that included both education and contact with a person who has experienced a serious mental illness. Two proposed models, the education/contact response model on attribution and the education/contact response model on dangerousness, incorporated the anti-stigma intervention with the components of the attribution model and the dangerousness model and were also tested. Path analysis was used to assess model fit. The attribution model was supported by data collected prior to the education and contact intervention, but was not supported by data collected after the intervention. The dangerousness model was not supported by data collected either before or after the education and contact intervention. Lastly, neither the education/contact response model on attribution nor the education/contact response model on dangerousness was supported. These findings suggest that none of the tested models can suitably be applied to both existing attitudes and post-intervention attitudes. Future research needs to reassess the critical components that should be included in a theoretical model of stigma, possibly using qualitative research to identify these components, and consider taking a broader approach in combating mental illness stigma by framing it as a social injustice.

Explanatory models and psychological appraisals of psychosis in family members impact insight, treatment, and recovery of the patient with psychosis (pwp) (claxton et al., 2017), and are utilized by both patients and families to cope with a disabling syndrome like psychosis (jacob, 2014). Studies have focused primarily on the pwp's understanding of the illness and the bio-medical theories of psychosis, and recommend strengthening this discourse by increasing understanding of the carer's meaning making of pwp (schizophrenia port, 2009; jacob, 2014). This phenomenological study examined the meaning making experiences of family members (n=12) who identified as carers/caregivers of pwp. Interviews were analyzed with an interpretative phenomenological analysis approach (smith & osborn, 2008) to reveal seventeen primary themes that explained the carers' experiences of the first episode of psychosis, treatment phases, the illness of psychosis, carer roles, and family dynamics. Results found that carers experienced the first episode of psychosis as a crisis, during which they mourned the loss of relatability with pwp and felt responsible for their relative's wellness. However, at the point of hospitalization they were denied participation in treatment, resulting in significant emotional experiences of exclusion and powerlessness. The carers' appraisals of the illness facilitated tolerance of the psychotic content and helped them in re-relating and mourning pwp. Both processes of mourning and increasing sense of connection speak to integration, thus indicating that an attempt at meaning making of the illness started a process of integration. Finally, the study found that the carer role was a solitary experience of burden, anger, and acceptance wherein carers navigated changes in the family unit and attachment injuries with their loved one with psychosis. Overall, these experiences were understood as being related to a sense of emotional trauma in the carers. The study concludes with a discussion of strengths and limitations, directions for future study, and clinical implications of these findings in family interventions.

A Systematic Review And Meta-Ethnography From The Perspective Of Patients,2012,1,1,PLOS ONE,,,,,MONFORTE-ROYO C and VILLAVICENCIO-CHAVEZ J and MAHTANI-CHUGANI V and BALAGUER A,,,,,"Background: there is a need for an in-depth approach to the meaning of the wish to hasten death (wthd). This study aims to understand the experience of patients with serious or incurable illness who express such a wish. Methods and findings: systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies from the patient's perspective. Studies were identified through six databases (isi, pubmed, psycinfo, cinahl, cuiden and the cochrane register of controlled trials), together with citation searches and consultation with experts. Finally, seven studies reporting the experiences of 155 patients were included. The seven-stage noblit and hare approach was applied, using reciprocal translation and line-of-argument synthesis. Six main themes emerged giving meaning to the wthd: wthd in response to physical/psychological/spiritual suffering, loss of self, fear of dying, the desire to live but not in this way, wthd as a way of ending suffering, and wthd as a kind of control over one's life ('having an ace up one's sleeve just in case'). An explanatory model was developed which showed the wthd to be a reactive phenomenon: a response to multidimensional suffering, rather than only one aspect of the despair that may accompany this suffering. According to this model the factors that lead to the emergence of wthd are total suffering, loss of self and fear, which together produce an overwhelming emotional distress that generates the wthd as a way out, i.e. To cease living in this way and to put an end to suffering while maintaining some control over the situation. Conclusions: the expression of the wthd in these patients is a response to overwhelming emotional distress and has different meanings, which do not necessarily imply a genuine wish to hasten one's death. These meanings, which have a causal relationship to the phenomenon, should be taken into account when drawing up care plans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,NA,,

Sixty-two men from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds were recruited from an unemployment center in a large industrial city and were followed for 3 months. Adherence to the specific masculine norms of emotional control and self-reliance accounted for variance in concurrent depressive symptoms after statistically controlling for attributional processes. At the 3-month follow-up, only amn predicted depressive symptoms after accounting for attributional processes and initial depressive symptoms. Negative attributional style was negatively associated with the likelihood of reemployment at the 3-month follow-up while amn was positively associated with the likelihood reemployment. Results suggested that amn may be an important sociocultural factor contributing to depression that is largely independent of attributional processes.

STOYANOV D and STIEGLITZ RD,,,,,"Introduction and aim: contemporary psychopathology has adopted various approaches to establish its validity, such as content, criteria, convergent, divergent etc. Validation procedures. However, regardless of the progress in neuroscience, it has not been incorporated yet in psychiatric diagnosis as a possible source of external validity. In this paper, we aim at defining die construct of translational validity, which may eventually bridge the two fields of inquiry separated by the explanatory gap. Argument: both modern clinical assessment tools and functional imaging are validated within their disciplinary domains: clinical inventories are validated with other clinical tests or interviews while neurobiological markers are validated against other biological measures. The currently employed experimental neuroimaging designs inert psychological visual stimuli and can serve only as neutral in terms of diagnosis emotional stimuli. This is to say that such stimuli have no diagnostic value and hence cannot relate or be embodied into validity operations between neuro-biological markers of disease and psychopathology. In the same way, most of the clinical psychopathological assessment tools are not underpinned with robust neuroimaging findings. Whenever any connections between the two types of measures are established, they represent mere statistical post hoc correlations. Therefore, they are not regarded as translation validity operations. Yet, they need convergent translational cross-validation in order to be integrated into psychiatric diagnosis. Translational validity, on the other hand, represents the kind of validation to relate the two domains by means of translation. We suggest that brain imaging should involve real-time rating with disorder-relevant clinical scales performed simultaneously with fmri instead of the neutral picture stimuli. Conclusion: the novel paradigm for translational cross-validation among methods of psychiatry and neuroscience can potentially contribute to the integration of the inter-disciplinary explanatory models in psychiatry.

Many studies suggest a causal relationship between stress and the onset and exacerbation of both skin diseases. Many patients report psychological distress, mainly symptoms of anxiety and depression. The main factors that seem to mediate the impact of the condition are chiefly fear of rejection and perceptions of stigmatisation. The second part is about psychological treatment. Research is limited, but results are positive. Cognitive therapy has been examined only once, with no behavioural experiments. Exposure treatment has never been investigated. The article concludes with two case studies. Both treatments consisted of cognitive therapy with behavioural experiments and exposure therapy. Both patients improved strongly.

Vosgerau and a. Newen (see record [rid]2008-03618-019[/rid]). The authors offer a powerful explanation of the sense of agency. To argue for their model they attempt to show that one of the standard models fails to explain the sense of agency and that their model offers a more general account than is aimed at by the standard model. The authors present a model of the sense of agency (soa) over both bodily and mental actions. They argue that this model should replace one of the standard views in the field of self consciousness research. The particular position they take issue with is known as the comparator model (cm). This model holds that the soa over bodily actions is elicited based on a represented match between the predicted sensory consequences of an action and the actual sensory consequences of that action. On this model deficits in the soa observed in patients suffering delusions of control are explained by an inability to make this comparison, which in turn arises from deficits in the formation of, or access to, predicted sensory consequences of action. This model holds that the soa is elicited in the final stages of action execution by a single, low level, mechanism. Furthermore, the lack of specification of what mechanisms are involved in soa deficits for thoughts means that they have not yet shown how their model explains this phenomenon.

Addressing this gap, the present study examined multiple factors longitudinally that link parental depressive symptoms to adolescent adjustment problems, building on a conceptual model informed by emotional security theory (est). Participants were from 320 families (158 boys, 162 girls), including mothers and fathers, who took part when their children were in kindergarten (t1), second (t2), seventh (t3), eighth (t4) and ninth (t5) grades. Parental depressive symptoms (t1) were related to changes in adolescents' externalizing and internalizing symptoms (t5), as mediated by parents' negative emotional expressiveness (t2), marital conflict (t3), and emotional insecurity (t4). Evidence was thus advanced for emotional insecurity as an explanatory process in the context of parental depressive symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS;MARITAL CONFLICT;EMOTIONAL INSECURITY;EXPLANATORY;PROCESS;Adolescent,,

Community surveys of suicidal ideation have demonstrated that up to 24\% of adolescents have experienced suicidal thoughts at some point ill their lives. Rates of attempted suicide are highest among young people, and increased occurrence is reported, particularly among young males. A similar picture emerges with regard to completed suicide, and in some countries rates of suicide among young males are higher than those for older age groups. Risk factors can be grouped according to their social/familial, individual, or environmental nature. Based on these findings an explanatory model of suicidal behaviour can be developed, in which three criteria call be discerned: i.e. Trait-dependent factors, including those related to serotonin, personality and cognitive psychological dysfunctions; state-dependent characteristics, such as depression and hopelessness; and threshold factors, which mag have a risk enhancing or protective effect, such as social support, contagion effects, the availability of means, and the accessibility of mental health care. Preventive actions need to be developed, targeting the general population (through, for example, educational programmes) or populations at particular risk, such as adolescents attempting suicide. Potential treatment approaches include the treatment of individual psychopathological phenomena, whether or not in school-based clinics, but particular attention has to be given to inducting and keeping young people at risk in treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,ADOLESCENTS;SUICIDE;ATTEMPTED SUICIDE;EPIDEMIOLOGY;RISK FACTORS;;TREATMENT;PREVENTION;Suicide;Adolescent,,

Clinically depressed children may possess more negative attributional styles than those with other psychiatric disorders, but data are not conclusive. As for the crucial hypothesis that attributional style is associated with depression in the presence but not absence of negative life events, findings are decidedly mixed. It is concluded that attributional style and depression are correlated in children and adolescents.

Method: four specific aspects of the phenomenology of ahs (chosen on the basis of the predicted phenomenology of hv-ahs) were assessed using a semi-structured interview in 32 individual ahs taken from reports from 15 patients with psychosis. Results: cluster analysis (at the level of the individual ah-experience) offered support for the existence of a distinct hv-ah subtype, characterized by hearing threatening, externally-located voices when attention was externally-focused. Other clusters identified all shared the contrasting properties of occurring in quiet contexts when patients' attention was internally focused.

By understanding the differences in perceived causes between the two groups, better educational programs for lay people and those suffering from eating disorders can be developed.; Method: this study used open-ended questions to assess the beliefs of 57 individuals with self-reported eating disorders and 220 without. Participants responded to the questions, ""what do you think was (were) the cause(s) of your eating disorder?"" And ""what do you think is (are) the cause(s) of eating disorders?"".; Results: a list of possible codes for the causes of eating disorders was created based on a thorough review of the literature. A manually-generated set of eight codes was then created from individuals' actual responses. Frequencies and chi square analyses demonstrated differences in rates of endorsement between those with eating disorders and those without. Participants with eating disorders most frequently endorsed psychological/emotional and social problems, with genetics/biology and media/culture ideals least endorsed. Participants without eating disorders most frequently endorsed psychological/emotional problems and media/culture ideals, with traumatic life events and sports/health least endorsed. There was a difference between groups in the endorsement of the media as a cause of eating disorders, suggesting that those without eating disorders may overly attribute the media as the main cause while those with eating disorders may not be fully aware of the media's impact. Additionally, while both groups highly endorsed psychological/emotional problems, there was a noticeable stigma about eating disorders among those without eating disorders.; Conclusions: there were noteworthy differences between samples; such differences suggest that there is a need for more education on the topic of eating disorders. Furthermore, despite empirical support for the effects of genetics, sports, and family factors, these were infrequently endorsed as causes of eating disorders by both groups. Our results suggest that there is a need for more education regarding the factors associated with eating disorders, in order to reduce the stigma surrounding these disorders and to potentially aid the treatment process.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Included""}",,CAUSES;EATING DISORDERS;EDUCATION;MEDIA;PERCEPTIONS;PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS;STIGMA;Eating Disorders;Eating,,

Antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) are two of the most effective and widely used treatments for depression. Some research suggests that various causal attributions for depression may differentially effect treatment specific credibility and outcome expectancy. Purpose: the purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of biological and cognitive behavioral explanations on treatment credibility, outcome expectancy, and intentions to initiate antidepressant medication and cbt among a sample of participants meeting criteria for a current major depressive episode. Methods: the sample (n = 157) was recruited using amazon.com's mechanical turk crowd sourcing marketplace. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three active conditions describing their symptoms as being caused by biological, cognitive behavioral, multi-causal (combination of biological and cognitive behavioral), or a no-information control group. Next, participants read descriptions of antidepressant medication and cbt treatments. Following each description, participants completed measures of treatment credibility, outcome expectancy, and intention to initiate the treatment. Three separate 2 (antidepressant medication vs. Cbt) x 4 (biological, cognitive behavioral, multi-causal, or no-information control) mixed model anovas and a series of planned contrasts were used to examine group differences. Results: treatment credibility was significantly greater in the cbt condition compared to the antidepressant medication condition, p = .007, across all explanatory conditions. However, there were no other significant main-effects of treatment condition or explanatory condition on treatment credibility, expectancy, of willingness to initiate treatment. Similarly, the interaction of treatment and explanatory conditions did not significantly predict treatment credibility, expectancy, or intention to initiate treatment, all p's > .05. Planned contrasts showed no significant differences in causal explanatory condition treatment credibility, expectancy, or willingness to initiate treatment for antidepressant medication or cbt, all p's > .05. Conclusion: causal explanations had no impact on treatment credibility, outcome expectancy, or willingness to initiate either treatment for depression. Overall, participants reported very low willingness to initiate treatment for their depressive symptoms.

While in a `peace situation' subjects report 13 different categories of attributions, this number amounts to 25 in a `war situation.' Most of the reported attributions of sexual violence in peacetime concentrate around rapists' illness, madness, psychological disturbance or some mild form of a personality disorder. The answers for war situation are less stereotypic, reflecting not only dispositional but also situational attributions. The first three most frequently stated content categories are those that attribute the causes of sexual violence during wartime to anarchy, to specific war circumstances which are a `good opportunity for violence' and to expressions of extreme emotional states such as anger, hatred and retaliation. Significant gender differences were found on several content categories both in peace and in war situations.

Improving communication strategies on prognosis may help patients deal with the disease and adjust their long-term life goals. However, there is limited information on patients' preferences of long-term prognosis (ltp) communication and associated factors. Objective: the aim of this study was to describe patients' preferences and assess the factors associated with ltp communication preferences in early-stage relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms) patients. Methods: a multicenter, non-interventional study was conducted. Adult patients with a diagnosis of rrms, a disease duration from first attack <= 3 years, and an expanded disability status scale (edss) score of 0-5.5 were included. The prognosis in ms questionnaire was used to assess how much patients want to know about their ltp. Different patient-reported measures were administered to gather information on symptom severity, pain, fatigue, mood/anxiety, quality of life, stigma, illness perception, feeling of hopelessness, self-efficacy, information avoidance and coping strategies. Cognition was assessed using the symbol digit modalities test (sdmt). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between ltp information preference and demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as patients' perspectives. Results: a total of 189 patients were included (mean age: 36.1 +/- 9.4 years, 71.4\% female, mean disease duration: 1.2 +/- 0.8 years). Median edss score was 1.0 (iqr = 0.0-2.0). A proportion of 68.5\% (n = 126) of patients had never discussed ltp with their neurologists, whereas 69.2\% (n = 126) reported interest in knowing it (73.5\% at diagnosis). Bivariate analyses suggested that patients were significantly more likely to have higher ltp information preferences if they were male and had a lower sdmt score. Male gender and a lower sdmt score were predictors of ltp information preferences. Conclusions: patients with early-stage rrms want to discuss their ltp shortly after diagnosis. Understanding the factors involved may be useful to design individualized communication strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,"RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS;LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS;COMMUNICATION;EARLY-STAGE;PATIENTS ?

Research shows that individuals who believe that their attributes are fixed (rather than changeable) are more likely to have negative academic outcomes and negative moods. However, it remains unclear if these mindset theories represent a novel construct or if they overlap with the cognitive theories of depression which were theorized a decade earlier. According to the cognitive theories, people who attribute negative life events to stable and global (i.e., unchangeable) causes are more likely to become helpless and develop depression. The purpose of the current study was to test whether the newer mindset theories provide an incremental advance in knowledge or are more likely specific instances of a more general negative attributional style. To this end, we conducted a two time-point prospective study with 130 undergraduates. Contrary to hypotheses, results showed that intelligence mindset was distinct from negative attributional style. However, intelligence mindset did not demonstrate predictive or incremental validity; it did not predict end of semester gpa, dropping a class or depressive symptoms. In contrast, negative attributional style predicted both dropping a class and increases in depressive symptoms. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

This paper describes the causes of suicide attempts as perceived by the men themselves and analyzes their impact on severity and recidivism. Mental health surveys conducted among gay men in geneva, switzerland, from two probability-based time-space samples in 2007 and 2011, were merged to yield a combined sample n = 762. Suicide ideation, plans, and attempts were assessed, and respondents who had ever attempted suicide answered open questions about perceived causes which were coded and categorized for analysis within the framework of cultural epidemiology. In all, 16.7\% of the respondents reported a suicide attempt in their lifetime (59.5\% of them with multiple attempts). At their latest attempt, over two thirds asserted intent to die, and half required medical assistance. There was a wide variety of perceived causes, with most individuals reporting multiple causes and many of the most common causes cited at both the first and most recent subsequent attempts. Social/ inter-personal problems constitute the most prominent category. Problems with love/relationship and accepting one's homosexuality figure consistently among the top three causes. Whereas the former tend to be associated with weaker intent to die, the latter are associated with the strongest intent to die and reported at multiple attempts. Problems with family are among the most common perceived causes at first attempt but not at the most recent subsequent attempt. Nevertheless, they tend to be related to the strongest intent to die and the greatest medical severity of all the perceived causes. Ten percent of men attempting suicide cited depression as a cause. Although it tended to be associated with weaker intent to die, depression was most likely to be reported at multiple attempts. Respondent-driven assessment yielded both common and idiosyncratic causes of suicide and their distinct effects. Some of these perceived causes are not prominent in the current literature, yet they have important implications for understanding risk and preventing suicide among gay men.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Isaac""=>""Excluded""}",,"SUICIDE;RECIDIVISM;CULTURAL EPIDEMIOLOGY;LIFE EVENTS;HOMOSEXUALITY;Homosexuality, Male;Suicide, Attempted;Suicide",,

Methods: participants were 60 individuals seeking care at a psychiatric clinic in bangalore, india. The majority of participants were female with a mean age of 36 years (sd = 9.75). Results: contrary to our prediction, there were no significant differences between men (m = 28.96; sd = 9.85) and women (m = 33.03; sd = 12.08) on depression severity, t(58) = 1.42, p = .16.

Populations in countries such as haiti demonstrate a high level of need for mental health services despite a lack of services and trained professionals. In addition to the dearth of biomedical services, local belief systems and explanatory models lead a majority of the population to rely on traditional medicine as their first option for care.the goal of this dissertation is to characterize mental health beliefs, practices, and services in northern haiti by examining the relationship between traditional beliefs and mental illness, assessing the impact of traumatic events on mental and physical health, and identifying predictors of mental health outcomes. Using a mixed-methods approach, this dissertation utilized in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, as well as anxiety, depression, and functionality scales to assess the status of mental health care in early 21st century northern haiti.study findings indicate that mental illness is strongly impacted by traumatic events experienced in the context of society-scale crises, which have a significant effect on physical and mental health. Ongoing socio-political crises in particular result in high levels of violence and disorder which affect population- and individual-level mental health. Culturally-competent, evidence-based mental health services, such as those offered at sant sante mantal mòn pele (ssmmp) represent a unique opportunity for treatment for those suffering from mental illness in this region. However, the vast majority of patients requiring mental health care first seek treatment from traditional healers such as vodou priests, whose approach within the vodou cosmology differs significantly from the biomedical model. Vodou priests use a variety of means to treat patients suffering from mental illness including prayer, leaves for teas and baths, as well as combinations of perfumes, rum, human remains and other powdered concoctions. Additionally, until structural factors that result in entrenched poverty, violence, and political and social chaos can be addressed, already high levels of trauma, and poor physical and mental health, will likely continue to rise. Future research could focus on how to build and expand biomedical mental health services that are culturally-adapted to local explanatory models, and find ways to sustainably collaborate with traditional healers that avoid conflict.

Methods: pubmed, cinahl and psycinfo were searched for abstracts dating from 2000 through to june 2012. Eligible articles concerned education or support for adult cancer patients, and were provided either on the internet or using cd-rom or dvd. Results: twenty-eight quantitative studies constituted the final sample, revealing that supportive e-health programs in the field of cancer are being used and are helpful to individuals despite their age, gender, literacy level and disease-stage. Each e-health program usually constitutes a single service with a variety of multimedia features, which leads to different designs yet with common outcomes. Some of these outcomes are theoretically explained, although a structure that links all aspects of the intervention is rarely found. Moreover, different designs have also been adopted for testing the interventions’ effectiveness. Conclusion: e-health interventions that allow supportive needs to be satisfied are leading to positive effects for individuals with different preferences and priorities. Even though several communalities could be found across interventions, methodological aspects of design, implementation and evaluation still vary, leading to some inconsistency. Models and applied theories are needed to clarify such issues, thus enhancing the credibility and applicability of supportive e-health programs across target populations.

Previously, we demonstrated the protective role of parental responsiveness for reducing the risk of exposure-related disruptive behavior in adolescence. Here, we expanded this line of inquiry, examining whether responsiveness moderates the relation of pte to a broader set of behavioral disinhibition features in early childhood and testing alternative diathesis-stress versus differential susceptibility explanatory models. Pte was assessed prospectively using interviews and bioassays in the midwestern infant development study (mids). Mother-child dyads (n = 276) were re-assessed at approximately 5 years of age in a preschool follow-up. We quantified maternal responsiveness and child behavioral disinhibition using a combination of directly observed activities in the lab and developmentally sensitive questionnaires.
